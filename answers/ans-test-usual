1|"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
1|Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,
1|if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by
1|that Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have
1|nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer
1|my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see
1|I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news."

1|It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna
1|Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya
1|Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man
1|of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her
1|reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as
1|she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in
1|St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

1|delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:

1|"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the
1|prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too
1|terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and
1|10--Annette Scherer."
1|
1|"Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the
1|least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing
1|an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had
1|stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke
1|in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but
1|thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a
1|man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went
1|up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,
1|scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the
1|sofa.
1|
1|"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's
1|mind at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the
1|politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even
1|irony could be discerned.
1|
1|"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times
1|like these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna. "You are
1|staying the whole evening, I hope?"
1|
1|"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I
1|must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is
1|coming for me to take me there."
1|
1|"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these
1|festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."
1|
1|"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would
1|have been put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by
1|force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.
1|
1|"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's
1|dispatch? You know everything."
1|
1|"What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold,
1|listless tone. "What has been decided? They have decided that
1|Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to
1|burn ours."
1|
1|Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a
1|stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty
1|years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an
1|enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she
1|did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to
1|disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile
1|which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played
1|round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual
1|consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor
1|could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.
1|
1|In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna
1|burst out:
1|
1|"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand
1|things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.
1|She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious
1|sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is
1|the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to
1|perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble
1|that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and
1|crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than
1|ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must
1|avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely
1|on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot
1|understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has
1|refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some
1|secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.
1|The English have not understood and cannot understand the
1|self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only
1|desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And
1|what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has
1|always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe
1|is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg
1|says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a
1|trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored
1|monarch. He will save Europe!"
1|
1|She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
1|
1|"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been
1|sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the
1|King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you
1|give me a cup of tea?"
1|
1|"In a moment. A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am
1|expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,
1|who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of
1|the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good
1|ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He
1|has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?"
1|
1|"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But tell me,"
1|he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred
1|to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive
1|of his visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke
1|to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts
1|is a poor creature."
1|
1|Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others
1|were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it
1|for the baron.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she
1|nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or
1|was pleased with.
1|
1|"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her
1|sister," was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
1|
1|As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an
1|expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
1|sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
1|patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron
1|Funke beaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
1|
1|The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the
1|womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna
1|Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of
1|a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,
1|so she said:
1|
1|"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came
1|out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
1|beautiful."
1|
1|The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
1|
1|"I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer
1|to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that
1|political and social topics were ended and the time had come for
1|intimate conversation--"I often think how unfairly sometimes the
1|joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid
1|children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like
1|him," she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her
1|eyebrows. "Two such charming children. And really you appreciate
1|them less than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them."
1|
1|And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
1|
1|"I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I
1|lack the bump of paternity."
1|
1|"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I
1|am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her
1|face assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her
1|Majesty's and you were pitied...."
1|
1|The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
1|awaiting a reply. He frowned.
1|
1|"What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all
1|a father could for their education, and they have both turned out
1|fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active
1|one. That is the only difference between them." He said this smiling
1|in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles
1|round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse
1|and unpleasant.
1|
1|"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a
1|father there would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna
1|Pavlovna, looking up pensively.
1|
1|"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
1|children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That
1|is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!"
1|
1|He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
1|gesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.
1|
1|"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?"
1|she asked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and
1|though I don't feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little
1|person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of
1|yours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya."
1|
1|Prince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory
1|and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a
1|movement of the head that he was considering this information.
1|
1|"Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
1|current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand
1|rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in
1|five years, if he goes on like this?" Presently he added: "That's what
1|we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?"
1|
1|"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He
1|is the well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army
1|under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is
1|very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very
1|unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise
1|Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and will be here
1|tonight."
1|
1|"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna
1|Pavlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange
1|that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe
1|with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is
1|rich and of good family and that's all I want."
1|
1|And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised
1|the maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and
1|fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
1|
1|"Attendez," said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise,
1|young Bolkonski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can
1|be arranged. It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll start my
1|apprenticeship as old maid."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling. The highest
1|Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age
1|and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.
1|Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her
1|father to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball dress and
1|her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess
1|Bolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,* was
1|also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being
1|pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small
1|receptions. Prince Vasili's son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart,
1|whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had also come.
1|
1|
1|*The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
1|
1|
1|To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, "You have not yet seen my
1|aunt," or "You do not know my aunt?" and very gravely conducted him or
1|her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who
1|had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to
1|arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna
1|Pavlovna mentioned each one's name and then left them.
1|
1|Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom
1|not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of
1|them cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful
1|and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of
1|them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health
1|of Her Majesty, "who, thank God, was better today." And each
1|visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left
1|the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious
1|duty and did not return to her the whole evening.
1|
1|The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a
1|gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a
1|delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her
1|teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming
1|when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always
1|the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness
1|of her upper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special
1|and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of
1|this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life
1|and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull
1|dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company
1|and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were
1|becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her,
1|and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her
1|white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that
1|day.
1|
1|The little princess went round the table with quick, short,
1|swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her
1|dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was
1|doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. "I have brought
1|my work," said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all
1|present. "Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick
1|on me," she added, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it was to
1|be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed."
1|And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed,
1|dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.
1|
1|"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone
1|else," replied Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|"You know," said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
1|French, turning to a general, "my husband is deserting me? He is going
1|to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?" she
1|added, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer she
1|turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.
1|
1|"What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince
1|Vasili to Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
1|close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable
1|at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout
1|young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known
1|grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man
1|had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had
1|only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this
1|was his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with
1|the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room.
1|But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and
1|fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the
1|place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was
1|certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety
1|could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant
1|and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else
1|in that drawing room.
1|
1|"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
1|invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her
1|aunt as she conducted him to her.
1|
1|Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look
1|round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to
1|the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate
1|acquaintance.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the
1|aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty's health.
1|Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: "Do you know
1|the Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man."
1|
1|"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
1|interesting but hardly feasible."
1|
1|"You think so?" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and
1|get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now
1|committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady
1|before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak
1|to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big
1|feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the
1|abbe's plan chimerical.
1|
1|"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.
1|
1|And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave,
1|she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch,
1|ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to
1|flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands
1|to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or
1|there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and
1|hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna
1|Pavlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a
1|too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the
1|conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid
1|these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an
1|anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to
1|listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to
1|another group whose center was the abbe.
1|
1|Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna
1|Pavlovna's was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all
1|the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like
1|a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of
1|missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the
1|self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he
1|was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he
1|came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he
1|stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young
1|people are fond of doing.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed
1|steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,
1|beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face
1|was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company
1|had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed
1|round the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the
1|beautiful Princess Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the little
1|Princess Bolkonskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump
1|for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna
1|Pavlovna.
1|
1|The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and
1|polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out
1|of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
1|which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up
1|as a treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a
1|specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen
1|it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served
1|up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly
1|choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing
1|the murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc
1|d'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were
1|particular reasons for Buonaparte's hatred of him.
1|
1|"Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," said Anna Pavlovna,
1|with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in
1|the sound of that sentence: "Contez nous cela, Vicomte."
1|
1|The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness
1|to comply. Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone
1|to listen to his tale.
1|
1|"The vicomte knew the duc personally," whispered Anna Pavlovna to of
1|the guests. "The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said she to
1|another. "How evidently he belongs to the best society," said she to a
1|third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
1|and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef
1|on a hot dish.
1|
1|The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.
1|
1|"Come over here, Helene, dear," said Anna Pavlovna to the
1|beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
1|another group.
1|
1|The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with
1|which she had first entered the room--the smile of a perfectly
1|beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed
1|with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and
1|sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her,
1|not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously
1|allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and
1|shapely shoulders, back, and bosom--which in the fashion of those days
1|were very much exposed--and she seemed to bring the glamour of a
1|ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so
1|lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on
1|the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too
1|victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish
1|its effect.
1|
1|"How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted
1|his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something
1|extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also
1|with her unchanging smile.
1|
1|"Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience," said he,
1|smilingly inclining his head.
1|
1|The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and
1|considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the
1|story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful
1|round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her
1|still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond
1|necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and
1|whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at
1|once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor's
1|face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.
1|
1|The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene.
1|
1|"Wait a moment, I'll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking
1|of?" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. "Fetch me my workbag."
1|
1|There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
1|merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in
1|her seat.
1|
1|"Now I am all right," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she
1|took up her work.
1|
1|Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle
1|and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.
1|
1|Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary
1|resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that
1|in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features
1|were like his sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by
1|a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation,
1|and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the
1|contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of
1|sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes,
1|nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace,
1|and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.
1|
1|"It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside
1|the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
1|instrument he could not begin to speak.
1|
1|"Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging
1|his shoulders.
1|
1|"Because I hate ghost stories," said Prince Hippolyte in a tone
1|which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
1|had uttered them.
1|
1|He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be
1|sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was
1|dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of
1|cuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.
1|
1|The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then
1|current, to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to
1|Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon
1|Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress' favors, and that in
1|his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits
1|to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc's mercy. The latter
1|spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by
1|death.
1|
1|The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
1|where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies
1|looked agitated.
1|
1|"Charming!" said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the
1|little princess.
1|
1|"Charming!" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle
1|into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of
1|the story prevented her from going on with it.
1|
1|The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
1|prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a
1|watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he
1|was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to
1|the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe
1|about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by
1|the young man's simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet
1|theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally,
1|which was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved.
1|
1|"The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of
1|the people," the abbe was saying. "It is only necessary for one
1|powerful nation like Russia--barbaric as she is said to be--to place
1|herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its
1|object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would
1|save the world!"
1|
1|"But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre was beginning.
1|
1|At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at
1|Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The
1|Italian's face instantly changed and assumed an offensively
1|affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing
1|with women.
1|
1|"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
1|society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have
1|had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think
1|of the climate," said he.
1|
1|Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the more
1|conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
1|larger circle.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew
1|Bolkonski, the little princess' husband. He was a very handsome
1|young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features.
1|Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet,
1|measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little
1|wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing
1|room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look
1|at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so
1|tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.
1|He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome
1|face, kissed Anna Pavlovna's hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned
1|the whole company.
1|
1|"You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|"General Kutuzov," said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing the
1|last syllable of the general's name like a Frenchman, "has been
1|pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp...."
1|
1|"And Lise, your wife?"
1|
1|"She will go to the country."
1|
1|"Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?"
1|
1|"Andre," said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
1|coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, "the vicomte has
1|been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who
1|from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with
1|glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he
1|looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance
1|with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre's beaming
1|face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.
1|
1|"There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?" said he to
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. "I will come to supper
1|with you. May I?" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
1|vicomte who was continuing his story.
1|
1|"No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre's
1|hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished
1|to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his
1|daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.
1|
1|"You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said Prince Vasili to the
1|Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
1|his rising. "This unfortunate fete at the ambassador's deprives me
1|of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to
1|leave your enchanting party," said he, turning to Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|His daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly
1|holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
1|radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
1|almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.
1|
1|"Very lovely," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Very," said Pierre.
1|
1|In passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre's hand and said to Anna
1|Pavlovna: "Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a
1|whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.
1|Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever
1|women."
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew
1|his father to be a connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly lady who
1|had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook
1|Prince Vasili in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had
1|assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed
1|only anxiety and fear.
1|
1|"How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, hurrying after him
1|into the anteroom. "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me
1|what news I may take back to my poor boy."
1|
1|Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to
1|the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
1|ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might
1|not go away.
1|
1|"What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he
1|would be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.
1|
1|"Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can," answered
1|Prince Vasili, "but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I
1|should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn.
1|That would be the best way."
1|
1|The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the
1|best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
1|society had lost her former influential connections. She had now
1|come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her
1|only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had
1|obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna's reception and had sat
1|listening to the vicomte's story. Prince Vasili's words frightened
1|her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a
1|moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasili's arm more
1|tightly.
1|
1|"Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have never yet asked you for
1|anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my
1|father's friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God's sake to
1|do this for my son--and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,"
1|she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, but promise! I have asked
1|Golitsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always
1|were," she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.
1|
1|"Papa, we shall be late," said Princess Helene, turning her
1|beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she
1|stood waiting by the door.
1|
1|Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be
1|economized if it is to last. Prince Vasili knew this, and having
1|once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him,
1|he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using
1|his influence. But in Princess Drubetskaya's case he felt, after her
1|second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded
1|him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the
1|first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners
1|that she was one of those women--mostly mothers--who, having once made
1|up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and
1|are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour
1|after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved
1|him.
1|
1|"My dear Anna Mikhaylovna," said he with his usual familiarity and
1|weariness of tone, "it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask;
1|but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father's
1|memory, I will do the impossible--your son shall be transferred to the
1|Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?"
1|
1|"My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you--I knew your
1|kindness!" He turned to go.
1|
1|"Wait--just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards..."
1|she faltered. "You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich
1|Kutuzov... recommend Boris to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at
1|rest, and then..."
1|
1|Prince Vasili smiled.
1|
1|"No, I won't promise that. You don't know how Kutuzov is pestered
1|since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that
1|all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
1|adjutants."
1|
1|"No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My dear benefactor..."
1|
1|"Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,
1|"we shall be late."
1|
1|"Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?"
1|
1|"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"
1|
1|"Certainly; but about Kutuzov, I don't promise."
1|
1|"Do promise, do promise, Vasili!" cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went,
1|with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came
1|naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.
1|
1|Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit
1|employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone
1|her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She
1|returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again
1|pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her
1|task was accomplished.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|"And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at
1|Milan?" asked Anna Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa
1|and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and
1|Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions
1|of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's head whirl! It is
1|as if the whole world had gone crazy."
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a
1|sarcastic smile.
1|
1|"'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!'* They say he was very
1|fine when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in
1|Italian: "'Dio mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!'"
1|
1|
1|*God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!
1|
1|
1|"I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
1|over," Anna Pavlovna continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to
1|endure this man who is a menace to everything."
1|
1|"The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," said the vicomte, polite
1|but hopeless: "The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis
1|XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he
1|became more animated. "And believe me, they are reaping the reward
1|of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they
1|are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper."
1|
1|And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
1|
1|Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
1|through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
1|little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde
1|coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much
1|gravity as if she had asked him to do it.
1|
1|"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d'azur--maison Conde," said
1|he.
1|
1|The princess listened, smiling.
1|
1|"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the
1|vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
1|he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others
1|but follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will have gone
1|too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French
1|society--I mean good French society--will have been forever destroyed,
1|and then..."
1|
1|He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to
1|make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna,
1|who had him under observation, interrupted:
1|
1|"The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which
1|always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family,
1|"has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to
1|choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from
1|the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the
1|arms of its rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
1|royalist emigrant.
1|
1|"That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. "Monsieur le Vicomte quite
1|rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it
1|will be difficult to return to the old regime."
1|
1|"From what I have heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into
1|the conversation, "almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
1|Bonaparte's side."
1|
1|"It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the vicomte
1|without looking at Pierre. "At the present time it is difficult to
1|know the real state of French public opinion."
1|
1|"Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
1|smile.
1|
1|It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
1|remarks at him, though without looking at him.
1|
1|"'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,'"
1|Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
1|Napoleon's words. "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.' I
1|do not know how far he was justified in saying so."
1|
1|"Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "After the murder of the
1|duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
1|people," he went on, turning to Anna Pavlovna, "he ever was a hero,
1|after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and
1|one hero less on earth."
1|
1|Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their
1|appreciation of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the
1|conversation, and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say
1|something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.
1|
1|"The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was
1|a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed
1|greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
1|responsibility of that deed."
1|
1|"Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper.
1|
1|"What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows
1|greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smiling and drawing
1|her work nearer to her.
1|
1|"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices.
1|
1|"Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping
1|his knee with the palm of his hand.
1|
1|The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at
1|his audience over his spectacles and continued.
1|
1|"I say so," he continued desperately, "because the Bourbons fled
1|from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon
1|alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general
1|good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."
1|
1|"Won't you come over to the other table?" suggested Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
1|
1|"No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, "Napoleon is great
1|because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,
1|preserved all that was good in it--equality of citizenship and freedom
1|of speech and of the press--and only for that reason did he obtain
1|power."
1|
1|"Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
1|commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have
1|called him a great man," remarked the vicomte.
1|
1|"He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he
1|might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a
1|great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!" continued Monsieur
1|Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his
1|extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.
1|
1|"What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...
1|But won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|"Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.
1|
1|"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas."
1|
1|"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected
1|an ironical voice.
1|
1|"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most
1|important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation
1|from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas
1|Napoleon has retained in full force."
1|
1|"Liberty and equality," said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at
1|last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
1|were, "high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who
1|does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached
1|liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier?
1|On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it."
1|
1|Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
1|vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment
1|of Pierre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was
1|horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had
1|not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
1|impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the
1|vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.
1|
1|"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the
1|fact of a great man executing a duc--or even an ordinary man who--is
1|innocent and untried?"
1|
1|"I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the
1|18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at
1|all like the conduct of a great man!"
1|
1|"And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the
1|little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
1|
1|"He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hippolyte.
1|
1|Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.
1|His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,
1|his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
1|another--a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed
1|to ask forgiveness.
1|
1|The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly
1|that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested.
1|All were silent.
1|
1|"How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince
1|Andrew. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish
1|between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.
1|So it seems to me."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of
1|this reinforcement.
1|
1|"One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man
1|was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa
1|where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but... but there are
1|other acts which it is difficult to justify."
1|
1|Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness
1|of Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time
1|to go.
1|
1|Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to
1|attend, and asking them all to be seated began:
1|
1|"I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to
1|it. Excuse me, Vicomte--I must tell it in Russian or the point will be
1|lost...." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
1|as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
1|Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
1|attention to his story.
1|
1|"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She
1|must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was
1|her taste. And she had a lady's maid, also big. She said..."
1|
1|Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
1|difficulty.
1|
1|"She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a
1|livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some
1|calls.'"
1|
1|Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long
1|before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the
1|narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna
1|Pavlovna, did however smile.
1|
1|"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat
1|and her long hair came down...." Here he could contain himself no
1|longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: "And the whole world
1|knew...."
1|
1|And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had
1|told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna
1|and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so
1|agreeably ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the
1|anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about
1|the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom,
1|and when and where.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests
1|began to take their leave.
1|
1|Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with
1|huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a
1|drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say
1|something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he
1|was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his
1|own, the general's three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the
1|plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his
1|absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it
1|was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression.
1|Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that
1|expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to
1|see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my
1|dear Monsieur Pierre."
1|
1|When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again
1|everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions
1|are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am."
1|And everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.
1|
1|Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
1|to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
1|indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also
1|come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty,
1|pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.
1|
1|"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," said the little
1|princess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. "It is settled," she added in
1|a low voice.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match
1|she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess'
1|sister-in-law.
1|
1|"I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone.
1|"Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au
1|revoir!"--and she left the hall.
1|
1|Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his
1|face close to her, began to whisper something.
1|
1|Two footmen, the princess' and his own, stood holding a shawl and
1|a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to
1|the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
1|understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as
1|usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.
1|
1|"I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador's," said Prince
1|Hippolyte "-so dull-. It has been a delightful evening, has it not?
1|Delightful!"
1|
1|"They say the ball will be very good," replied the princess, drawing
1|up her downy little lip. "All the pretty women in society will be
1|there."
1|
1|"Not all, for you will not be there; not all," said Prince Hippolyte
1|smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he
1|even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either
1|from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after
1|the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long
1|time, as though embracing her.
1|
1|Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at
1|her husband. Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did
1|he seem.
1|
1|"Are you ready?" he asked his wife, looking past her.
1|
1|Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest
1|fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out
1|into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into
1|the carriage.
1|
1|"Princesse, au revoir," cried he, stumbling with his tongue as
1|well as with his feet.
1|
1|The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the
1|dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince
1|Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone's way.
1|
1|"Allow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,
1|disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.
1|
1|"I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same voice, but gently and
1|affectionately.
1|
1|The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte
1|laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
1|whom he had promised to take home.
1|
1|"Well, mon cher," said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
1|Hippolyte in the carriage, "your little princess is very nice, very
1|nice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the tips of his fingers.
1|Hippolyte burst out laughing.
1|
1|"Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,"
1|continued the vicomte. "I pity the poor husband, that little officer
1|who gives himself the airs of a monarch."
1|
1|Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, "And you
1|were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One
1|has to know how to deal with them."
1|
1|
1|Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like
1|one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa,
1|took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was
1|Caesar's Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it
1|in the middle.
1|
1|"What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite ill now,"
1|said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white
1|hands.
1|
1|Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his
1|eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.
1|
1|"That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in
1|the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but--I
1|do not know how to express it... not by a balance of political
1|power...."
1|
1|It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such
1|abstract conversation.
1|
1|"One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you
1|at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a
1|diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.
1|
1|Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.
1|
1|"Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either the one or the
1|other."
1|
1|"But you must decide on something! Your father expects it."
1|
1|Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor,
1|and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow
1|his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man, "Now go to
1|Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to
1|anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, and here is money.
1|Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything." Pierre
1|had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not
1|decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was
1|speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.
1|
1|"But he must be a Freemason," said he, referring to the abbe whom he
1|had met that evening.
1|
1|"That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew again interrupted him, "let us
1|talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?"
1|
1|"No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to
1|tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for
1|freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the
1|army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in
1|the world is not right."
1|
1|Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish
1|words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to
1|such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any
1|other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question.
1|
1|"If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no
1|wars," he said.
1|
1|"And that would be splendid," said Pierre.
1|
1|Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
1|
1|"Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about..."
1|
1|"Well, why are you going to the war?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going..." He
1|paused. "I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit
1|me!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room. Prince
1|Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it
1|had had in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room. Pierre removed his feet
1|from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a
1|house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose
1|and politely placed a chair for her.
1|
1|"How is it," she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly
1|and fussily in the easy chair, "how is it Annette never got married?
1|How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for
1|saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative
1|fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!"
1|
1|"And I am still arguing with your husband. I can't understand why he
1|wants to go to the war," replied Pierre, addressing the princess
1|with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
1|intercourse with young women.
1|
1|The princess started. Evidently Pierre's words touched her to the
1|quick.
1|
1|"Ah, that is just what I tell him!" said she. "I don't understand
1|it; I don't in the least understand why men can't live without wars.
1|How is it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need
1|it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is
1|Uncle's aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well
1|known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the
1|Apraksins' I heard a lady asking, 'Is that the famous Prince
1|Andrew?' I did indeed." She laughed. "He is so well received
1|everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You
1|know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were
1|speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?"
1|
1|Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
1|conversation, gave no reply.
1|
1|"When are you starting?" he asked.
1|
1|"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't hear it spoken of,"
1|said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had
1|spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly
1|ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.
1|"Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must
1|be broken off... and then you know, Andre..." (she looked
1|significantly at her husband) "I'm afraid, I'm afraid!" she whispered,
1|and a shudder ran down her back.
1|
1|Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone
1|besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a
1|tone of frigid politeness.
1|
1|"What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't understand," said he.
1|
1|"There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a
1|whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up
1|alone in the country."
1|
1|"With my father and sister, remember," said Prince Andrew gently.
1|
1|"Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to
1|be afraid."
1|
1|Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
1|joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if
1|she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though
1|the gist of the matter lay in that.
1|
1|"I still can't understand what you are afraid of," said Prince
1|Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.
1|
1|The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.
1|
1|"No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have..."
1|
1|"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," said Prince Andrew.
1|"You had better go."
1|
1|The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip
1|quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about
1|the room.
1|
1|Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now at him
1|and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.
1|
1|"Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?" exclaimed the little
1|princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a
1|tearful grimace. "I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you
1|have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the
1|war and have no pity for me. Why is it?"
1|
1|"Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an
1|entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
1|regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:
1|
1|"You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you
1|behave like that six months ago?"
1|
1|"Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince Andrew still more
1|emphatically.
1|
1|Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened
1|to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to
1|bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.
1|
1|"Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because... I assure you
1|I myself have experienced... and so... because... No, excuse me! An
1|outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress yourself...
1|Good-by!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.
1|
1|"No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of
1|the pleasure of spending the evening with you."
1|
1|"No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the princess without
1|restraining her angry tears.
1|
1|"Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch
1|which indicates that patience is exhausted.
1|
1|Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess' pretty
1|face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful
1|eyes glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the
1|timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags
1|its drooping tail.
1|
1|"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one
1|hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.
1|
1|"Good night, Lise," said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand
1|as he would have done to a stranger.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre
1|continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his
1|forehead with his small hand.
1|
1|"Let us go and have supper," he said with a sigh, going to the door.
1|
1|They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining
1|room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and
1|glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the
1|newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his
1|elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as
1|Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk--as one who
1|has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak
1|out.
1|
1|"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry
1|till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable
1|of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and
1|have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and
1|irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing--or
1|all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be
1|wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise.
1|If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you
1|will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed
1|except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with
1|a court lackey and an idiot!... But what's the good?..." and he
1|waved his arm.
1|
1|Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different
1|and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at
1|his friend in amazement.
1|
1|"My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is an excellent woman, one of
1|those rare women with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, what
1|would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one
1|to whom I mention this, because I like you."
1|
1|As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski
1|who had lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half-closed
1|eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his
1|thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in
1|which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with
1|brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at
1|ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of
1|almost morbid irritation.
1|
1|"You don't understand why I say this," he continued, "but it is
1|the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said
1|he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), "but Bonaparte when he
1|worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had
1|nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself
1|up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And
1|all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and
1|torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and
1|triviality--these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I
1|am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know
1|nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic
1|wit," continued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen
1|to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and
1|those women... If you only knew what those society women are, and
1|women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial
1|in everything--that's what women are when you see them in their true
1|colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were
1|something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don't
1|marry, my dear fellow; don't marry!" concluded Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should
1|consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have
1|everything before you, everything. And you..."
1|
1|He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he
1|thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.
1|
1|"How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre. He considered his
1|friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the
1|highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which
1|might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always
1|astonished at Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his
1|extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything,
1|knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all
1|at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck
1|by Andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he
1|himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a
1|defect but as a sign of strength.
1|
1|Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life,
1|praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary
1|to wheels that they may run smoothly.
1|
1|"My part is played out," said Prince Andrew. "What's the use of
1|talking about me? Let us talk about you," he added after a silence,
1|smiling at his reassuring thoughts.
1|
1|That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.
1|
1|"But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face
1|relaxing into a careless, merry smile. "What am I? An illegitimate
1|son!" He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a
1|great effort to say this. "Without a name and without means... And
1|it really..." But he did not say what "it really" was. "For the
1|present I am free and am all right. Only I haven't the least idea what
1|I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously."
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance--friendly and
1|affectionate as it was--expressed a sense of his own superiority.
1|
1|"I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among
1|our whole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you will; it's all
1|the same. You'll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up
1|visiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so
1|badly--all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!"
1|
1|"What would you have, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre, shrugging
1|his shoulders. "Women, my dear fellow; women!"
1|
1|"I don't understand it," replied Prince Andrew. "Women who are comme
1|il faut, that's a different matter; but the Kuragins' set of women,
1|'women and wine' I don't understand!"
1|
1|Pierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin's and sharing the
1|dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to
1|reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.
1|
1|"Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy
1|thought, "seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading
1|such a life I can't decide or think properly about anything. One's
1|head aches, and one spends all one's money. He asked me for tonight,
1|but I won't go."
1|
1|"You give me your word of honor not to go?"
1|
1|"On my honor!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a
1|cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending
1|to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more
1|he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was
1|light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed
1|more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre
1|remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for
1|cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout,
1|finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.
1|
1|"I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought he.
1|
1|But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go
1|there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
1|passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so
1|accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately
1|occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account,
1|because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to
1|come to his gathering; "besides," thought he, "all such 'words of
1|honor' are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if
1|one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so
1|extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all
1|the same!" Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort,
1|nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kuragin's.
1|
1|Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which
1|Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the
1|stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the
1|anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there
1|was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the
1|distance.
1|
1|Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet
1|dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in
1|which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw
1|him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the
1|third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices,
1|the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine
1|young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others
1|were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and
1|trying to set him at the others.
1|
1|"I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one.
1|
1|"Mind, no holding on!" cried another.
1|
1|"I bet on Dolokhov!" cried a third. "Kuragin, you part our hands."
1|
1|"There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on."
1|
1|"At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a fourth.
1|
1|"Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow
1|who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine
1|linen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here
1|is Petya! Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.
1|
1|Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
1|particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
1|ring, cried from the window: "Come here; part the bets!" This was
1|Dolokhov, an officer of the Semenov regiment, a notorious gambler
1|and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about
1|him merrily.
1|
1|"I don't understand. What's it all about?"
1|
1|"Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here," said Anatole,
1|taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.
1|
1|"First of all you must drink!"
1|
1|Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows
1|at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and
1|listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass
1|while explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens, an English
1|naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the
1|outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.
1|
1|"Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
1|glass, "or I won't let you go!"
1|
1|"No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to
1|the window.
1|
1|Dolokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and
1|distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself
1|particularly to Anatole and Pierre.
1|
1|Dolokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue
1|eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore
1|no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face,
1|was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely
1|curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed
1|firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles
1|played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this,
1|together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes,
1|produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.
1|Dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though
1|Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dolokhov lived with him and
1|had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including
1|Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dolokhov
1|could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank,
1|he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at
1|that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.
1|
1|The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented
1|anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two
1|footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions
1|and shouts of the gentlemen around.
1|
1|Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted
1|to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame,
1|but could not move it. He smashed a pane.
1|
1|"You have a try, Hercules," said he, turning to Pierre.
1|
1|Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame
1|out with a crash.
1|
1|"Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said Dolokhov.
1|
1|"Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.
1|
1|"First-rate," said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who with a bottle of
1|rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of
1|the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.
1|
1|Dolokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the
1|window sill. "Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those
1|in the room. All were silent.
1|
1|"I bet fifty imperials"--he spoke French that the Englishman might
1|understand him, but he did, not speak it very well--"I bet fifty
1|imperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he,
1|addressing the Englishman.
1|
1|"No, fifty," replied the latter.
1|
1|"All right. Fifty imperials... that I will drink a whole bottle of
1|rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on
1|this spot" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the
1|window) "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"
1|
1|"Quite right," said the Englishman.
1|
1|Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
1|of his coat and looking down at him--the Englishman was short--began
1|repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
1|
1|"Wait!" cried Dolokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill
1|to attract attention. "Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone else
1|does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?"
1|
1|The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to
1|accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and
1|though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on
1|translating Dolokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar
1|of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the
1|window sill, leaned over, and looked down.
1|
1|"Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the
1|stones of the pavement.
1|
1|"Shut up!" cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad
1|jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
1|
1|Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it
1|easily, Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and
1|lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he
1|adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the
1|right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought
1|two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was
1|already quite light. Dolokhov's back in his white shirt, and his curly
1|head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the
1|Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older
1|than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and
1|angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov's shirt.
1|
1|"I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible
1|man.
1|
1|Anatole stopped him.
1|
1|"Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed.
1|Eh?... What then?... Eh?"
1|
1|Dolokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands,
1|arranged himself on his seat.
1|
1|"If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words
1|separately through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down
1|there. Now then!"
1|
1|Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the
1|bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised
1|his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped
1|to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without
1|taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhov's back. Anatole
1|stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways,
1|pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran
1|to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to
1|the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade
1|though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still.
1|Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov still sat in the same
1|position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair
1|touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted
1|higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was
1|emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting
1|yet further back. "Why is it so long?" thought Pierre. It seemed to
1|him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made
1|a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously;
1|this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the
1|sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered
1|still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the
1|window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered
1|his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he
1|was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on
1|the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.
1|
1|"It's empty."
1|
1|He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.
1|Dolokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.
1|
1|"Well done!... Fine fellow!... There's a bet for you!... Devil
1|take you!" came from different sides.
1|
1|The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the
1|money. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon
1|the window sill.
1|
1|"Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll do the same thing!" he
1|suddenly cried. "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
1|bottle. I'll do it.... Bring a bottle!"
1|
1|"Let him do it, let him do it," said Dolokhov, smiling.
1|
1|"What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why,
1|you go giddy even on a staircase," exclaimed several voices.
1|
1|"I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre, banging
1|the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb
1|out of the window.
1|
1|They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone
1|who touched him was sent flying.
1|
1|"No, you'll never manage him that way," said Anatole. "Wait a bit
1|and I'll get round him.... Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, but
1|now we are all going to ----'s."
1|
1|"Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin with
1|us."
1|
1|And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the
1|ground, and began dancing round the room with it.
1|
1|

1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess
1|Drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on
1|the evening of Anna Pavlovna's soiree. The matter was mentioned to the
1|Emperor, an exception made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of
1|Semenov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no
1|appointment to Kutuzov's staff despite all Anna Mikhaylovna's
1|endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pavlovna's reception Anna
1|Mikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich
1|relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when in the town and
1|where her darling Bory, who had only just entered a regiment
1|of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a
1|cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a
1|time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August,
1|and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join
1|them on the march to Radzivilov.
1|
1|It was St. Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rostovs--the
1|mother and the youngest daughter--both named Nataly. Ever since the
1|morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
1|continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostova's big house
1|on the Povarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself
1|and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing-room with the
1|visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one
1|another in relays.
1|
1|The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental
1|type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing--she had had
1|twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness,
1|gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna
1|Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also
1|seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the
1|visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not
1|considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The
1|count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.
1|
1|"I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher," or "ma chere"--he
1|called everyone without exception and without the slightest
1|variation in his tone, "my dear," whether they were above or below him
1|in rank--"I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose
1|name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be
1|offended, ma chere! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come,
1|mon cher!" These words he repeated to everyone without exception or
1|variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful,
1|clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same
1|quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned
1|to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair
1|toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his
1|hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how
1|to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the
1|weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and
1|sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a
1|man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see
1|some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald
1|patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the
1|anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the
1|large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty
1|people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and
1|china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would
1|call Dmitri Vasilevich, a man of good family and the manager of all
1|his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table
1|would say: "Well, Dmitri, you'll see that things are all as they
1|should be? That's right! The great thing is the serving, that's it."
1|And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.
1|
1|"Marya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter!" announced the countess'
1|gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The
1|countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with
1|her husband's portrait on it.
1|
1|"I'm quite worn out by these callers. However, I'll see her and no
1|more. She is so affected. Ask her in," she said to the footman in a
1|sad voice, as if saying: "Very well, finish me off."
1|
1|A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling
1|daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.
1|
1|"Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child...
1|at the Razumovski's ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so
1|delighted..." came the sounds of animated feminine voices,
1|interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and
1|the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which
1|last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of
1|dresses and say, "I am so delighted... Mamma's health... and
1|Countess Apraksina..." and then, again rustling, pass into the
1|anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation
1|was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and
1|celebrated beau of Catherine's day, Count Bezukhov, and about his
1|illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna
1|Pavlovna's reception.
1|
1|"I am so sorry for the poor count," said the visitor. "He is in such
1|bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill
1|him!"
1|
1|"What is that?" asked the countess as if she did not know what the
1|visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of
1|Count Bezukhov's distress some fifteen times.
1|
1|"That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed the visitor.
1|"It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as
1|he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible
1|things that he has been expelled by the police."
1|
1|"You don't say so!" replied the countess.
1|
1|"He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Prince
1|Vasili's son, he, and a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been up
1|to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.
1|Dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhov's son sent back
1|to Moscow. Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's
1|affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg."
1|
1|"But what have they been up to?" asked the countess.
1|
1|"They are regular brigands, especially Dolokhov," replied the
1|visitor. "He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, such a worthy
1|woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear
1|somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some
1|actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men
1|do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear
1|into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the
1|policeman on his back!"
1|
1|"What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!" shouted
1|the count, dying with laughter.
1|
1|"Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?"
1|
1|Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.
1|
1|"It was all they could do to rescue the poor man," continued the
1|visitor. "And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's son who
1|amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so
1|well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has
1|done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in
1|spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite
1|declined: I have my daughters to consider."
1|
1|"Why do you say this young man is so rich?" asked the countess,
1|turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of
1|inattention. "His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also
1|is illegitimate."
1|
1|The visitor made a gesture with her hand.
1|
1|"I should think he has a score of them."
1|
1|Princess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation,
1|evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went
1|on in society.
1|
1|"The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a
1|half whisper, "everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has lost
1|count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite."
1|
1|"How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!" remarked the
1|countess. "I have never seen a handsomer man."
1|
1|"He is very much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "Well, as I
1|was saying, Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the
1|count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to
1|the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death--and he is
1|so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from
1|Petersburg--no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune,
1|Pierre or Prince Vasili. Forty thousand serfs and millions of
1|rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasili told me himself.
1|Besides, Cyril Vladimirovich is my mother's second cousin. He's also
1|my Bory's godfather," she added, as if she attached no importance at
1|all to the fact.
1|
1|"Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on
1|some inspection business," remarked the visitor.
1|
1|"Yes, but between ourselves," said the princess, "that is a
1|pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladimirovich,
1|hearing how ill he is."
1|
1|"But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke," said the count;
1|and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to
1|the young ladies. "I can just imagine what a funny figure that
1|policeman cut!"
1|
1|And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly
1|form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who
1|always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. "So do come and dine
1|with us!" he said.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,
1|but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they
1|now rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter was already
1|smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when
1|suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls
1|running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a
1|girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin
1|frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was
1|evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far.
1|Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat
1|collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump
1|rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.
1|
1|The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his
1|arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.
1|
1|"Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. "My pet, whose name day it
1|is. My dear pet!"
1|
1|"Ma chere, there is a time for everything," said the countess with
1|feigned severity. "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her
1|husband.
1|
1|"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your
1|name day," said the visitor. "What a charming child," she added,
1|addressing the mother.
1|
1|This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life--with
1|childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her
1|bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs
1|in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers--was just at that
1|charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not
1|yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her
1|flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla--not paying the
1|least attention to her severe remark--and began to laugh. She laughed,
1|and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she
1|produced from the folds of her frock.
1|
1|"Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see..." was all Natasha
1|managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned
1|against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter
1|that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.
1|
1|"Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you," said the
1|mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and
1|turning to the visitor she added: "She is my youngest girl."
1|
1|Natasha, raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla,
1|glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.
1|
1|The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it
1|necessary to take some part in it.
1|
1|"Tell me, my dear," said she to Natasha, "is Mimi a relation of
1|yours? A daughter, I suppose?"
1|
1|Natasha did not like the visitor's tone of condescension to childish
1|things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.
1|
1|Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna
1|Mikhaylovna's son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest
1|son; Sonya, the count's fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya,
1|his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were
1|obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the
1|excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the
1|back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the
1|conversation had been more amusing than the drawing-room talk of
1|society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apraksina. Now and then
1|they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.
1|
1|The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from
1|childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though
1|not alike. Boris was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had
1|regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and
1|an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper
1|lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas
1|blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find
1|something to say, but failed. Boris on the contrary at once found
1|his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that
1|doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was
1|broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and
1|how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he
1|glanced at Natasha. She turned away from him and glanced at her
1|younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with
1|suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she
1|jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet
1|would carry her. Boris did not laugh.
1|
1|"You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you want the
1|carriage?" he asked his mother with a smile.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready," she answered,
1|returning his smile.
1|
1|Boris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha. The plump
1|boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been
1|disturbed.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting
1|the young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who was four
1|years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up
1|person), were Nicholas and Sonya, the niece. Sonya was a slender
1|little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by
1|long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a
1|tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her
1|slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her
1|movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and
1|by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a
1|pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful
1|little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest
1|in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her
1|eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to
1|join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile
1|could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear
1|that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy
1|and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natasha
1|and Boris, escape from the drawing room.
1|
1|"Ah yes, my dear," said the count, addressing the visitor and
1|pointing to Nicholas, "his friend Boris has become an officer, and
1|so for friendship's sake he is leaving the university and me, his
1|old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there
1|was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department!
1|Isn't that friendship?" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.
1|
1|"But they say that war has been declared," replied the visitor.
1|
1|"They've been saying so a long while," said the count, "and
1|they'll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My
1|dear, there's friendship for you," he repeated. "He's joining the
1|hussars."
1|
1|The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.
1|
1|"It's not at all from friendship," declared Nicholas, flaring up and
1|turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. "It is not from
1|friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation."
1|
1|He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were
1|both regarding him with a smile of approbation.
1|
1|"Schubert, the colonel of the Pavlograd Hussars, is dining with us
1|today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.
1|It can't be helped!" said the count, shrugging his shoulders and
1|speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.
1|
1|"I have already told you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't
1|wish to let me go, I'll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except
1|in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.--I don't
1|know how to hide what I feel." As he spoke he kept glancing with the
1|flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady
1|visitor.
1|
1|The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any
1|moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.
1|
1|"All right, all right!" said the old count. "He always flares up!
1|This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he
1|rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,"
1|he added, not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile.
1|
1|The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karagina turned to
1|young Rostov.
1|
1|"What a pity you weren't at the Arkharovs' on Thursday. It was so
1|dull without you," said she, giving him a tender smile.
1|
1|The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
1|smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
1|without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the
1|heart of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of
1|his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry
1|glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the
1|artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All
1|Nicholas' animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the
1|conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find
1|Sonya.
1|
1|"How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
1|sleeves!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went
1|out. "Cousinage--dangereux voisinage;"* she added.
1|
1|
1|*Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
1|
1|
1|"Yes," said the countess when the brightness these young people
1|had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question
1|no one had put but which was always in her mind, "and how much
1|suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might
1|rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than
1|the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age,
1|so dangerous both for girls and boys."
1|
1|"It all depends on the bringing up," remarked the visitor.
1|
1|"Yes, you're quite right," continued the countess. "Till now I
1|have always, thank God, been my children's friend and had their full
1|confidence," said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who
1|imagine that their children have no secrets from them. "I know I shall
1|always be my daughters' first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with
1|his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can't help it), he
1|will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men."
1|
1|"Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters," chimed in the
1|count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by
1|deciding that everything was splendid. "Just fancy: wants to be an
1|hussar. What's one to do, my dear?"
1|
1|"What a charming creature your younger girl is," said the visitor;
1|"a little volcano!"
1|
1|"Yes, a regular volcano," said the count. "Takes after me! And
1|what a voice she has; though she's my daughter, I tell the truth
1|when I say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an
1|Italian to give her lessons."
1|
1|"Isn't she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to
1|train it at that age."
1|
1|"Oh no, not at all too young!" replied the count. "Why, our
1|mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen."
1|
1|"And she's in love with Boris already. Just fancy!" said the
1|countess with a gentle smile, looking at Boris' and went on, evidently
1|concerned with a thought that always occupied her: "Now you see if I
1|were to be severe with her and to forbid it... goodness knows what
1|they might be up to on the sly" (she meant that they would be
1|kissing), "but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come
1|running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything.
1|Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her
1|elder sister I was stricter."
1|
1|"Yes, I was brought up quite differently," remarked the handsome
1|elder daughter, Countess Vera, with a smile.
1|
1|But the smile did not enhance Vera's beauty as smiles generally do; on
1|the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,
1|expression. Vera was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at
1|learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said
1|was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone--the visitors
1|and countess alike--turned to look at her as if wondering why she had
1|said it, and they all felt awkward.
1|
1|"People are always too clever with their eldest children and try
1|to make something exceptional of them," said the visitor.
1|
1|"What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too
1|clever with Vera," said the count. "Well, what of that? She's turned
1|out splendidly all the same," he added, winking at Vera.
1|
1|The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to
1|dinner.
1|
1|"What manners! I thought they would never go," said the countess,
1|when she had seen her guests out.
1|
1|

1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
1|conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation
1|in the drawing room, waiting for Boris to come out. She was already
1|growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not
1|coming at once, when she heard the young man's discreet steps
1|approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natasha dashed swiftly
1|among the flower tubs and hid there.
1|
1|Boris paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a
1|little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror
1|examined his handsome face. Natasha, very still, peered out from her
1|ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while
1|before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natasha
1|was about to call him but changed her mind. "Let him look for me,"
1|thought she. Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears,
1|and muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Natasha checked
1|her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place,
1|watching--as under an invisible cap--to see what went on in the world.
1|She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sonya, muttering
1|to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing-room door. It opened
1|and Nicholas came in.
1|
1|"Sonya, what is the matter with you? How can you?" said he,
1|running up to her.
1|
1|"It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!" sobbed Sonya.
1|
1|"Ah, I know what it is."
1|
1|"Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!"
1|
1|"So-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like
1|that, for a mere fancy?" said Nicholas taking her hand.
1|
1|Sonya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natasha, not
1|stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with
1|sparkling eyes. "What will happen now?" thought she.
1|
1|"Sonya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are
1|everything!" said Nicholas. "And I will prove it to you."
1|
1|"I don't like you to talk like that."
1|
1|"Well, then, I won't; only forgive me, Sonya!" He drew her to him
1|and kissed her.
1|
1|"Oh, how nice," thought Natasha; and when Sonya and Nicholas had
1|gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to her.
1|
1|"Boris, come here," said she with a sly and significant look. "I
1|have something to tell you. Here, here!" and she led him into the
1|conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.
1|
1|Boris followed her, smiling.
1|
1|"What is the something?" asked he.
1|
1|She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had
1|thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.
1|
1|"Kiss the doll," said she.
1|
1|Boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
1|reply.
1|
1|"Don't you want to? Well, then, come here," said she, and went
1|further in among the plants and threw down the doll. "Closer, closer!"
1|she whispered.
1|
1|She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity
1|and fear appeared on her flushed face.
1|
1|"And me? Would you like to kiss me?" she whispered almost inaudibly,
1|glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying
1|from excitement.
1|
1|Boris blushed.
1|
1|"How funny you are!" he said, bending down to her and blushing still
1|more, but he waited and did nothing.
1|
1|Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him
1|so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and,
1|tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.
1|
1|Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of
1|the tubs and stood, hanging her head.
1|
1|"Natasha," he said, "you know that I love you, but..."
1|
1|"You are in love with me?" Natasha broke in.
1|
1|"Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like that.... In another four
1|years... then I will ask for your hand."
1|
1|Natasha considered.
1|
1|"Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she counted on her slender
1|little fingers. "All right! Then it's settled?"
1|
1|A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.
1|
1|"Settled!" replied Boris.
1|
1|"Forever?" said the little girl. "Till death itself?"
1|
1|She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the
1|adjoining sitting room.
1|
1|

1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she
1|gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to
1|invite to dinner all who came "to congratulate." The countess wished
1|to have a tete-a-tete talk with the friend of her childhood,
1|Princess Anna Mikhaylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she
1|returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikhaylovna, with her tear-worn but
1|pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.
1|
1|"With you I will be quite frank," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "There
1|are not many left of us old friends! That's why I so value your
1|friendship."
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused. The countess pressed her
1|friend's hand.
1|
1|"Vera," she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
1|favorite, "how is it you have so little tact? Don't you see you are
1|not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or..."
1|
1|The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all
1|hurt.
1|
1|"If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone," she replied
1|as she rose to go to her own room.
1|
1|But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples
1|sitting, one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully.
1|Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses
1|for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were at
1|the other window and ceased talking when Vera entered. Sonya and
1|Natasha looked at Vera with guilty, happy faces.
1|
1|It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love;
1|but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vera.
1|
1|"How often have I asked you not to take my things?" she said. "You
1|have a room of your own," and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.
1|
1|"In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping his pen.
1|
1|"You always manage to do things at the wrong time," continued
1|Vera. "You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt
1|ashamed of you."
1|
1|Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no
1|one replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered
1|in the room with the inkstand in her hand.
1|
1|"And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and
1|Boris, or between you two? It's all nonsense!"
1|
1|"Now, Vera, what does it matter to you?" said Natasha in defense,
1|speaking very gently.
1|
1|She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
1|everyone.
1|
1|"Very silly," said Vera. "I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!"
1|
1|"All have secrets of their own," answered Natasha, getting warmer.
1|"We don't interfere with you and Berg."
1|
1|"I should think not," said Vera, "because there can never be
1|anything wrong in my behavior. But I'll just tell Mamma how you are
1|behaving with Boris."
1|
1|"Natalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me," remarked Boris. "I have
1|nothing to complain of."
1|
1|"Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that it is really
1|tiresome," said Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.
1|(She used the word "diplomat," which was just then much in vogue among
1|the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) "Why does she
1|bother me?" And she added, turning to Vera, "You'll never understand
1|it, because you've never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a
1|Madame de Genlis and nothing more" (this nickname, bestowed on Vera by
1|Nicholas, was considered very stinging), "and your greatest pleasure
1|is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you
1|please," she finished quickly.
1|
1|"I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors..."
1|
1|"Well, now you've done what you wanted," put in Nicholas--"said
1|unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let's go to the
1|nursery."
1|
1|All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.
1|
1|"The unpleasant things were said to me," remarked Vera, "I said none
1|to anyone."
1|
1|"Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!" shouted laughing voices
1|through the door.
1|
1|The handsome Vera, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant
1|effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been
1|said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and
1|scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still
1|colder and calmer.
1|
1|
1|In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses
1|either. Don't I know that at the rate we are living our means won't
1|last long? It's all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the
1|country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows
1|what besides! But don't let's talk about me; tell me how you managed
1|everything. I often wonder at you, Annette--how at your age you can
1|rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those
1|ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It's
1|quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn't possibly
1|do it."
1|
1|"Ah, my love," answered Anna Mikhaylovna, "God grant you never
1|know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you
1|love to distraction! One learns many things then," she added with a
1|certain pride. "That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of
1|those big people I write a note: 'Princess So-and-So desires an
1|interview with So and-So,' and then I take a cab and go myself two,
1|three, or four times--till I get what I want. I don't mind what they
1|think of me."
1|
1|"Well, and to whom did you apply about Bory?" asked the countess.
1|"You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my
1|Nicholas is going as a cadet. There's no one to interest himself for
1|him. To whom did you apply?"
1|
1|"To Prince Vasili. He was so kind. He at once agreed to
1|everything, and put the matter before the Emperor," said Princess Anna
1|Mikhaylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she
1|had endured to gain her end.
1|
1|"Has Prince Vasili aged much?" asked the countess. "I have not
1|seen him since we acted together at the Rumyantsovs' theatricals. I
1|expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days," said
1|the countess, with a smile.
1|
1|"He is just the same as ever," replied Anna Mikhaylovna,
1|"overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head
1|at all. He said to me, 'I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear
1|Princess. I am at your command.' Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very
1|kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do
1|anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way
1|that my position is now a terrible one," continued Anna Mikhaylovna,
1|sadly, dropping her voice. "My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and
1|makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a
1|penny and don't know how to equip Boris." She took out her
1|handkerchief and began to cry. "I need five hundred rubles, and have
1|only one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope
1|now is in Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov. If he will not assist
1|his godson--you know he is Bory's godfather--and allow him something
1|for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I
1|shall not be able to equip him."
1|
1|The countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.
1|
1|"I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," said the princess,
1|"that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich, all
1|alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It's a
1|burden to him, and Bory's life is only just beginning...."
1|
1|"Surely he will leave something to Boris," said the countess.
1|
1|"Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
1|Still, I will take Boris and go to see him at once, and I shall
1|speak to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it's
1|really all the same to me when my son's fate is at stake." The
1|princess rose. "It's now two o'clock and you dine at four. There
1|will just be time."
1|
1|And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the
1|most of time, Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son, and
1|went into the anteroom with him.
1|
1|"Good-by, my dear," said she to the countess who saw her to the
1|door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, "Wish me
1|good luck."
1|
1|"Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich, my dear?" said the
1|count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:
1|"If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the
1|house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite
1|him, my dear. We will see how Taras distinguishes himself today. He
1|says Count Orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will be!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|"My dear Boris," said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna to her son as
1|Countess Rostova's carriage in which they were seated drove over the
1|straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril
1|Vladimirovich Bezukhov's house. "My dear Boris," said the mother,
1|drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and
1|tenderly on her son's arm, "be affectionate and attentive to him.
1|Count Cyril Vladimirovich is your godfather after all, your future
1|depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you
1|so well know how to be."
1|
1|"If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
1|it..." answered her son coldly. "But I have promised and will do it
1|for your sake."
1|
1|Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the
1|entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
1|be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
1|rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady's old
1|cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses,
1|and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency
1|was worse today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
1|
1|"We may as well go back," said the son in French.
1|
1|"My dear!" exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand
1|on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
1|
1|Boris said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without
1|taking off his cloak.
1|
1|"My friend," said Anna Mikhaylovna in gentle tones, addressing the
1|hall porter, "I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very ill... that's
1|why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my
1|friend... I only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich: he is staying
1|here, is he not? Please announce me."
1|
1|The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and
1|turned away.
1|
1|"Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich," he called to
1|a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,
1|who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.
1|
1|The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a
1|large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes
1|briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.
1|
1|"My dear," she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a
1|touch, "you promised me!"
1|
1|The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
1|
1|They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to
1|the apartments assigned to Prince Vasili.
1|
1|Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall,
1|were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as
1|they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and
1|Prince Vasili came out--wearing a velvet coat with a single star on
1|his breast, as was his custom when at home--taking leave of a
1|good-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg
1|doctor, Lorrain.
1|
1|"Then it is certain?" said the prince.
1|
1|"Prince, humanum est errare,* but..." replied the doctor, swallowing
1|his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.
1|
1|
1|*To err is human.
1|
1|
1|"Very well, very well..."
1|
1|Seeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her son, Prince Vasili dismissed the
1|doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of
1|inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow
1|suddenly clouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.
1|
1|"Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our
1|dear invalid?" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive
1|look fixed on her.
1|
1|Prince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and
1|perplexed. Boris bowed politely. Prince Vasili without acknowledging
1|the bow turned to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a
1|movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the
1|patient.
1|
1|"Is it possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Oh, how awful! It
1|is terrible to think.... This is my son," she added, indicating Boris.
1|"He wanted to thank you himself."
1|
1|Boris bowed again politely.
1|
1|"Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget what you
1|have done for us."
1|
1|"I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna
1|Mikhaylovna," said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, and in
1|tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed
1|under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than
1|he had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherer's reception.
1|
1|"Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," added he, addressing
1|Boris with severity. "I am glad.... Are you here on leave?" he went on
1|in his usual tone of indifference.
1|
1|"I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,"
1|replied Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque
1|manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so
1|quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.
1|
1|"Are you living with your mother?"
1|
1|"I am living at Countess Rostova's," replied Boris, again adding,
1|"your excellency."
1|
1|"That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina," said
1|Anna Mikhaylovna.
1|
1|"I know, I know," answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice. "I
1|never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that
1|unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler
1|too, I am told."
1|
1|"But a very kind man, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic
1|smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure,
1|but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. "What do the
1|doctors say?" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again
1|expressing deep sorrow.
1|
1|"They give little hope," replied the prince.
1|
1|"And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me
1|and Boris. He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that this
1|fact ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction.
1|
1|Prince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikhaylovna saw
1|that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhov's
1|fortune, and hastened to reassure him.
1|
1|"If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,"
1|said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern,
1|"I know his character: noble, upright... but you see he has no one
1|with him except the young princesses.... They are still young...." She
1|bent her head and continued in a whisper: "Has he performed his
1|final duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can
1|make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if
1|he is so ill. We women, Prince," and she smiled tenderly, "always know
1|how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it
1|may be for me. I am used to suffering."
1|
1|Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he
1|had done at Anna Pavlovna's, that it would be difficult to get rid
1|of Anna Mikhaylovna.
1|
1|"Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna
1|Mikhaylovna?" said he. "Let us wait until evening. The doctors are
1|expecting a crisis."
1|
1|"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the
1|welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a
1|Christian..."
1|
1|A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses,
1|the count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of
1|her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince
1|Vasili turned to her.
1|
1|"Well, how is he?"
1|
1|"Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise..." said the
1|princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy
1|smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece. "I have come, and am
1|at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have
1|gone through," and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.
1|
1|The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room
1|as Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position
1|she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasili
1|to take a seat beside her.
1|
1|"Boris," she said to her son with a smile, "I shall go in to see the
1|count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile
1|and don't forget to give him the Rostovs' invitation. They ask him
1|to dinner. I suppose he won't go?" she continued, turning to the
1|prince.
1|
1|"On the contrary," replied the prince, who had plainly become
1|depressed, "I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young
1|man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him."
1|
1|He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Boris down one flight
1|of stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
1|Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
1|sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostov's was true.
1|Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been
1|for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father's
1|house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be
1|already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father--who were
1|never favorably disposed toward him--would have used it to turn the
1|count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to
1|his father's part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the
1|princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of
1|whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It
1|was the eldest who was reading--the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna.
1|The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and
1|they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made
1|her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a
1|leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared
1|at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same
1|expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a
1|cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile
1|probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool
1|down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing,
1|stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.
1|
1|"How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre. "You don't recognize me?"
1|
1|"I recognize you only too well, too well."
1|
1|"How is the count? Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,
1|but unabashed.
1|
1|"The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently
1|you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings."
1|
1|"Can I see the count?" Pierre again asked.
1|
1|"Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
1|him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready--it is
1|almost time," she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were
1|busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,
1|Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.
1|
1|Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed
1|and said: "Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can
1|see him."
1|
1|And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of
1|the sister with the mole.
1|
1|Next day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count's house.
1|He sent for Pierre and said to him: "My dear fellow, if you are
1|going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very
1|badly; that is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very
1|ill, and you must not see him at all."
1|
1|Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole
1|time in his rooms upstairs.
1|
1|When Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his
1|room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at
1|the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and
1|glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his
1|walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and
1|gesticulating.
1|
1|"England is done for," said he, scowling and pointing his finger
1|at someone unseen. "Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the
1|rights of man, is sentenced to..." But before Pierre--who at that
1|moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just
1|effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured
1|London--could pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a well-built and
1|handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left
1|Moscow when Boris was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten
1|him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Boris by the
1|hand with a friendly smile.
1|
1|"Do you remember me?" asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile.
1|"I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not
1|well."
1|
1|"Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,"
1|answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.
1|
1|Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it
1|necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least
1|embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.
1|
1|"Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today," said he, after a
1|considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.
1|
1|"Ah, Count Rostov!" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. "Then you are his
1|son, Ilya? Only fancy, I didn't know you at first. Do you remember how
1|we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It's such an
1|age..."
1|
1|"You are mistaken," said Boris deliberately, with a bold and
1|slightly sarcastic smile. "I am Boris, son of Princess Anna
1|Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya. Rostov, the father, is Ilya, and his son is
1|Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot."
1|
1|Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
1|
1|"Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything up. One
1|has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of course. Well,
1|now we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne
1|expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon
1|gets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible.
1|If only Villeneuve doesn't make a mess of things!"
1|
1|Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read
1|the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve's name.
1|
1|"We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
1|than with politics," said he in his quiet ironical tone. "I know
1|nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy
1|with gossip," he continued. "Just now they are talking about you and
1|your father."
1|
1|Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his
1|companion's sake that the latter might say something he would
1|afterwards regret. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly,
1|looking straight into Pierre's eyes.
1|
1|"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," Boris went on.
1|"Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,
1|though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will..."
1|
1|"Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted Pierre, "very horrid."
1|
1|Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
1|something disconcerting to himself.
1|
1|"And it must seem to you," said Boris flushing slightly, but not
1|changing his tone or attitude, "it must seem to you that everyone is
1|trying to get something out of the rich man?"
1|
1|"So it does," thought Pierre.
1|
1|"But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are
1|quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are
1|very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that
1|your father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and
1|neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him."
1|
1|For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he
1|jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his quick,
1|clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to speak with a
1|feeling of mingled shame and vexation.
1|
1|"Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I
1|know very well..."
1|
1|But Boris again interrupted him.
1|
1|"I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You
1|must excuse me," said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being
1|put at ease by him, "but I hope I have not offended you. I always make
1|it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you
1|come to dinner at the Rostovs'?"
1|
1|And Boris, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
1|extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,
1|became quite pleasant again.
1|
1|"No, but I say," said Pierre, calming down, "you are a wonderful
1|fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you
1|don't know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we
1|were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite
1|understand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the
1|courage, but it's splendid. I am very glad to have made your
1|acquaintance. It's queer," he added after a pause, "that you should
1|have suspected me!" He began to laugh. "Well, what of it! I hope we'll
1|get better acquainted," and he pressed Boris' hand. "Do you know, I
1|have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I
1|am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?"
1|
1|"And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?" asked
1|Boris with a smile.
1|
1|Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject, and being of the
1|same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of
1|the Boulogne expedition.
1|
1|A footman came in to summon Boris--the princess was going. Pierre,
1|in order to make Boris' better acquaintance, promised to come to
1|dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his
1|spectacles into Boris' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing
1|up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an
1|imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance
1|of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.
1|
1|As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a
1|lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man
1|and made up his mind that they would be friends.
1|
1|Prince Vasili saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her
1|eyes and her face was tearful.
1|
1|"It is dreadful, dreadful!" she was saying, "but cost me what it may
1|I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be
1|left like this. Every moment is precious. I can't think why his nieces
1|put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare
1|him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you..."
1|
1|"Adieu, ma bonne," answered Prince Vasili turning away from her.
1|
1|"Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mother to her son when
1|they were in the carriage. "He hardly recognizes anybody."
1|
1|"I don't understand, Mamma--what is his attitude to Pierre?" asked
1|the son.
1|
1|"The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it."
1|
1|"But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?"
1|
1|"Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!"
1|
1|"Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma..."
1|
1|"Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!" exclaimed the mother.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count
1|Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov, Countess Rostova sat for a long time all
1|alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.
1|
1|"What is the matter with you, my dear?" she said crossly to the maid
1|who kept her waiting some minutes. "Don't you wish to serve me? Then
1|I'll find you another place."
1|
1|The countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating
1|poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with
1|her always found expression in calling her maid "my dear" and speaking
1|to her with exaggerated politeness.
1|
1|"I am very sorry, ma'am," answered the maid.
1|
1|"Ask the count to come to me."
1|
1|The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look
1|as usual.
1|
1|"Well, little countess? What a saute of game au madere we are to
1|have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Taras
1|were not ill-spent. He is worth it!"
1|
1|He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands
1|ruffling his gray hair.
1|
1|"What are your commands, little countess?"
1|
1|"You see, my dear... What's that mess?" she said, pointing to his
1|waistcoat. "It's the saute, most likely," she added with a smile.
1|"Well, you see, Count, I want some money."
1|
1|Her face became sad.
1|
1|"Oh, little countess!"... and the count began bustling to get out
1|his pocketbook.
1|
1|"I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles," and taking
1|out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's waistcoat.
1|
1|"Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's there?" he called out
1|in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call
1|will rush to obey the summons. "Send Dmitri to me!"
1|
1|Dmitri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the
1|count's house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the
1|room.
1|
1|"This is what I want, my dear fellow," said the count to the
1|deferential young man who had entered. "Bring me..." he reflected a
1|moment, "yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don't
1|bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean
1|ones for the countess."
1|
1|"Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please," said the countess, sighing
1|deeply.
1|
1|"When would you like them, your excellency?" asked Dmitri. "Allow me
1|to inform you... But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing that the
1|count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always
1|a sign of approaching anger. "I was forgetting... Do you wish it
1|brought at once?"
1|
1|"Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess."
1|
1|"What a treasure that Dmitri is," added the count with a smile
1|when the young man had departed. "There is never any 'impossible'
1|with him. That's a thing I hate! Everything is possible."
1|
1|"Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,"
1|said the countess. "But I am in great need of this sum."
1|
1|"You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift," said the
1|count, and having kissed his wife's hand he went back to his study.
1|
1|When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov's the money,
1|all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the
1|countess' little table, and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something
1|was agitating her.
1|
1|"Well, my dear?" asked the countess.
1|
1|"Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is
1|so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word..."
1|
1|"Annette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me," the countess began,
1|with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,
1|elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be
1|ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.
1|
1|"This is for Boris from me, for his outfit."
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess
1|wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were
1|kindhearted, and because they--friends from childhood--had to think
1|about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....
1|But those tears were pleasant to them both.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|Countess Rostova, with her daughters and a large number of guests,
1|was already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen
1|into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes.
1|From time to time he went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet?" They were
1|expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, known in society as le
1|terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but
1|for common sense and frank plainness of speech. Marya Dmitrievna was
1|known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and
1|Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at
1|her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less
1|all without exception respected and feared her.
1|
1|In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of
1|war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the
1|recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew
1|it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were
1|smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his
1|head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers
1|with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two
1|neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.
1|
1|One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and
1|wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a
1|most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as
1|if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his
1|mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his
1|eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a
1|man with "a sharp tongue" as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to
1|be condescending to his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer
1|of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held
1|his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled
1|the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This
1|was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom
1|Boris was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natasha had,
1|teased her elder sister Vera, speaking of Berg as her "intended."
1|The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite
1|occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of,
1|was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two
1|loquacious talkers at one another.
1|
1|"Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich,"
1|said Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary
1|Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases--which was a
1|peculiarity of his speech. "Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur
1|l'etat;* you want to make something out of your company?"
1|
1|
1|*You expect to make an income out of the government.
1|
1|
1|"No, Peter Nikolaevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry
1|the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own
1|position now, Peter Nikolaevich..."
1|
1|Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His
1|conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain
1|calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no
1|direct bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without
1|being at all put out of countenance himself or making others
1|uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he
1|would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.
1|
1|"Consider my position, Peter Nikolaevich. Were I in the cavalry I
1|should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even
1|with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and
1|thirty," said he, looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful,
1|pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must
1|always be the chief desire of everyone else.
1|
1|"Besides that, Peter Nikolaevich, by exchanging into the Guards I
1|shall be in a more prominent position," continued Berg, "and vacancies
1|occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what
1|can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a
1|little aside and to send something to my father," he went on, emitting
1|a smoke ring.
1|
1|"La balance y est...* A German knows how to skin a flint, as the
1|proverb says," remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the other side of
1|his mouth and winking at the count.
1|
1|
1|*So that squares matters.
1|
1|
1|The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that
1|Shinshin was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or
1|indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards
1|he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps;
1|how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as
1|senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular
1|he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was
1|with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not
1|seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests.
1|But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naivete of his
1|youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.
1|
1|"Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go--foot or horse--that
1|I'll warrant," said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking
1|his feet off the sofa.
1|
1|Berg smiled joyously. The count, by his guests, went into the
1|drawing room.
1|
1|It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled
1|guests, expecting the summons to zakuska,* avoid engaging in any
1|long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in
1|order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The
1|host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at
1|one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who,
1|or what, they are waiting for--some important relation who has not yet
1|arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.
1|
1|
1|*Hors d'oeuvres.
1|
1|
1|Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in
1|the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come
1|across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make
1|him talk, but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles
1|as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in
1|monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not
1|notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the
1|bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering
1|how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a
1|policeman.
1|
1|"You have only lately arrived?" the countess asked him.
1|
1|"Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.
1|
1|"You have not yet seen my husband?"
1|
1|"Non, madame." He smiled quite inappropriately.
1|
1|"You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very
1|interesting."
1|
1|"Very interesting."
1|
1|The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna. The latter
1|understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and
1|sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he
1|answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other
1|guests were all conversing with one another. "The Razumovskis... It
1|was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apraksina..." was
1|heard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
1|
1|"Marya Dmitrievna?" came her voice from there.
1|
1|"Herself," came the answer in a rough voice, and Marya Dmitrievna
1|entered the room.
1|
1|All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
1|oldest rose. Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,
1|holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood
1|surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
1|rolling them up. Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.
1|
1|"Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to
1|her children," she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned
1|all others. "Well, you old sinner," she went on, turning to the
1|count who was kissing her hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I
1|daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old
1|man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up," and she pointed
1|to the girls. "You must look for husbands for them whether you like it
1|or not...."
1|
1|"Well," said she, "how's my Cossack?" (Marya Dmitrievna always called
1|Natasha a Cossack) and she stroked the child's arm as she came up
1|fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I know she's a scamp of a girl,
1|but I like her."
1|
1|She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge
1|reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with
1|the pleasure of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once and
1|addressed herself to Pierre.
1|
1|"Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit," said she, assuming a soft high
1|tone of voice. "Come here, my friend..." and she ominously tucked up
1|her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a
1|childlike way through his spectacles.
1|
1|"Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell
1|your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it's my
1|evident duty." She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to
1|follow, for this was dearly only a prelude.
1|
1|"A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed
1|and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,
1|sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war."
1|
1|She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly
1|keep from laughing.
1|
1|"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" said Marya
1|Dmitrievna.
1|
1|The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess followed
1|on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them
1|because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna
1|Mikhaylovna with Shinshin. Berg gave his arm to Vera. The smiling
1|Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples
1|followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children,
1|tutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen began moving
1|about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the
1|guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count's
1|household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the
1|voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of
1|the table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna
1|Mikhaylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At
1|the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and
1|Shinshin and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the
1|long table on one side sat the grownup young people: Vera beside Berg,
1|and Pierre beside Boris; and on the other side, the children,
1|tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit
1|vases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its
1|light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors' glasses, not
1|neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her
1|duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the
1|pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their
1|redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies'
1|end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men's end
1|the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel
1|of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much
1|that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with
1|tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a
1|heavenly feeling. Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the
1|guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting
1|opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a
1|great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and
1|went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the
1|wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in
1|a napkin, from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered: "Dry
1|Madeira"... "Hungarian"... or "Rhine wine" as the case might be. Of
1|the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's monogram that stood
1|before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with
1|enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests.
1|Natasha, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen
1|look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the
1|first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny
1|lively little girl's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing
1|why.
1|
1|Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina,
1|to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sonya
1|wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now
1|she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what
1|Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept
1|looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might
1|be put upon the children. The German tutor was trying to remember
1|all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full
1|description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt
1|greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin
1|passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want
1|any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand
1|that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted
1|it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more
1|animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had
1|already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself
1|seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in
1|chief.
1|
1|"And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?" remarked
1|Shinshin. "He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be our
1|turn next."
1|
1|The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted
1|to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshin's
1|remark.
1|
1|"It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a
1|German accent, "for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He
1|declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze
1|danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as
1|vell as ze sanctity of its alliances..." he spoke this last word
1|with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.
1|
1|Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
1|repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:
1|
1|... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and
1|absolute aim--to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations--has
1|now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a
1|new condition for the attainment of that purpose.
1|
1|"Zat, my dear sir, is vy..." he concluded, drinking a tumbler of
1|wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.
1|
1|"Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* 'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but
1|turn spindles at home!'?" said Shinshin, puckering his brows and
1|smiling. "Cela nous convient a merveille.*[2] Suvorov now--he knew
1|what he was about; yet they beat him a plate couture,*[3] and where
1|are we to find Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,"*[4] said he,
1|continually changing from French to Russian.
1|
1|
1|*Do you know the proverb?
1|
1|*[2] That suits us down to the ground.
1|
1|*[3] Hollow.
1|
1|*[4] I just ask you that.
1|
1|
1|"Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!" said the
1|colonel, thumping the table; "and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen
1|all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible"...
1|he dwelt particularly on the word possible... "as po-o-ossible," he
1|ended, again turning to the count. "Zat is how ve old hussars look
1|at it, and zere's an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a
1|young hussar, how do you judge of it?" he added, addressing
1|Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had
1|turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.
1|
1|"I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicholas, flaming up,
1|turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as
1|much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment
1|facing some great danger. "I am convinced that we Russians must die or
1|conquer," he concluded, conscious--as were others--after the words
1|were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for
1|the occasion and were therefore awkward.
1|
1|"What you said just now was splendid!" said his partner Julie.
1|
1|Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them
1|and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.
1|
1|Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly.
1|
1|"That's fine," said he.
1|
1|"The young man's a real hussar!" shouted the colonel, again thumping
1|the table.
1|
1|"What are you making such a noise about over there?" Marya
1|Dmitrievna's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the
1|table. "What are you thumping the table for?" she demanded of the
1|hussar, "and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French
1|are here?"
1|
1|"I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.
1|
1|"It's all about the war," the count shouted down the table. "You
1|know my son's going, Marya Dmitrievna? My son is going."
1|
1|"I have four sons in the army but still I don't fret. It is all in
1|God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a
1|battle," replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice, which easily carried
1|the whole length of the table.
1|
1|"That's true!"
1|
1|Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies' at the one end
1|and the men's at the other.
1|
1|"You won't ask," Natasha's little brother was saying; "I know you
1|won't ask!"
1|
1|"I will," replied Natasha.
1|
1|Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She
1|half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to
1|what was coming, and turning to her mother:
1|
1|"Mamma!" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
1|audible the whole length of the table.
1|
1|"What is it?" asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her
1|daughter's face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her
1|sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.
1|
1|The conversation was hushed.
1|
1|"Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" and Natasha's voice
1|sounded still more firm and resolute.
1|
1|The countess tried to frown, but could not. Marya Dmitrievna shook
1|her fat finger.
1|
1|"Cossack!" she said threateningly.
1|
1|Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at
1|the elders.
1|
1|"You had better take care!" said the countess.
1|
1|"Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" Natasha again cried
1|boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken
1|in good part.
1|
1|Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter.
1|
1|"You see! I have asked," whispered Natasha to her little brother and
1|to Pierre, glancing at him again.
1|
1|"Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Marya Dmitrievna.
1|
1|Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
1|Marya Dmitrievna.
1|
1|"Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't like ice
1|cream."
1|
1|"Carrot ices."
1|
1|"No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna? What kind?" she almost screamed;
1|"I want to know!"
1|
1|Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the
1|guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna's answer
1|but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who
1|had dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion.
1|
1|Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
1|pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band
1|again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests,
1|leaving their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and
1|reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the
1|children, and with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs
1|scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with
1|redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the
1|count's study.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the
1|count's visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,
1|some in the sitting room, some in the library.
1|
1|The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty
1|from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at
1|everything. The young people, at the countess' instigation, gathered
1|round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played
1|first. After she had played a little air with variations on the
1|harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natasha and
1|Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing
1|something. Natasha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was
1|evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.
1|
1|"What shall we sing?" she said.
1|
1|"'The Brook,'" suggested Nicholas.
1|
1|"Well, then, let's be quick. Boris, come here," said Natasha. "But
1|where is Sonya?"
1|
1|She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room
1|ran to look for her.
1|
1|Running into Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha ran
1|to the nursery, but Sonya was not there either. Natasha concluded that
1|she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage
1|was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the
1|Rostov household. And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on
1|Nurse's dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy
1|pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and
1|sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook.
1|Natasha's face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint's
1|day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed
1|down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.
1|
1|"Sonya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!" And
1|Natasha's large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she
1|began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sonya was
1|crying. Sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and
1|hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natasha wept, sitting on the
1|blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort
1|Sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.
1|
1|"Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his... papers... have
1|come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry," and she
1|showed a paper she held in her hand--with the verses Nicholas had
1|written, "still, I should not cry, but you can't... no one can
1|understand... what a soul he has!"
1|
1|And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.
1|
1|"It's all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and
1|Boris also," she went on, gaining a little strength; "he is nice...
1|there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...
1|one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it
1|can't be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma" (Sonya looked upon the
1|countess as her mother and called her so) "that I am spoiling
1|Nicholas' career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God
1|is my witness," and she made the sign of the cross, "I love her so
1|much, and all of you, only Vera... And what for? What have I done to
1|her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice
1|everything, only I have nothing...."
1|
1|Sonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in
1|the feather bed. Natasha began consoling her, but her face showed that
1|she understood all the gravity of her friend's trouble.
1|
1|"Sonya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true
1|reason of her friend's sorrow, "I'm sure Vera has said something to
1|you since dinner? Hasn't she?"
1|
1|"Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some
1|others, and she found them on my table and said she'd show them to
1|Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him
1|to marry me, but that he'll marry Julie. You see how he's been with
1|her all day... Natasha, what have I done to deserve it?..."
1|
1|And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natasha
1|lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began
1|comforting her.
1|
1|"Sonya, don't believe her, darling! Don't believe her! Do you
1|remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting
1|room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don't
1|quite remember how, but don't you remember that it could all be
1|arranged and how nice it all was? There's Uncle Shinshin's brother has
1|married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.
1|And Boris says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all
1|about it. And he is so clever and so good!" said Natasha. "Don't you
1|cry, Sonya, dear love, darling Sonya!" and she kissed her and laughed.
1|"Vera's spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she
1|won't say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he
1|doesn't care at all for Julie."
1|
1|Natasha kissed her on the hair.
1|
1|Sonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
1|seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
1|playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
1|
1|"Do you think so?... Really? Truly?" she said, quickly smoothing her
1|frock and hair.
1|
1|"Really, truly!" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp lock that
1|had strayed from under her friend's plaits.
1|
1|Both laughed.
1|
1|"Well, let's go and sing 'The Brook.'"
1|
1|"Come along!"
1|
1|"Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!" said
1|Natasha, stopping suddenly. "I feel so happy!"
1|
1|And she set off at a run along the passage.
1|
1|Sonya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
1|verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran
1|after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
1|and light, joyous steps. At the visitors' request the young people
1|sang the quartette, "The Brook," with which everyone was delighted.
1|Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:
1|
1|
1|   At nighttime in the moon's fair glow
1|     How sweet, as fancies wander free,
1|   To feel that in this world there's one
1|     Who still is thinking but of thee!
1|
1|   That while her fingers touch the harp
1|     Wafting sweet music o'er the lea,
1|   It is for thee thus swells her heart,
1|     Sighing its message out to thee...
1|
1|   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,
1|     But oh! till then I cannot live!...
1|
1|
1|He had not finished the last verse before the young people began
1|to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and
1|the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.
1|
1|
1|Pierre was sitting in the drawing-room where Shinshin had engaged
1|him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political
1|conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre.
1|When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre
1|said, laughing and blushing:
1|
1|"Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers."
1|
1|"I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre replied; "but if you
1|will be my teacher..." And lowering his big arm he offered it to the
1|slender little girl.
1|
1|While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning
1|up, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly
1|happy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She
1|was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a
1|grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had
1|given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman
1|(heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her
1|partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.
1|
1|"Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as she
1|crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.
1|
1|Natasha blushed and laughed.
1|
1|"Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be
1|surprised at?"
1|
1|
1|In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs
1|being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya
1|Dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more
1|distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves
1|after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks,
1|entered the ballroom. First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count,
1|both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony
1|somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrievna. He
1|drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and
1|as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped
1|his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing
1|the first violin:
1|
1|"Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"
1|
1|This was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in his
1|youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the
1|anglaise.)
1|
1|"Look at Papa!" shouted Natasha to the whole company, and quite
1|forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
1|curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her
1|laughter.
1|
1|And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure
1|at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout
1|partner, Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened
1|his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot,
1|and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more,
1|prepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the
1|provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling
1|those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of
1|the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs--the men on
1|one side and the women on the other--who with beaming faces had come
1|to see their master making merry.
1|
1|"Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!" loudly remarked
1|the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.
1|
1|The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did
1|not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her
1|powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the
1|countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the
1|dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count's plump figure, in
1|Marya Dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming
1|face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more
1|into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness
1|of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on
1|his light feet, Marya Dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight
1|exertions--the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms
1|when turning, or stamp her foot--which everyone appreciated in view of
1|her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and
1|livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment's attention
1|to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were
1|watching the count and Marya Dmitrievna. Natasha kept pulling everyone
1|by sleeve or dress, urging them to "look at Papa!" though as it was
1|they never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the
1|dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the
1|musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more
1|lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Marya
1|Dmitrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his
1|partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft
1|foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a
1|wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led
1|by Natasha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping
1|their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.
1|
1|"That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chere," said the count.
1|
1|"That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, tucking up
1|her sleeves and puffing heavily.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|While in the Rostovs' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being
1|danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while
1|tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezukhov had
1|a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a
1|mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man,
1|preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there
1|was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside
1|the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid
1|whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important
1|order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who
1|had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the
1|count's health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to
1|the celebrated grandee of Catherine's court, Count Bezukhov.
1|
1|The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
1|respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
1|hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging
1|their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the
1|glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the
1|family. Prince Vasili, who had grown thinner and paler during the last
1|few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several
1|times in low tones.
1|
1|When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasili sat down all
1|alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the
1|other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his
1|hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him
1|with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the
1|long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the
1|eldest princess.
1|
1|Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
1|whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying
1|man's room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or
1|expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.
1|
1|"The limits of human life... are fixed and may not be o'erpassed,"
1|said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
1|listening naively to his words.
1|
1|"I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?" asked the
1|lady, adding the priest's clerical title, as if she had no opinion
1|of her own on the subject.
1|
1|"Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament," replied the priest, passing
1|his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his
1|bald head.
1|
1|"Who was that? The Military Governor himself?" was being asked at
1|the other side of the room. "How young-looking he is!"
1|
1|"Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes
1|anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction."
1|
1|"I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times."
1|
1|The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes
1|red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
1|graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a
1|table.
1|
1|"Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a remark about the
1|weather. "The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow
1|one feels as if one were in the country."
1|
1|"Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sigh. "So he may have
1|something to drink?"
1|
1|Lorrain considered.
1|
1|"Has he taken his medicine?"
1|
1|"Yes."
1|
1|The doctor glanced at his watch.
1|
1|"Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,"
1|and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.
1|
1|"Dere has neffer been a gase," a German doctor was saying to an
1|aide-de-camp, "dat one liffs after de sird stroke."
1|
1|"And what a well-preserved man he was!" remarked the aide-de-camp.
1|"And who will inherit his wealth?" he added in a whisper.
1|
1|"It von't go begging," replied the German with a smile.
1|
1|Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second
1|princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to
1|Lorrain's instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
1|
1|"Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the German,
1|addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
1|
1|Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger
1|before his nose.
1|
1|"Tonight, not later," said he in a low voice, and he moved away with
1|a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to
1|understand and state the patient's condition.
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess' room.
1|
1|In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning
1|before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt
1|pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture,
1|whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white
1|feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to
1|bark.
1|
1|"Ah, is it you, cousin?"
1|
1|She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely
1|smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and
1|covered with varnish.
1|
1|"Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am so terrified."
1|
1|"No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about
1|business, Catiche,"* muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on
1|the chair she had just vacated. "You have made the place warm, I
1|must say," he remarked. "Well, sit down: let's have a talk."
1|
1|
1|*Catherine.
1|
1|
1|"I thought perhaps something had happened," she said with her
1|unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the
1|prince, she prepared to listen.
1|
1|"I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't."
1|
1|"Well, my dear?" said Prince Vasili, taking her hand and bending
1|it downwards as was his habit.
1|
1|It was plain that this "well?" referred to much that they both
1|understood without naming.
1|
1|The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for
1|her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasili with no sign of emotion
1|in her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up
1|at the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an
1|expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting
1|before long. Prince Vasili understood it as an expression of
1|weariness.
1|
1|"And I?" he said; "do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn
1|out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a
1|very serious talk."
1|
1|Prince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,
1|now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant
1|expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His
1|eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly
1|and at the next glanced round in alarm.
1|
1|The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
1|hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasili's eyes evidently resolved
1|not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.
1|
1|"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semenovna,"
1|continued Prince Vasili, returning to his theme, apparently not
1|without an inner struggle; "at such a moment as this one must think of
1|everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love
1|you all, like children of my own, as you know."
1|
1|The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the
1|same dull expression.
1|
1|"And then of course my family has also to be considered," Prince
1|Vasili went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at
1|her. "You know, Catiche, that we--you three sisters, Mamontov, and
1|my wife--are the count's only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it
1|is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me;
1|but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for
1|anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count," pointing
1|to his portrait, "definitely demanded that he should be called."
1|
1|Prince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess, but could not
1|make out whether she was considering what he had just said or
1|whether she was simply looking at him.
1|
1|"There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin," she
1|replied, "and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow
1|his noble soul peacefully to leave this..."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently,
1|rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
1|table that he had pushed away. "But... in short, the fact is... you
1|know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he
1|left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre."
1|
1|"He has made wills enough!" quietly remarked the princess. "But he
1|cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate."
1|
1|"But, my dear," said Prince Vasili suddenly, clutching the little
1|table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: "what if
1|a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for
1|Pierre's legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of
1|the count's services, his request would be granted?..."
1|
1|The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about
1|the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.
1|
1|"I can tell you more," continued Prince Vasili, seizing her hand,
1|"that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew
1|of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not,
1|then as soon as all is over," and Prince Vasili sighed to intimate
1|what he meant by the words all is over, "and the count's papers are
1|opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and
1|the petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything
1|as the legitimate son."
1|
1|"And our share?" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if
1|anything might happen, only not that.
1|
1|"But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be
1|the legal heir to everything and you won't get anything. You must
1|know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether
1|they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been
1|overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them,
1|because..."
1|
1|"What next?" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and
1|not changing the expression of her eyes. "I am a woman, and you
1|think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot
1|inherit... un batard!"* she added, as if supposing that this
1|translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasili the
1|invalidity of his contention.
1|
1|
1|*A bastard.
1|
1|
1|"Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand! You are so
1|intelligent, how is it you don't see that if the count has written a
1|letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate,
1|it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count
1|Bezukhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if
1|the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing
1|but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit!*
1|That's certain."
1|
1|
1|*And all that follows therefrom.
1|
1|
1|"I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and
1|you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool," said the
1|princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are
1|saying something witty and stinging.
1|
1|"My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna," began Prince Vasili
1|impatiently, "I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about
1|your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I
1|tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and
1|the will in Pierre's favor are among the count's papers, then, my dear
1|girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don't believe me,
1|then believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich"
1|(the family solicitor) "and he says the same."
1|
1|At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess' ideas;
1|her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her
1|voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she
1|herself evidently did not expect.
1|
1|"That would be a fine thing!" said she. "I never wanted anything and
1|I don't now."
1|
1|She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.
1|
1|"And this is gratitude--this is recognition for those who have
1|sacrificed everything for his sake!" she cried. "It's splendid!
1|Fine! I don't want anything, Prince."
1|
1|"Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters..."
1|replied Prince Vasili.
1|
1|But the princess did not listen to him.
1|
1|"Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could
1|expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and
1|ingratitude--the blackest ingratitude--in this house..."
1|
1|"Do you or do you not know where that will is?" insisted Prince
1|Vasili, his cheeks twitching more than ever.
1|
1|"Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and
1|sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has
1|been intriguing!"
1|
1|The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand.
1|She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole
1|human race. She gave her companion an angry glance.
1|
1|"There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it
1|was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was
1|afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to
1|ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and
1|not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who..."
1|
1|"Who sacrificed everything for him," chimed in the princess, who
1|would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, "though
1|he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin," she added with a
1|sigh, "I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no
1|reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this
1|world one has to be cunning and cruel."
1|
1|"Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart."
1|
1|"No, I have a wicked heart."
1|
1|"I know your heart," repeated the prince. "I value your friendship
1|and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don't upset yourself,
1|and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or
1|be it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above
1|all where it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to
1|the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.
1|You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
1|wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help
1|him and you."
1|
1|"Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing--I know!" cried
1|the princess.
1|
1|"That's not the point, my dear."
1|
1|"It's that protege of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskaya, that
1|Anna Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the
1|infamous, vile woman!"
1|
1|"Do not let us lose any time..."
1|
1|"Ah, don't talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here
1|and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us,
1|especially about Sophie--I can't repeat them--that it made the count
1|quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was
1|then he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was
1|invalid."
1|
1|"We've got to it at last--why did you not tell me about it sooner?"
1|
1|"It's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,"
1|said the princess, ignoring his question. "Now I know! Yes; if I
1|have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!" almost
1|shrieked the princess, now quite changed. "And what does she come
1|worming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind.
1|The time will come!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|While these conversations were going on in the reception room and
1|the princess' room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent
1|for) and Anna Mikhaylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him)
1|was driving into the court of Count Bezukhov's house. As the wheels
1|rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikhaylovna,
1|having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he
1|was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre
1|followed Anna Mikhaylovna out of the carriage, and only then began
1|to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him.
1|He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the
1|back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two
1|men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and
1|hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed
1|several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house
1|on both sides. But neither Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the
1|coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of
1|them. "It seems to be all right," Pierre concluded, and followed
1|Anna Mikhaylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone
1|staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow.
1|Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the
1|count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet
1|judging by Anna Mikhaylovna's air of assurance and haste, Pierre
1|concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the
1|stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying
1|pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men
1|pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass
1|and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.
1|
1|"Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?" asked Anna
1|Mikhaylovna of one of them.
1|
1|"Yes," replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were
1|now permissible; "the door to the left, ma'am."
1|
1|"Perhaps the count did not ask for me," said Pierre when he
1|reached the landing. "I'd better go to my own room."
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up.
1|
1|"Ah, my friend!" she said, touching his arm as she had done her
1|son's when speaking to him that afternoon, "believe me I suffer no
1|less than you do, but be a man!"
1|
1|"But really, hadn't I better go away?" he asked, looking kindly at
1|her over his spectacles.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done
1|you. Think that he is your father... perhaps in the agony of death."
1|She sighed. "I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust
1|yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests."
1|
1|Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this
1|had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylovna who
1|was already opening a door.
1|
1|This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the
1|princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been
1|in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
1|these rooms. Anna Mikhaylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past
1|with a decanter on a tray as "my dear" and "my sweet," asked about the
1|princess' health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The
1|first door on the left led into the princesses' apartments. The maid
1|with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything
1|in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna
1|Mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where
1|Prince Vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together
1|talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasili drew back with obvious
1|impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of
1|desperation slammed the door with all her might.
1|
1|This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear
1|depicted on Prince Vasili's face so out of keeping with his dignity
1|that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his
1|guide. Anna Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly
1|and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.
1|
1|"Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests," said she in
1|reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.
1|
1|Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what
1|"watching over his interests" meant, but he decided that all these
1|things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit
1|room adjoining the count's reception room. It was one of those
1|sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front
1|approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and
1|water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a
1|censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them.
1|They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian
1|windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full
1|length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still
1|sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one
1|another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn
1|Anna Mikhaylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre
1|who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna's face expressed a consciousness that the
1|decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg
1|lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even
1|more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her
1|the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured.
1|Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the
1|count's confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble,
1|not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and
1|respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another
1|priest.
1|
1|"God be thanked that you are in time," said she to one of the
1|priests; "all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man
1|is the count's son," she added more softly. "What a terrible moment!"
1|
1|Having said this she went up to the doctor.
1|
1|"Dear doctor," said she, "this young man is the count's son. Is
1|there any hope?"
1|
1|The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
1|shoulders. Anna Mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her
1|shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved
1|away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful
1|and tenderly sad voice, she said:
1|
1|"Trust in His mercy!" and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
1|and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone
1|was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind
1|it.
1|
1|Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly,
1|moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna
1|had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned
1|to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed
1|that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him
1|with a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had
1|never before received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had
1|been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an
1|aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the
1|doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to
1|make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as
1|not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and
1|to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at
1|once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a
1|person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone
1|expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their
1|services. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and
1|sat down in the lady's chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically
1|on his knees in the naive attitude of an Egyptian statue, and
1|decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in
1|order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on
1|his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the
1|will of those who were guiding him.
1|
1|Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasili with head erect
1|majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three
1|stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the
1|morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and
1|noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never
1|used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain
1|whether it was firmly fixed on.
1|
1|"Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is
1|well!" and he turned to go.
1|
1|But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: "How is..." and hesitated,
1|not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man "the
1|count," yet ashamed to call him "father."
1|
1|"He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my
1|friend..."
1|
1|Pierre's mind was in such a confused state that the word "stroke"
1|suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasili
1|in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
1|illness. Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went
1|through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
1|whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him,
1|and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the
1|door. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about,
1|and at last Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the same expression, pale but
1|resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly
1|on the arm said:
1|
1|"The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be
1|administered. Come."
1|
1|Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed
1|that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all
1|followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission
1|to enter that room.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIII
1|
1|
1|Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its
1|walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the
1|columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side
1|and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly
1|illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening
1|service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in
1|that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed,
1|Pierre saw--covered to the waist by a bright green quilt--the
1|familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezukhov, with that
1|gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a
1|lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his
1|handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick
1|hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm
1|downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb,
1|and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in
1|position. By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over
1|their magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their
1|hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little behind
1|them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their
1|eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a
1|vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though
1|declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she
1|glance round. Anna Mikhaylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and
1|all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the
1|strange lady. Prince Vasili in front of the door, near the invalid
1|chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the
1|carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and
1|was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each
1|time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and
1|resignation to the will of God. "If you do not understand these
1|sentiments," he seemed to be saying, "so much the worse for you!"
1|
1|Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;
1|the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently
1|crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the
1|subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and
1|the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna
1|Mikhaylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she
1|quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre
1|was standing and gave him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by
1|observing those around him, began crossing himself with the hand
1|that held the taper.
1|
1|Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the
1|mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and
1|remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing
1|Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look
1|at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be
1|out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In
1|the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased,
1|they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the
1|count's hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovna
1|stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to
1|Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he
1|was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude
1|implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith,
1|understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and
1|even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless
1|step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers
1|raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning
1|sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given
1|something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people
1|resumed their places and the service continued. During this interval
1|Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had
1|been leaning, and--with an air which intimated that he knew what he was
1|about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse
1|for them--did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined
1|the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room
1|where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the
1|bed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door, but
1|returned to their places one after the other before the service was
1|concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to
1|the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that
1|what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way
1|essential.
1|
1|The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest
1|was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received
1|the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as
1|before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and
1|whispers, among which Anna Mikhaylovna's was the most distinct.
1|
1|Pierre heard her say:
1|
1|"Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be
1|impossible..."
1|
1|The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and
1|servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face
1|with its gray mane--which, though he saw other faces as well, he had
1|not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He
1|judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the
1|invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.
1|
1|"Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!" he heard one of the
1|servants say in a frightened whisper. "Catch hold from underneath.
1|Here!" exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the
1|bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the
1|weight they were carrying were too much for them.
1|
1|As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, passed the young
1|man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the
1|dying man's high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders,
1|raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his
1|gray, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow
1|and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic
1|expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the
1|same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had
1|sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly
1|with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze
1|fixed itself upon nothing.
1|
1|After a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead, those who
1|had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhaylovna touched
1|Pierre's hand and said, "Come." Pierre went with her to the bed on
1|which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the
1|ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the
1|pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk
1|quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing
1|straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not
1|be understood by mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that
1|as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too
1|much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced
1|inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with
1|her eyes, glancing at the sick man's hand and moving her lips as if to
1|send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to
1|touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the
1|large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of
1|the count's face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at
1|Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikhaylovna
1|with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre
1|obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna
1|Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naively
1|symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that
1|his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to
1|look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed
1|at the spot where Pierre's face had been before he sat down. Anna
1|Mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the
1|pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the
1|father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre
1|seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count's
1|face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth
1|was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death
1|his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct,
1|hoarse sound. Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick man's
1|eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre,
1|then to some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an inquiring
1|whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick
1|man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who
1|stood constantly at the head of the bed.
1|
1|"Wants to turn on the other side," whispered the servant, and got up
1|to turn the count's heavy body toward the wall.
1|
1|Pierre rose to help him.
1|
1|While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back
1|helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward.
1|Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded
1|that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his
1|dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's
1|terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a
1|feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his
1|features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight of this
1|smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling
1|in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on
1|to his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.
1|
1|"He is dozing," said Anna Mikhaylovna, observing that one of the
1|princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. "Let us go."
1|
1|Pierre went out.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIV
1|
1|
1|There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasili
1|and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of
1|Catherine the Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre
1|and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the
1|princess hide something as she whispered:
1|
1|"I can't bear the sight of that woman."
1|
1|"Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room," said
1|Prince Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna. "Go and take something, my poor
1|Anna Mikhaylovna, or you will not hold out."
1|
1|To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic
1|squeeze below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the
1|small drawing room.
1|
1|"There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup
1|of this delicious Russian tea," Lorrain was saying with an air of
1|restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese
1|handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid
1|in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count
1|Bezukhov's house that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre
1|well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
1|and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not
1|know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the
1|ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds
1|and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the
1|brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several
1|times. Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one
1|small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the
1|middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not
1|merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word
1|and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what
1|was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though
1|he would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his
1|monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the
1|reception room where they had left Prince Vasili and the eldest
1|princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a
1|short interval followed her. Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside
1|the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.
1|
1|"Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
1|necessary," said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the
1|same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
1|
1|"But, my dear princess," answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but
1|impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
1|from passing, "won't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment
1|when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul
1|is already prepared..."
1|
1|Prince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar
1|attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which
1|were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching
1|violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the
1|two ladies were saying.
1|
1|"Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases.
1|You know how fond the count is of her."
1|
1|"I don't even know what is in this paper," said the younger of the
1|two ladies, addressing Prince Vasili and pointing to an inlaid
1|portfolio she held in her hand. "All I know is that his real will is
1|in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten...."
1|
1|She tried to pass Anna Mikhaylovna, but the latter sprang so as to
1|bar her path.
1|
1|"I know, my dear, kind princess," said Anna Mikhaylovna, seizing the
1|portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
1|"Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je
1|vous en conjure..."
1|
1|The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the
1|portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the
1|princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna
1|Mikhaylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost
1|none of its honeyed firmness and softness.
1|
1|"Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place
1|in a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?"
1|
1|"Why don't you speak, cousin?" suddenly shrieked the princess so
1|loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled.
1|"Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to
1|interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man's room?
1|Intriguer!" she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the
1|portfolio.
1|
1|But Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold
1|on the portfolio, and changed her grip.
1|
1|Prince Vasili rose. "Oh!" said he with reproach and surprise,
1|"this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you."
1|
1|The princess let go.
1|
1|"And you too!"
1|
1|But Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him.
1|
1|"Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will
1|go and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?"
1|
1|"But, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna, "after such a solemn
1|sacrament, allow him a moment's peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your
1|opinion," said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite
1|close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the
1|princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of
1|Prince Vasili.
1|
1|"Remember that you will answer for the consequences," said Prince
1|Vasili severely. "You don't know what you are doing."
1|
1|"Vile woman!" shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna
1|Mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.
1|
1|Prince Vasili bent his head and spread out his hands.
1|
1|At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so
1|long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and
1|banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed
1|out wringing her hands.
1|
1|"What are you doing!" she cried vehemently. "He is dying and you
1|leave me alone with him!"
1|
1|Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikhaylovna, stooping,
1|quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom.
1|The eldest princess and Prince Vasili, recovering themselves, followed
1|her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard
1|face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression
1|showed an irrepressible hatred.
1|
1|"Yes, now you may be glad!" said she; "this is what you have been
1|waiting for." And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
1|handkerchief and rushed from the room.
1|
1|Prince Vasili came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre
1|was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand.
1|Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as
1|if in an ague.
1|
1|"Ah, my friend!" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there
1|was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in
1|it before. "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I
1|am near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all!
1|Death is awful..." and he burst into tears.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow,
1|quiet steps.
1|
1|"Pierre!" she said.
1|
1|Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his
1|forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:
1|
1|"He is no more...."
1|
1|Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
1|
1|"Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as
1|tears."
1|
1|She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one
1|could see his face. Anna Mikhaylovna left him, and when she returned
1|he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.
1|
1|In the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre:
1|
1|"Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.
1|But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in
1|command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I
1|know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but
1|it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man."
1|
1|Pierre was silent.
1|
1|"Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not
1|been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle
1|promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Boris. But
1|he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your
1|father's wish?"
1|
1|Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
1|silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna
1|Mikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs' and went to bed. On waking in the
1|morning she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details
1|of Count Bezukhov's death. She said the count had died as she would
1|herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but
1|edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so
1|touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not
1|know which had behaved better during those awful moments--the father
1|who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had
1|spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been
1|pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to
1|hide it in order not to sadden his dying father. "It is painful, but
1|it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count
1|and his worthy son," said she. Of the behavior of the eldest
1|princess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers
1|and as a great secret.
1|
1|

1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXV
1|
1|
1|At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonski's estate, the
1|arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but
1|this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
1|prince's household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andreevich
1|(nicknamed in society, "the King of Prussia") ever since the Emperor
1|Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
1|with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
1|capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that
1|anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow
1|to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to
1|say that there are only two sources of human vice--idleness and
1|superstition, and only two virtues--activity and intelligence. He
1|himself undertook his daughter's education, and to develop these two
1|cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till
1|she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was
1|occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving
1|problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working
1|in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on
1|at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating
1|activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point
1|of exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same
1|conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With
1|those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp
1|and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he
1|inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have
1|aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in
1|political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in
1|which the prince's estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and
1|waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or
1|Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the
1|appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the
1|same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study
1|door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with
1|powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which,
1|when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully
1|glittering eyes.
1|
1|On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive,
1|Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed
1|for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and
1|repeating a silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and
1|every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.
1|
1|An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
1|quietly and said in a whisper: "Please walk in."
1|
1|Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess
1|timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused
1|at the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after
1|glancing round continued his work.
1|
1|The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The
1|large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted
1|bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while
1|standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with
1|tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around--all
1|indicated continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of
1|the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and
1|the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince
1|still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age.
1|After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the
1|pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to
1|the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never
1|gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly
1|cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively,
1|said severely:
1|
1|"Quite well? All right then, sit down." He took the exercise book
1|containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a
1|chair with his foot.
1|
1|"For tomorrow!" said he, quickly finding the page and making a
1|scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.
1|
1|The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.
1|
1|"Wait a bit, here's a letter for you," said the old man suddenly,
1|taking a letter addressed in a woman's hand from a bag hanging above
1|the table, onto which he threw it.
1|
1|At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
1|princess' face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.
1|
1|"From Heloise?" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his
1|still sound, yellowish teeth.
1|
1|"Yes, it's from Julie," replied the princess with a timid glance and
1|a timid smile.
1|
1|"I'll let two more letters pass, but the third I'll read," said
1|the prince sternly; "I'm afraid you write much nonsense. I'll read the
1|third!"
1|
1|"Read this if you like, Father," said the princess, blushing still
1|more and holding out the letter.
1|
1|"The third, I said the third!" cried the prince abruptly, pushing
1|the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward
1|him the exercise book containing geometrical figures.
1|
1|"Well, madam," he began, stooping over the book close to his
1|daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,
1|so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of
1|old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. "Now, madam, these
1|triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC..."
1|
1|The princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyes
1|glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went,
1|and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened
1|that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father's
1|further explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was
1|the teacher's fault or the pupil's, this same thing happened every
1|day: the princess' eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear
1|anything, but was only conscious of her stern father's withered face
1|close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only
1|of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem
1|in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which
1|he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control
1|himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become
1|vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.
1|
1|The princess gave a wrong answer.
1|
1|"Well now, isn't she a fool!" shouted the prince, pushing the book
1|aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up
1|and down, lightly touched his daughter's hair and sat down again.
1|
1|He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.
1|
1|"This won't do, Princess; it won't do," said he, when Princess Mary,
1|having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day's
1|lesson, was about to leave: "Mathematics are most important, madam!
1|I don't want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and
1|you'll like it," and he patted her cheek. "It will drive all the
1|nonsense out of your head."
1|
1|She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an
1|uncut book from the high desk.
1|
1|"Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Heloise has
1|sent you. Religious! I don't interfere with anyone's belief... I
1|have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go."
1|
1|He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.
1|
1|Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared
1|expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly
1|face yet plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood
1|miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers.
1|The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down the
1|geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter. It was from
1|her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karagina
1|who had been at the Rostovs' name-day party.
1|
1|Julie wrote in French:
1|
1|
1|Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is
1|separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my
1|happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance
1|separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart
1|rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions
1|around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in
1|my heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were last
1|summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa?
1|Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength
1|from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so
1|well and seem to see before me as I write?
1|
1|
1|Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the
1|mirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful
1|figure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular
1|hopelessness at her reflection in the glass. "She flatters me,"
1|thought the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie
1|did not flatter her friend, the princess' eyes--large, deep and
1|luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts
1|of warm light)--were so beautiful that very often in spite of the
1|plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than
1|that of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of
1|her own eyes--the look they had when she was not thinking of
1|herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural
1|expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading:
1|
1|
1|All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is
1|already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on
1|their march to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg
1|and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances
1|of war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the
1|peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the
1|Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing
1|of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations
1|nearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostov, who with his
1|enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the
1|university to join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in
1|spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great
1|grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so
1|noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds
1|nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank
1|and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with
1|him, transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to
1|my poor heart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell
1|you about our parting and all that was said then. That is still too
1|fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant
1|joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally
1|the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever
1|to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic
1|and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of this!
1|The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old
1|Count Bezukhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses
1|have received very little, Prince Vasili nothing, and it is Monsieur
1|Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
1|recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezukhov and
1|possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince
1|Vasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that he
1|returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.
1|
1|I confess I understand very little about all these matters of
1|wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom
1|we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count
1|Bezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I
1|am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the
1|mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies
1|themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed
1|to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have
1|amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don't
1|even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as
1|the future Countess Bezukhova. But you will understand that I have
1|no desire for the post. A propos of marriages: do you know that a
1|while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikhaylovna told me, under the
1|seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neither
1|more nor less than with Prince Vasili's son Anatole, whom they wish to
1|reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee, and it is on
1|you that his relations' choice has fallen. I don't know what you
1|will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it.
1|He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is
1|all I have been able to find out about him.
1|
1|But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper,
1|and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apraksins'. Read the
1|mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here.
1|Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to
1|grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul.
1|Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments
1|to Mademoiselle Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.
1|
1|JULIE
1|
1|P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.
1|
1|
1|The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her
1|luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then
1|she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She
1|took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is
1|the reply she wrote, also in French:
1|
1|
1|Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great
1|delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which
1|you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual
1|effect on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say,
1|if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me?
1|Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why
1|do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for
1|that young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I
1|understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I
1|cannot approve of them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me
1|that Christian love, love of one's neighbor, love of one's enemy, is
1|worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful
1|eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl
1|like yourself.
1|
1|The news of Count Bezukhov's death reached us before your letter and
1|my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last
1|representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own
1|turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as
1|late as possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!
1|
1|I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He
1|always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the
1|quality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part
1|played by Prince Vasili, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear
1|friend, our divine Saviour's words, that it is easier for a camel to
1|go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
1|Kingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasili but am still
1|more sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches--to
1|what temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire
1|most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar. A
1|thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and
1|which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that among
1|some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding
1|cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading
1|what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never
1|could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their
1|minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts
1|and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration
1|quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the
1|Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they
1|contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the
1|terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this
1|flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let
1|us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which
1|our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to
1|conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less
1|we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God,
1|who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we
1|seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner
1|will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.
1|
1|My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me
1|that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince
1|Vasili. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you,
1|dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution
1|to which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should
1|the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I
1|shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without
1|disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may
1|give me for husband.
1|
1|I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy
1|arrival at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief
1|one, however, for he will leave, us again to take part in this unhappy
1|war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only
1|where you are--at the heart of affairs and of the world--is the talk
1|all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature--which
1|townsfolk consider characteristic of the country--rumors of war are
1|heard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and
1|countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day
1|before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I
1|witnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts
1|enrolled from our people and starting to join the army. You should
1|have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who
1|were going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as though
1|mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached
1|love and forgiveness of injuries--and that men attribute the
1|greatest merit to skill in killing one another.
1|
1|Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most
1|Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!
1|
1|MARY
1|
1|
1|"Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already
1|dispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother," said the smiling
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and
1|with guttural r's. She brought into Princess Mary's strenuous,
1|mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless,
1|lighthearted, and self-satisfied.
1|
1|"Princess, I must warn you," she added, lowering her voice and
1|evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with
1|exaggerated grasseyement, "the prince has been scolding Michael
1|Ivanovich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared."
1|
1|"Ah, dear friend," replied Princess Mary, "I have asked you never to
1|warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge
1|him and would not have others do so."
1|
1|The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five
1|minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the
1|sitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o'clock,
1|as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played
1|the clavichord.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVI
1|
1|
1|The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the
1|snoring of the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side
1|of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult
1|passages--twenty times repeated--of a sonata by Dussek.
1|
1|Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to
1|the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little
1|wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old
1|Tikhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the
1|antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and
1|hastily closed the door. Tikhon knew that neither the son's arrival
1|nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed
1|order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as
1|Tikhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father's
1|habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured
1|himself that they had not, he turned to his wife.
1|
1|"He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary's room,"
1|he said.
1|
1|The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes
1|and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak
1|just as merrily and prettily as ever.
1|
1|"Why, this is a palace!" she said to her husband, looking around
1|with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.
1|"Let's come, quick, quick!" And with a glance round, she smiled at
1|Tikhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.
1|
1|"Is that Mary practicing? Let's go quietly and take her by
1|surprise."
1|
1|Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
1|
1|"You've grown older, Tikhon," he said in passing to the old man, who
1|kissed his hand.
1|
1|Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
1|came, the pretty, fair haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,
1|rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.
1|
1|"Ah! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed she: "At last! I must let
1|her know."
1|
1|"No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne," said the
1|little princess, kissing her. "I know you already through my
1|sister-in-law's friendship for you. She was not expecting us?"
1|
1|They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the
1|sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped
1|and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.
1|
1|The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the
1|middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary's heavy tread and the
1|sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who
1|had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each
1|other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they
1|happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her
1|hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready
1|to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and
1|frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two
1|women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late,
1|seized each other's hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and
1|again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince
1|Andrew's surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease,
1|but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and
1|apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been
1|otherwise at this meeting.
1|
1|"Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!" they suddenly exclaimed, and then
1|laughed. "I dreamed last night..."--"You were not expecting us?..."
1|"Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?..." "And you have grown stouter!..."
1|
1|"I knew the princess at once," put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
1|
1|"And I had no idea!..." exclaimed Princess Mary. "Ah, Andrew, I
1|did not see you."
1|
1|Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another,
1|and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess
1|Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the
1|loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful
1|at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew's face.
1|
1|The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip
1|continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
1|and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
1|glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they
1|had had on the Spasski Hill which might have been serious for her in
1|her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had
1|left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would
1|have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that
1|Kitty Odyntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor
1|for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess
1|Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful
1|eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was
1|following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law's words.
1|In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she
1|addressed her brother:
1|
1|"So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" she said sighing.
1|
1|Lise sighed too.
1|
1|"Yes, and even tomorrow," replied her brother.
1|
1|"He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
1|promotion..."
1|
1|Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of
1|thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her
1|figure.
1|
1|"Is it certain?" she said.
1|
1|The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said:
1|"Yes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful..."
1|
1|Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law's
1|and unexpectedly again began to cry.
1|
1|"She needs rest," said Prince Andrew with a frown. "Don't you, Lise?
1|Take her to your room and I'll go to Father. How is he? Just the
1|same?"
1|
1|"Yes, just the same. Though I don't know what your opinion will be,"
1|answered the princess joyfully.
1|
1|"And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the
1|lathe?" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
1|showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he
1|was aware of his weaknesses.
1|
1|"The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and
1|my geometry lessons," said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her
1|lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.
1|
1|When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the
1|old prince to get up, Tikhon came to call the young prince to his
1|father. The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor
1|of his son's arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments
1|while he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in
1|old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and
1|when Prince Andrew entered his father's dressing room (not with the
1|contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the
1|animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting
1|on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle,
1|entrusting his head to Tikhon.
1|
1|"Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?" said the old
1|man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tikhon was
1|holding fast to plait, would allow.
1|
1|"You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like
1|this he'll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?" And he
1|held out his cheek.
1|
1|The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He
1|used to say that a nap "after dinner was silver--before dinner,
1|golden.") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his
1|thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father
1|on the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father's
1|favorite topic--making fun of the military men of the day, and more
1|particularly of Bonaparte.
1|
1|"Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,"
1|said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father's face with
1|an eager and respectful look. "How is your health?"
1|
1|"Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy
1|from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well."
1|
1|"Thank God," said his son smiling.
1|
1|"God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on," he continued,
1|returning to his hobby; "tell me how the Germans have taught you to
1|fight Bonaparte by this new science you call 'strategy.'"
1|
1|Prince Andrew smiled.
1|
1|"Give me time to collect my wits, Father," said he, with a smile
1|that showed that his father's foibles did not prevent his son from
1|loving and honoring him. "Why, I have not yet had time to settle
1|down!"
1|
1|"Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to
1|see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand.
1|"The house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there
1|and show her over, and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen. That's
1|their woman's way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About
1|Mikhelson's army I understand--Tolstoy's too... a simultaneous
1|expedition.... But what's the southern army to do? Prussia is
1|neutral... I know that. What about Austria?" said he, rising from
1|his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tikhon, who
1|ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. "What of
1|Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?"
1|
1|Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began--at first
1|reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from
1|habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on--to
1|explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained
1|how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to
1|bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of
1|that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two
1|hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand
1|Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty
1|thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how
1|a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French
1|from different sides. The old prince did not evince the least interest
1|during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it
1|continued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly
1|interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: "The white one, the white
1|one!"
1|
1|This meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he
1|wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying:
1|
1|"And will she soon be confined?" and shaking his head
1|reproachfully said: "That's bad! Go on, go on."
1|
1|The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
1|description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old
1|age: "Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra."*
1|
1|
1|*"Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he'll return."
1|
1|
1|His son only smiled.
1|
1|"I don't say it's a plan I approve of," said the son; "I am only
1|telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,
1|not worse than this one."
1|
1|"Well, you've told me nothing new," and the old man repeated,
1|meditatively and rapidly:
1|
1|"Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVII
1|
1|
1|At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the
1|dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who
1|by a strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though
1|the position of that insignificant individual was such as could
1|certainly not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who
1|generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely
1|admitted even important government officials to his table, had
1|unexpectedly selected Michael Ivanovich (who always went into a corner
1|to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory
1|that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his
1|daughter that Michael Ivanovich was "not a whit worse than you or
1|I." At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael
1|Ivanovich more often than to anyone else.
1|
1|In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was
1|exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen--one
1|behind each chair--stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head
1|butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making
1|signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the
1|door by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at
1|a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of
1|the Princes Bolkonski, opposite which hung another such frame with a
1|badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist
1|belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown--an alleged
1|descendant of Rurik and ancestor of the Bolkonskis. Prince Andrew,
1|looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a
1|man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original
1|as to be amusing.
1|
1|"How thoroughly like him that is!" he said to Princess Mary, who had
1|come up to him.
1|
1|Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not
1|understand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired
1|her with reverence and was beyond question.
1|
1|"Everyone has his Achilles' heel," continued Prince Andrew.
1|"Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!"
1|
1|Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother's
1|criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were
1|heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily
1|as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of
1|his manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the
1|great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from
1|the drawing room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes
1|from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and
1|rested on the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar
1|enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired
1|in all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly
1|on the back of her neck.
1|
1|"I'm glad, glad, to see you," he said, looking attentively into
1|her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. "Sit
1|down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ianovich!"
1|
1|He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman
1|moved the chair for her.
1|
1|"Ho, ho!" said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded
1|figure. "You've been in a hurry. That's bad!"
1|
1|He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips
1|only and not with his eyes.
1|
1|"You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible," he
1|said.
1|
1|The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She
1|was silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father,
1|and she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances,
1|and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him
1|greetings from various people and retailing the town gossip.
1|
1|"Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has
1|cried her eyes out," she said, growing more and more lively.
1|
1|As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more
1|sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had
1|formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael
1|Ivanovich.
1|
1|"Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of
1|it. Prince Andrew" (he always spoke thus of his son) "has been telling
1|me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I
1|never thought much of him."
1|
1|Michael Ivanovich did not at all know when "you and I" had said such
1|things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a
1|peg on which to hang the prince's favorite topic, he looked
1|inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.
1|
1|"He is a great tactician!" said the prince to his son, pointing to
1|the architect.
1|
1|And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and
1|the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced
1|not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know
1|the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an
1|insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no
1|longer any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him; but he was also
1|convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no
1|real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day
1|were playing, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily
1|bore with his father's ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and
1|listened to him with evident pleasure.
1|
1|"The past always seems good," said he, "but did not Suvorov
1|himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not
1|know how to escape?"
1|
1|"Who told you that? Who?" cried the prince. "Suvorov!" And he jerked
1|away his plate, which Tikhon briskly caught. "Suvorov!... Consider,
1|Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvorov; Moreau!... Moreau would
1|have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand; but he had the
1|Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled
1|the devil himself! When you get there you'll find out what those
1|Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvorov couldn't manage them so what
1|chance has Michael Kutuzov? No, my dear boy," he continued, "you and
1|your generals won't get on against Buonaparte; you'll have to call
1|in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The
1|German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the
1|Frenchman, Moreau," he said, alluding to the invitation made that year
1|to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... "Wonderful!... Were the
1|Potemkins, Suvorovs, and Orlovs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows
1|have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you,
1|but we'll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great
1|commander among them! Hm!..."
1|
1|"I don't at all say that all the plans are good," said Prince
1|Andrew, "I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may
1|laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great
1|general!"
1|
1|"Michael Ivanovich!" cried the old prince to the architect who, busy
1|with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: "Didn't I tell you
1|Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing."
1|
1|"To be sure, your excellency," replied the architect.
1|
1|The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
1|
1|"Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got
1|splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only
1|idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began
1|everybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no one--except one
1|another. He made his reputation fighting them."
1|
1|And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to
1|him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son
1|made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were
1|presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion.
1|He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how
1|this old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could
1|know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European
1|military and political events.
1|
1|"You think I'm an old man and don't understand the present state
1|of affairs?" concluded his father. "But it troubles me. I don't
1|sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours
1|shown his skill?" he concluded.
1|
1|"That would take too long to tell," answered the son.
1|
1|"Well, then go to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here's
1|another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours," he
1|exclaimed in excellent French.
1|
1|"You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!"
1|
1|"Dieu sait quand reviendra..." hummed the prince out of tune and,
1|with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.
1|
1|The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of
1|the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her
1|father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she
1|took her sister-in-law's arm and drew her into another room.
1|
1|"What a clever man your father is," said she; "perhaps that is why I
1|am afraid of him."
1|
1|"Oh, he is so kind!" answered Princess Mary.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVIII
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not
1|altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little
1|princess was in her sister-in-law's room. Prince Andrew in a traveling
1|coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms
1|assigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing
1|the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those
1|things he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a
1|large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a
1|saber--a present from his father who had brought it from the siege
1|of Ochakov. All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew's were in
1|very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with
1|tapes.
1|
1|When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men
1|capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At
1|such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince
1|Andrew's face looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind
1|him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking
1|straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear
1|going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?--perhaps both,
1|but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing
1|footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped
1|at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his
1|usual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy tread
1|of Princess Mary that he heard.
1|
1|"I hear you have given orders to harness," she cried, panting (she
1|had apparently been running), "and I did so wish to have another
1|talk with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You
1|are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrusha,"
1|she added, as if to explain such a question.
1|
1|She smiled as she uttered his pet name, "Andrusha." It was obviously
1|strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
1|Andrusha--the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
1|childhood.
1|
1|"And where is Lise?" he asked, answering her question only by a
1|smile.
1|
1|"She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.
1|Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have," said she, sitting
1|down on the sofa, facing her brother. "She is quite a child: such a
1|dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her."
1|
1|Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical
1|and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.
1|
1|"One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,
1|Andrew? Don't forget that she has grown up and been educated in
1|society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter
1|into everyone's situation. Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner.*
1|Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been
1|used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the
1|country, in her condition! It's very hard."
1|
1|
1|*To understand all is to forgive all.
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at
1|those we think we thoroughly understand.
1|
1|"You live in the country and don't think the life terrible," he
1|replied.
1|
1|"I... that's different. Why speak of me? I don't want any other
1|life, and can't, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young
1|society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her
1|life, all alone--for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what
1|poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best
1|society. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne...."
1|
1|"I don't like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all," said Prince
1|Andrew.
1|
1|"No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she's much to be
1|pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don't need her,
1|and she's even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am
1|even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She
1|and Michael Ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle
1|and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne
1|says: 'We don't love people so much for the good they have done us, as
1|for the good we have done them.' Father took her when she was homeless
1|after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father
1|likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads
1|splendidly."
1|
1|"To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's character sometimes
1|makes things trying for you, doesn't it?" Prince Andrew asked
1|suddenly.
1|
1|Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.
1|
1|"For me? For me?... Trying for me!..." said she.
1|
1|"He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he's getting
1|very trying," said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their
1|father in order to puzzle or test his sister.
1|
1|"You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of
1|intellectual pride," said the princess, following the train of her own
1|thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation--"and that's a
1|great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what
1|feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I
1|am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as
1|happy as I am."
1|
1|Her brother shook his head incredulously.
1|
1|"The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,
1|Andrew... is Father's way of treating religious subjects. I don't
1|understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what
1|is as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing
1|that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of
1|improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was
1|a monk he received and had a long talk with."
1|
1|"Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your
1|powder," said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.
1|
1|"Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.
1|Andrew..." she said timidly after a moment's silence, "I have a
1|great favor to ask of you."
1|
1|"What is it, dear?"
1|
1|"No--promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble
1|and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,
1|Andrusha!..." said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
1|taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
1|the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request
1|was granted.
1|
1|She looked timidly at her brother.
1|
1|"Even if it were a great deal of trouble..." answered Prince Andrew,
1|as if guessing what it was about.
1|
1|"Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as
1|you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father's father, our
1|grandfather, wore it in all his wars." (She still did not take out
1|what she was holding in her reticule.) "So you promise?"
1|
1|"Of course. What is it?"
1|
1|"Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
1|never take it off. Do you promise?"
1|
1|"If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break my neck...
1|To please you..." said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the
1|pained expression his joke had brought to his sister's face, he
1|repented and added: "I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad."
1|
1|"Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring
1|you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace," said she in a
1|voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before
1|her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour
1|in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.
1|
1|She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.
1|
1|"Please, Andrew, for my sake!..."
1|
1|Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes
1|lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her
1|brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew
1|understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of
1|tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.
1|
1|"Thank you, my dear." She kissed him on the forehead and sat down
1|again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.
1|
1|"As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you
1|always used to be. Don't judge Lise harshly," she began. "She is so
1|sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one."
1|
1|"I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Masha, or
1|blamed her. Why do you say all this to me?"
1|
1|Red patches appeared on Princess Mary's face and she was silent as
1|if she felt guilty.
1|
1|"I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to.
1|And I am sorry for that," he went on.
1|
1|The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried
1|to say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the
1|little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her
1|forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had
1|complained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After
1|crying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.
1|
1|"Know this, Masha: I can't reproach, have not reproached, and
1|never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach
1|myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in
1|whatever circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the
1|truth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No!
1|But why this is so I don't know..."
1|
1|As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed
1|her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and
1|unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over
1|her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.
1|
1|"Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or--go and wake and I'll come
1|in a moment. Petrushka!" he called to his valet: "Come here, take
1|these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right."
1|
1|Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:
1|"Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him
1|to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have
1|been answered."
1|
1|"Well, may be!" said Prince Andrew. "Go, Masha; I'll come
1|immediately."
1|
1|On the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected
1|one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne
1|smiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic
1|and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.
1|
1|"Oh! I thought you were in your room," she said, for some reason
1|blushing and dropping her eyes.
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger
1|suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at
1|her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt
1|that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he
1|reached his sister's room his wife was already awake and her merry
1|voice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door.
1|She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long
1|self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.
1|
1|"No, but imagine the old Countess Zubova, with false curls and her
1|mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old
1|age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!"
1|
1|This very sentence about Countess Zubova and this same laugh
1|Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of
1|others some five times. He entered the room softly. The little
1|princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work
1|in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg
1|reminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her
1|hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey. She answered
1|him and continued her chatter.
1|
1|The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn
1|night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
1|Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense
1|house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The
1|domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to
1|the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in
1|the reception hall: Michael Ivanovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne,
1|Princess Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been
1|called to his father's study as the latter wished to say good-by to
1|him alone. All were waiting for them to come out.
1|
1|When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
1|spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but
1|his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.
1|
1|"Going?" And he went on writing.
1|
1|"I've come to say good-by."
1|
1|"Kiss me here," and he touched his cheek: "Thanks, thanks!"
1|
1|"What do you thank me for?"
1|
1|"For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman's apron
1|strings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!" And he went
1|on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. "If you have
1|anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together," he
1|added.
1|
1|"About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your
1|hands..."
1|
1|"Why talk nonsense? Say what you want."
1|
1|"When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur....
1|Let him be here...."
1|
1|The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed
1|his stern eyes on his son.
1|
1|"I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work," said
1|Prince Andrew, evidently confused. "I know that out of a million cases
1|only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been
1|telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened."
1|
1|"Hm... Hm..." muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what
1|he was writing. "I'll do it."
1|
1|He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
1|laugh.
1|
1|"It's a bad business, eh?"
1|
1|"What is bad, Father?"
1|
1|"The wife!" said the old prince, briefly and significantly.
1|
1|"I don't understand!" said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"No, it can't be helped, lad," said the prince. "They're all like
1|that; one can't unmarry. Don't be afraid; I won't tell anyone, but you
1|know it yourself."
1|
1|He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it,
1|looked straight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see
1|through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.
1|
1|The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him.
1|The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and
1|throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed
1|rapidity.
1|
1|"What's to be done? She's pretty! I will do everything. Make your
1|mind easy," said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.
1|
1|Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his
1|father understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his
1|son.
1|
1|"Listen!" said he; "don't worry about your wife: what can be done
1|shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovich.* I
1|have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not
1|keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember
1|and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all
1|right--serve him. Nicholas Bolkonski's son need not serve under anyone
1|if he is in disfavor. Now come here."
1|
1|
1|*Kutuzov.
1|
1|
1|He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his
1|son was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised
1|the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled
1|with his bold, tall, close handwriting.
1|
1|"I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;
1|hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond
1|and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of
1|Suvorov's wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you
1|to read when I am gone. You will find them useful."
1|
1|Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long
1|time yet. He felt that he must not say it.
1|
1|"I will do it all, Father," he said.
1|
1|"Well, now, good-by!" He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced
1|him. "Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt
1|me, your old father..." he paused unexpectedly, and then in a
1|querulous voice suddenly shrieked: "but if I hear that you have not
1|behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!"
1|
1|"You need not have said that to me, Father," said the son with a
1|smile.
1|
1|The old man was silent.
1|
1|"I also wanted to ask you," continued Prince Andrew, "if I'm killed
1|and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you--as I said
1|yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please."
1|
1|"Not let the wife have him?" said the old man, and laughed.
1|
1|They stood silent, facing one another. The old man's sharp eyes were
1|fixed straight on his son's. Something twitched in the lower part of
1|the old prince's face.
1|
1|"We've said good-by. Go!" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry
1|voice, opening his door.
1|
1|"What is it? What?" asked both princesses when they saw for a moment
1|at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white
1|dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.
1|
1|Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.
1|
1|"Well!" he said, turning to his wife.
1|
1|And this "Well!" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying,:
1|"Now go through your performance."
1|
1|"Andrew, already!" said the little princess, turning pale and
1|looking with dismay at her husband.
1|
1|He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.
1|
1|He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her
1|face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.
1|
1|"Adieu, Mary," said he gently to his sister, taking her by the
1|hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.
1|
1|The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne
1|chafing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law,
1|still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through
1|which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his
1|direction. From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent
1|sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince
1|Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of
1|the old man in the white dressing gown looked out.
1|
1|"Gone? That's all right!" said he; and looking angrily at the
1|unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
1|the door.

1|BOOK TWO: 1805
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and
1|towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly
1|arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and
1|burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the
1|headquarters of the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov.
1|
1|On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just
1|reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be
1|inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance
1|of the locality and surroundings--fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled
1|roofs, and hills in the distance--and despite the fact that the
1|inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not
1|Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment
1|preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.
1|
1|On the evening of the last day's march an order had been received
1|that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march.
1|Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental
1|commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in
1|marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the
1|battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the
1|principle that it is always better to "bow too low than not bow low
1|enough." So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending
1|and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the
1|adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by
1|morning the regiment--instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it
1|had been on its last march the day before--presented a well-ordered
1|array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty,
1|had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness.
1|And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the
1|commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on
1|every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of
1|articles, "awl, soap, and all," as the soldiers say. There was only
1|one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was
1|the state of the soldiers' boots. More than half the men's boots
1|were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the
1|regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
1|been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched
1|some seven hundred miles.
1|
1|The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and
1|thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider
1|from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new
1|uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold
1|epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive
1|shoulders. He had the air of a man happily performing one of the
1|most solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line
1|and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was
1|plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and
1|that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to
1|indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair
1|sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.
1|
1|"Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?" he said, addressing one of the
1|battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain
1|that they both felt happy). "We had our hands full last night.
1|However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?"
1|
1|The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.
1|
1|"It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsaritsin Meadow."
1|
1|"What?" asked the commander.
1|
1|At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had
1|been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an
1|aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.
1|
1|The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
1|clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief
1|wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on
1|the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation
1|whatever.
1|
1|A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov the
1|day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army
1|of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, not considering
1|this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of
1|his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the
1|troops arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the
1|regiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the
1|commander in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know
1|these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that
1|the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and
1|that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On
1|hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged
1|his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.
1|
1|"A fine mess we've made of it!" he remarked.
1|
1|"There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if it was
1|said 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats?" said he reproachfully
1|to the battalion commander. "Oh, my God!" he added, stepping
1|resolutely forward. "Company commanders!" he shouted in a voice
1|accustomed to command. "Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?"
1|he asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently
1|relating to the personage he was referring to.
1|
1|"In an hour's time, I should say."
1|
1|"Shall we have time to change clothes?"
1|
1|"I don't know, General...."
1|
1|The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered
1|the soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders
1|ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the
1|greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares
1|that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and
1|stretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and
1|fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and
1|pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and
1|drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.
1|
1|In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had
1|become gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his
1|jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a
1|distance.
1|
1|"Whatever is this? This!" he shouted and stood still. "Commander
1|of the third company!"
1|
1|"Commander of the third company wanted by the general!...
1|commander to the general... third company to the commander." The words
1|passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing
1|officer.
1|
1|When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination
1|in a cry of: "The general to the third company," the missing officer
1|appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged
1|man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on
1|his toes toward the general. The captain's face showed the
1|uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not
1|learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was
1|evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The
1|general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting,
1|slackening his pace as he approached.
1|
1|"You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?"
1|shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and
1|pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat
1|of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. "What have you been
1|after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place?
1|Eh? I'll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade....
1|Eh...?"
1|
1|The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,
1|pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this
1|pressure lay his only hope of salvation.
1|
1|"Well, why don't you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as
1|a Hungarian?" said the commander with an austere gibe.
1|
1|"Your excellency..."
1|
1|"Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your
1|excellency?... nobody knows."
1|
1|"Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokhov, who has been reduced to
1|the ranks," said the captain softly.
1|
1|"Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?
1|If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the
1|others."
1|
1|"Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march."
1|
1|"Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you young men," said the
1|regimental commander cooling down a little. "Leave indeed.... One says
1|a word to you and you... What?" he added with renewed irritation, "I
1|beg you to dress your men decently."
1|
1|And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his
1|jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display
1|of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further
1|excuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished
1|badge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the
1|third company.
1|
1|"H-o-o-w are you standing? Where's your leg? Your leg?" shouted
1|the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there
1|were still five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray
1|uniform.
1|
1|Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with
1|his clear, insolent eyes in the general's face.
1|
1|"Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his
1|coat... the ras..." he did not finish.
1|
1|"General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure..."
1|Dolokhov hurriedly interrupted.
1|
1|"No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!"
1|
1|"Not bound to endure insults," Dolokhov concluded in loud, ringing
1|tones.
1|
1|The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became
1|silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
1|
1|"I request you to have the goodness to change your coat," he said as
1|he turned away.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|"He's coming!" shouted the signaler at that moment.
1|
1|The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the
1|stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle,
1|righted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute
1|countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment
1|fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless.
1|
1|"Att-ention!" shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking
1|voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment,
1|and welcome for the approaching chief.
1|
1|Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a
1|high, light blue Viennese caleche, slightly creaking on its springs
1|and drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the caleche galloped
1|the suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian
1|general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian
1|black ones. The caleche stopped in front of the regiment. Kutuzov
1|and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutuzov smiled
1|slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as
1|if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the
1|regimental commander did not exist.
1|
1|The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as
1|with a jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence
1|the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment
1|roared, "Health to your ex... len... len... lency!" and again all
1|became silent. At first Kutuzov stood still while the regiment
1|moved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite,
1|walked between the ranks.
1|
1|From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief
1|and devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and
1|from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals,
1|bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and
1|from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the
1|commander in chief, it was evident that he performed his duty as a
1|subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander.
1|Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the
1|regiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the
1|same time, was in splendid condition. There were only 217 sick and
1|stragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots.
1|
1|Kutuzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few
1|friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war,
1|sometimes also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several
1|times shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian
1|general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming
1|anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was.
1|The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to
1|miss a single word of the commander in chief's regarding the regiment.
1|Behind Kutuzov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to
1|be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen
1|talked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the
1|commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was Prince
1|Bolkonski. Beside him was his comrade Nesvitski, a tall staff officer,
1|extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes.
1|Nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar
1|officer who walked beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and
1|without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes,
1|watched the regimental commander's back and mimicked his every
1|movement. Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar
1|started and bent forward in exactly the same manner. Nesvitski laughed
1|and nudged the others to make them look at the wag.
1|
1|Kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which
1|were starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the
1|third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected
1|this, involuntarily came closer to him.
1|
1|"Ah, Timokhin!" said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had
1|been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.
1|
1|One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
1|more than Timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the
1|regimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed
1|him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not
1|have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him,
1|and so Kutuzov, who evidently understood his case and wished him
1|nothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile
1|flitting over his scarred and puffy face.
1|
1|"Another Ismail comrade," said he. "A brave officer! Are you
1|satisfied with him?" he asked the regimental commander.
1|
1|And the latter--unconscious that he was being reflected in the
1|hussar officer as in a looking glass--started, moved forward, and
1|answered: "Highly satisfied, your excellency!"
1|
1|"We all have our weaknesses," said Kutuzov smiling and walking
1|away from him. "He used to have a predilection for Bacchus."
1|
1|The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this
1|and did not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of
1|the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his
1|expression and pose with such exactitude that Nesvitski could not help
1|laughing. Kutuzov turned round. The officer evidently had complete
1|control of his face, and while Kutuzov was turning managed to make a
1|grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent
1|expression.
1|
1|The third company was the last, and Kutuzov pondered, apparently
1|trying to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from
1|among the suite and said in French:
1|
1|"You told me to remind you of the officer Dolokhov, reduced to the
1|ranks in this regiment."
1|
1|"Where is Dolokhov?" asked Kutuzov.
1|
1|Dolokhov, who had already changed into a soldier's gray greatcoat,
1|did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired
1|soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks,
1|went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.
1|
1|"Have you a complaint to make?" Kutuzov asked with a slight frown.
1|
1|"This is Dolokhov," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Ah!" said Kutuzov. "I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your
1|duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan't forget you if you
1|deserve well."
1|
1|The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as
1|boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by
1|their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates
1|a commander in chief so widely from a private.
1|
1|"One thing I ask of your excellency," Dolokhov said in his firm,
1|ringing, deliberate voice. "I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
1|and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!"
1|
1|Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had
1|turned from Captain Timokhin again flitted over his face. He turned
1|away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dolokhov had said
1|to him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he
1|was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away
1|and went to the carriage.
1|
1|The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their
1|appointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and
1|clothes and to rest after their hard marches.
1|
1|"You won't bear me a grudge, Prokhor Ignatych?" said the
1|regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its
1|quarters and riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front.
1|(The regimental commander's face now that the inspection was happily
1|over beamed with irrepressible delight.) "It's in the Emperor's
1|service... it can't be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on
1|parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very
1|pleased!" And he held out his hand to the captain.
1|
1|"Don't mention it, General, as if I'd be so bold!" replied the
1|captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where
1|two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end
1|of a gun at Ismail.
1|
1|"And tell Mr. Dolokhov that I won't forget him--he may be quite easy.
1|And tell me, please--I've been meaning to ask--how is he behaving
1|himself, and in general..."
1|
1|"As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your
1|excellency; but his character..." said Timokhin.
1|
1|"And what about his character?" asked the regimental commander.
1|
1|"It's different on different days," answered the captain. "One day
1|he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he's a
1|wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew."
1|
1|"Oh, well, well!" remarked the regimental commander. "Still, one
1|must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important
1|connections... Well, then, you just..."
1|
1|"I will, your excellency," said Timokhin, showing by his smile
1|that he understood his commander's wish.
1|
1|"Well, of course, of course!"
1|
1|The regimental commander sought out Dolokhov in the ranks and,
1|reining in his horse, said to him:
1|
1|"After the next affair... epaulettes."
1|
1|Dolokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the
1|mocking smile on his lips change.
1|
1|"Well, that's all right," continued the regimental commander. "A cup
1|of vodka for the men from me," he added so that the soldiers could
1|hear. "I thank you all! God be praised!" and he rode past that company
1|and overtook the next one.
1|
1|"Well, he's really a good fellow, one can serve under him," said
1|Timokhin to the subaltern beside him.
1|
1|"In a word, a hearty one..." said the subaltern, laughing (the
1|regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).
1|
1|The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected
1|the soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers' voices could
1|be heard on every side.
1|
1|"And they said Kutuzov was blind of one eye?"
1|
1|"And so he is! Quite blind!"
1|
1|"No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands...
1|he noticed everything..."
1|
1|"When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I..."
1|
1|"And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were
1|smeared with chalk--as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as
1|they do the guns."
1|
1|"I say, Fedeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You
1|were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau."
1|
1|"Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn't
1|know! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are
1|putting them down. When they've been put down, the war with Buonaparte
1|will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you're a fool.
1|You'd better listen more carefully!"
1|
1|"What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is
1|turning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat
1|cooked before we reach our quarters."
1|
1|"Give me a biscuit, you devil!"
1|
1|"And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That's just it, friend!
1|Ah, well, never mind, here you are."
1|
1|"They might call a halt here or we'll have to do another four
1|miles without eating."
1|
1|"Wasn't it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still
1|and are drawn along."
1|
1|"And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all
1|seemed to be Poles--all under the Russian crown--but here they're
1|all regular Germans."
1|
1|"Singers to the front" came the captain's order.
1|
1|And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A
1|drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and
1|flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers' song, commencing
1|with the words: "Morning dawned, the sun was rising," and
1|concluding: "On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father
1|Kamenski." This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now
1|being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words "Father
1|Kamenski" were replaced by "Father Kutuzov."
1|
1|Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms
1|as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer--a lean,
1|handsome soldier of forty--looked sternly at the singers and screwed
1|up his eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on
1|him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but
1|precious object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds,
1|suddenly flung it down and began:
1|
1|"Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!"
1|
1|"Oh, my bower new...!" chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet
1|player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the
1|front and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his
1|shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone.
1|The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously,
1|marched with long steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the
1|creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses' hoofs were heard.
1|Kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town. The commander in
1|chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and
1|he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and
1|the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men.
1|In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage
1|passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted
1|notice. It was Dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in
1|time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all
1|who were not at that moment marching with the company. The hussar
1|cornet of Kutuzov's suite who had mimicked the regimental commander,
1|fell back from the carriage and rode up to Dolokhov.
1|
1|Hussar cornet Zherkov had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to
1|the wild set led by Dolokhov. Zherkov had met Dolokhov abroad as a
1|private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kutuzov
1|had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the
1|cordiality of an old friend.
1|
1|"My dear fellow, how are you?" said he through the singing, making
1|his horse keep pace with the company.
1|
1|"How am I?" Dolokhov answered coldly. "I am as you see."
1|
1|The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
1|gaiety with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of
1|Dolokhov's reply.
1|
1|"And how do you get on with the officers?" inquired Zherkov.
1|
1|"All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto
1|the staff?"
1|
1|"I was attached; I'm on duty."
1|
1|Both were silent.
1|
1|"She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve," went the
1|song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.
1|Their conversation would probably have been different but for the
1|effect of that song.
1|
1|"Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?" asked Dolokhov.
1|
1|"The devil only knows! They say so."
1|
1|"I'm glad," answered Dolokhov briefly and clearly, as the song
1|demanded.
1|
1|"I say, come round some evening and we'll have a game of faro!" said
1|Zherkov.
1|
1|"Why, have you too much money?"
1|
1|"Do come."
1|
1|"I can't. I've sworn not to. I won't drink and won't play till I get
1|reinstated."
1|
1|"Well, that's only till the first engagement."
1|
1|"We shall see."
1|
1|They were again silent.
1|
1|"Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the
1|staff..."
1|
1|Dolokhov smiled. "Don't trouble. If I want anything, I won't beg--I'll
1|take it!"
1|
1|"Well, never mind; I only..."
1|
1|"And I only..."
1|
1|"Good-by."
1|
1|"Good health..."
1|
1|        "It's a long, long way.
1|        To my native land..."
1|
1|
1|Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly
1|from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down,
1|galloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping
1|time to the song.

1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|On returning from the review, Kutuzov took the Austrian general into
1|his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers
1|relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the
1|letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in
1|command of the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the
1|room with the required papers. Kutuzov and the Austrian member of
1|the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread
1|out.
1|
1|"Ah!..." said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by this
1|exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with
1|the conversation in French.
1|
1|"All I can say, General," said he with a pleasant elegance of
1|expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each
1|deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutuzov himself listened
1|with pleasure to his own voice. "All I can say, General, is that if
1|the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the
1|Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long
1|ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me
1|personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command
1|of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful
1|general--of whom Austria has so many--and to lay down all this heavy
1|responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,
1|General."
1|
1|And Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, "You are quite at
1|liberty not to believe me and I don't even care whether you do or not,
1|but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole
1|point."
1|
1|The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to
1|reply in the same tone.
1|
1|"On the contrary," he said, in a querulous and angry tone that
1|contrasted with his flattering words, "on the contrary, your
1|excellency's participation in the common action is highly valued by
1|His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the
1|splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have
1|been accustomed to win in their battles," he concluded his evidently
1|prearranged sentence.
1|
1|Kutuzov bowed with the same smile.
1|
1|"But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with
1|which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine
1|that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a
1|leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive
1|victory and no longer need our aid," said Kutuzov.
1|
1|The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an
1|Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the
1|unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutuzov's suggestion of an
1|Austrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kutuzov went on
1|blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that
1|he had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had
1|received from Mack's army informed him of a victory and stated
1|strategically the position of the army was very favorable.
1|
1|"Give me that letter," said Kutuzov turning to Prince Andrew.
1|"Please have a look at it"--and Kutuzov with an ironical smile about
1|the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following
1|passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand's letter:
1|
1|
1|We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men
1|with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech.
1|Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage
1|of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not
1|cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line
1|of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his
1|intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
1|ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the
1|Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in
1|conjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the
1|fate he deserves.
1|
1|
1|Kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at
1|the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.
1|
1|"But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect
1|the worst," said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have
1|done with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round
1|at the aide-de-camp.
1|
1|"Excuse me, General," interrupted Kutuzov, also turning to Prince
1|Andrew. "Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlovski all the reports
1|from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is
1|one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these," he
1|said, handing him several papers, "make a neat memorandum in French
1|out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the movements
1|of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency."
1|
1|Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from
1|the first not only what had been said but also what Kutuzov would have
1|liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,
1|stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.
1|
1|Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia,
1|he had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his
1|face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of
1|his former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man
1|who has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is
1|occupied with agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed
1|more satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and
1|glance were brighter and more attractive.
1|
1|Kutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very
1|kindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the
1|other adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more
1|serious commissions. From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrade,
1|Prince Andrew's father.
1|
1|
1|Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his
1|industry, firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to
1|have such a subordinate by me.
1|
1|
1|On Kutuzov's staff, among his fellow officers and in the army
1|generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two
1|quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be
1|different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great
1|things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with
1|them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority,
1|disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But
1|among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that
1|they respected and even feared him.
1|
1|Coming out of Kutuzov's room into the waiting room with the papers
1|in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp
1|on duty, Kozlovski, who was sitting at the window with a book.
1|
1|"Well, Prince?" asked Kozlovski.
1|
1|"I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
1|advancing."
1|
1|"And why is it?"
1|
1|Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.
1|
1|"Any news from Mack?"
1|
1|"No."
1|
1|"If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come."
1|
1|"Probably," said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.
1|
1|But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the
1|order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,
1|who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.
1|Prince Andrew stopped short.
1|
1|"Commander in Chief Kutuzov?" said the newly arrived general
1|speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and
1|advancing straight toward the inner door.
1|
1|"The commander in chief is engaged," said Kozlovski, going hurriedly
1|up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. "Whom
1|shall I announce?"
1|
1|The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski, who was
1|rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.
1|
1|"The commander in chief is engaged," repeated Kozlovski calmly.
1|
1|The general's face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He
1|took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out
1|the leaf, gave it to Kozlovski, stepped quickly to the window, and
1|threw himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if
1|asking, "Why do they look at me?" Then he lifted his head, stretched
1|his neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately, with
1|affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer
1|sound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened
1|and Kutuzov appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged
1|head bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making
1|long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kutuzov.
1|
1|"Vous voyez le malheureux Mack," he uttered in a broken voice.
1|
1|Kutuzov's face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
1|immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a
1|wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head
1|respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before
1|him, and closed the door himself behind him.
1|
1|The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been
1|beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be
1|correct. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various
1|directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had
1|hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief
1|interest lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack
1|and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the
1|campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian
1|army's position, and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part
1|he would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the
1|thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week's
1|time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian
1|encounter with the French since Suvorov met them. He feared that
1|Bonaparte's genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian
1|troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero
1|being disgraced.
1|
1|Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward
1|his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the
1|corridor he met Nesvitski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag
1|Zherkov; they were as usual laughing.
1|
1|"Why are you so glum?" asked Nesvitski noticing Prince Andrew's pale
1|face and glittering eyes.
1|
1|"There's nothing to be gay about," answered Bolkonski.
1|
1|Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvitski and Zherkov, there came toward
1|them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian
1|general who on Kutuzov's staff in charge of the provisioning of the
1|Russian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived
1|the previous evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for
1|the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherkov,
1|pushing Nesvitski aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,
1|
1|"They're coming!... they're coming!... Stand aside, make way, please
1|make way!"
1|
1|The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid
1|embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly
1|appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.
1|
1|"Your excellency," said he in German, stepping forward and
1|addressing the Austrian general, "I have the honor to congratulate
1|you."
1|
1|He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with
1|the other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.
1|
1|The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing
1|the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment's
1|attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.
1|
1|"I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived,
1|quite well, only a little bruised just here," he added, pointing
1|with a beaming smile to his head.
1|
1|The general frowned, turned away, and went on.
1|
1|"Gott, wie naiv!"* said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.
1|
1|*"Good God, what simplicity!"
1|
1|
1|Nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but
1|Bolkonski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and
1|turned to Zherkov. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
1|Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the
1|Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkov's untimely jest.
1|
1|"If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself," he said
1|sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, "I can't prevent
1|your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in
1|my presence, I will teach you to behave yourself."
1|
1|Nesvitski and Zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they
1|gazed at Bolkonski silently with wide-open eyes.
1|
1|"What's the matter? I only congratulated them," said Zherkov.
1|
1|"I am not jesting with you; please be silent!" cried Bolkonski,
1|and taking Nesvitski's arm he left Zherkov, who did not know what to
1|say.
1|
1|"Come, what's the matter, old fellow?" said Nesvitski trying to
1|soothe him.
1|
1|"What's the matter?" exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his
1|excitement. "Don't you understand that either we are officers serving
1|our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at
1|the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care
1|nothing for their master's business. Quarante mille hommes massacres
1|et l'armee de nos allies detruite, et vous trouvez la le mot pour
1|rire,"* he said, as if strengthening his views by this French
1|sentence. "C'est bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont
1|vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous.*[2] Only a
1|hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way," he added in Russian--but
1|pronouncing the word with a French accent--having noticed that Zherkov
1|could still hear him.
1|
1|
1|*"Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed,
1|and you find that a cause for jesting!"
1|
1|*[2] "It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow of whom
1|you have made a friend, but not for you, not for you."
1|
1|
1|He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he
1|turned and went out of the corridor.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|The Pavlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The
1|squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in
1|the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were
1|assigned to cavalry-captain Denisov, the squadron commander, known
1|throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov. Cadet
1|Rostov, ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had
1|lived with the squadron commander.
1|
1|On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the
1|news of Mack's defeat, the camp life of the officers of this
1|squadron was proceeding as usual. Denisov, who had been losing at
1|cards all night, had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early
1|in the morning from a foraging expedition. Rostov in his cadet
1|uniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg
1|over the saddle with a supple youthful movement, stood for a moment in
1|the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse, and at last sprang
1|down and called to his orderly.
1|
1|"Ah, Bondarenko, dear friend!" said he to the hussar who rushed up
1|headlong to the horse. "Walk him up and down, my dear fellow," he
1|continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted
1|young people show to everyone when they are happy.
1|
1|"Yes, your excellency," answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his
1|head.
1|
1|"Mind, walk him up and down well!"
1|
1|Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had
1|already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's
1|head. It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that
1|it paid to serve him. Rostov patted the horse's neck and then his
1|flank, and lingered for a moment.
1|
1|"Splendid! What a horse he will be!" he thought with a smile, and
1|holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the
1|porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork
1|in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his
1|face immediately brightened on seeing Rostov. "Schon gut Morgen! Schon
1|gut Morgen!"* he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to
1|greet the young man.
1|
1|
1|*"A very good morning! A very good morning!"
1|
1|
1|"Schon fleissig?"* said Rostov with the same gay brotherly smile
1|which did not leave his eager face. "Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen!
1|Kaiser Alexander hoch!"*[2] said he, quoting words often repeated by
1|the German landlord.
1|
1|
1|*"Busy already?"
1|
1|*[2] "Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians! Hurrah
1|for Emperor Alexander!"
1|
1|
1|The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and
1|waving it above his head cried:
1|
1|"Und die ganze Welt hoch!"*
1|
1|
1|*"And hurrah for the whole world!"
1|
1|
1|Rostov waved his cap above his head like the German and cried
1|laughing, "Und vivat die ganze Welt!" Though neither the German
1|cleaning his cowshed nor Rostov back with his platoon from foraging
1|for hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with
1|joyful delight and brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of
1|their mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German returning to
1|his cowshed and Rostov going to the cottage he occupied with Denisov.
1|
1|"What about your master?" he asked Lavrushka, Denisov's orderly,
1|whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.
1|
1|"Hasn't been in since the evening. Must have been losing,"
1|answered Lavrushka. "I know by now, if he wins he comes back early
1|to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he's
1|lost and will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?"
1|
1|"Yes, bring some."
1|
1|Ten minutes later Lavrushka brought the coffee. "He's coming!"
1|said he. "Now for trouble!" Rostov looked out of the window and saw
1|Denisov coming home. Denisov was a small man with a red face,
1|sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore
1|an unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a
1|crumpled shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch
1|gloomily, hanging his head.
1|
1|"Lavwuska!" he shouted loudly and angrily, "take it off, blockhead!"
1|
1|"Well, I am taking it off," replied Lavrushka's voice.
1|
1|"Ah, you're up already," said Denisov, entering the room.
1|
1|"Long ago," answered Rostov, "I have already been for the hay, and
1|have seen Fraulein Mathilde."
1|
1|"Weally! And I've been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a
1|damned fool!" cried Denisov, not pronouncing his r's. "Such ill
1|luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on.
1|Hullo there! Tea!"
1|
1|Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong
1|teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his
1|thick tangled black hair.
1|
1|"And what devil made me go to that wat?" (an officer nicknamed
1|"the rat") he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both
1|hands. "Just fancy, he didn't let me win a single cahd, not one cahd."
1|
1|He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in
1|his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while
1|he continued to shout.
1|
1|"He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles
1|it; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!"
1|
1|He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it
1|away. Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked
1|cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostov.
1|
1|"If at least we had some women here; but there's nothing foh one
1|to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who's
1|there?" he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy
1|boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a
1|respectful cough.
1|
1|"The squadron quartermaster!" said Lavrushka.
1|
1|Denisov's face puckered still more.
1|
1|"Wetched!" he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in
1|it. "Wostov, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove
1|the purse undah the pillow," he said, and went out to the
1|quartermaster.
1|
1|Rostov took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new
1|coins in separate piles, began counting them.
1|
1|"Ah! Telyanin! How d'ye do? They plucked me last night," came
1|Denisov's voice from the next room.
1|
1|"Where? At Bykov's, at the rat's... I knew it," replied a piping
1|voice, and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer of the same
1|squadron, entered the room.
1|
1|Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little
1|hand which was offered him. Telyanin for some reason had been
1|transferred from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very
1|well in the regiment but was not liked; Rostov especially detested him
1|and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to
1|the man.
1|
1|"Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?" he asked. (Rook
1|was a young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov.)
1|
1|The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in
1|the face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.
1|
1|"I saw you riding this morning..." he added.
1|
1|"Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answered Rostov, though the
1|horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half
1|that sum. "He's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg," he
1|added.
1|
1|"The hoof's cracked! That's nothing. I'll teach you what to do and
1|show you what kind of rivet to use."
1|
1|"Yes, please do," said Rostov.
1|
1|"I'll show you, I'll show you! It's not a secret. And it's a horse
1|you'll thank me for."
1|
1|"Then I'll have it brought round," said Rostov wishing to avoid
1|Telyanin, and he went out to give the order.
1|
1|In the passage Denisov, with a pipe, was squatting on the
1|threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing
1|Rostov, Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder
1|with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, he frowned
1|and gave a shudder of disgust.
1|
1|"Ugh! I don't like that fellow," he said, regardless of the
1|quartermaster's presence.
1|
1|Rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: "Nor do I, but
1|what's one to do?" and, having given his order, he returned to
1|Telyanin.
1|
1|Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had
1|left him, rubbing his small white hands.
1|
1|"Well there certainly are disgusting people," thought Rostov as he
1|entered.
1|
1|"Have you told them to bring the horse?" asked Telyanin, getting
1|up and looking carelessly about him.
1|
1|"I have."
1|
1|"Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denisov about
1|yesterday's order. Have you got it, Denisov?"
1|
1|"Not yet. But where are you off to?"
1|
1|"I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse," said Telyanin.
1|
1|They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant
1|explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.
1|
1|When Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on
1|the table. Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a
1|sheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rostov's face and said: "I am
1|witing to her."
1|
1|He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,
1|evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
1|write, told Rostov the contents of his letter.
1|
1|"You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sleep when we don't love. We
1|are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God,
1|one is pua' as on the first day of cweation... Who's that now? Send
1|him to the devil, I'm busy!" he shouted to Lavrushka, who went up to
1|him not in the least abashed.
1|
1|"Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It's the
1|quartermaster for the money."
1|
1|Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.
1|
1|"Wetched business," he muttered to himself. "How much is left in the
1|puhse?" he asked, turning to Rostov.
1|
1|"Seven new and three old imperials."
1|
1|"Oh, it's wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you
1|sca'cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh," he shouted to Lavrushka.
1|
1|"Please, Denisov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know," said
1|Rostov, blushing.
1|
1|"Don't like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don't," growled
1|Denisov.
1|
1|"But if you won't accept money from me like a comrade, you will
1|offend me. Really I have some," Rostov repeated.
1|
1|"No, I tell you."
1|
1|And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.
1|
1|"Where have you put it, Wostov?"
1|
1|"Under the lower pillow."
1|
1|"It's not there."
1|
1|Denisov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.
1|
1|"That's a miwacle."
1|
1|"Wait, haven't you dropped it?" said Rostov, picking up the
1|pillows one at a time and shaking them.
1|
1|He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.
1|
1|"Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you
1|kept it under your head like a treasure," said Rostov. "I put it
1|just here. Where is it?" he asked, turning to Lavrushka.
1|
1|"I haven't been in the room. It must be where you put it."
1|
1|"But it isn't?..."
1|
1|"You're always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget
1|it. Feel in your pockets."
1|
1|"No, if I hadn't thought of it being a treasure," said Rostov,
1|"but I remember putting it there."
1|
1|Lavrushka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and
1|under the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of
1|the room. Denisov silently watched Lavrushka's movements, and when the
1|latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
1|Denisov glanced at Rostov.
1|
1|"Wostov, you've not been playing schoolboy twicks..."
1|
1|Rostov felt Denisov's gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and
1|instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested
1|somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not
1|draw breath.
1|
1|"And there hasn't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant
1|and yourselves. It must be here somewhere," said Lavrushka.
1|
1|"Now then, you devil's puppet, look alive and hunt for it!"
1|shouted Denisov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man
1|with a threatening gesture. "If the purse isn't found I'll flog you,
1|I'll flog you all."
1|
1|Rostov, his eyes avoiding Denisov, began buttoning his coat, buckled
1|on his saber, and put on his cap.
1|
1|"I must have that purse, I tell you," shouted Denisov, shaking his
1|orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.
1|
1|"Denisov, let him alone, I know who has taken it," said Rostov,
1|going toward the door without raising his eyes. Denisov paused,
1|thought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostov hinted
1|at, seized his arm.
1|
1|"Nonsense!" he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood
1|out like cords. "You are mad, I tell you. I won't allow it. The
1|purse is here! I'll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found."
1|
1|"I know who has taken it," repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice, and
1|went to the door.
1|
1|"And I tell you, don't you dahe to do it!" shouted Denisov,
1|rushing at the cadet to restrain him.
1|
1|But Rostov pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though
1|Denisov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his
1|face.
1|
1|"Do you understand what you're saying?" he said in a trembling
1|voice. "There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it
1|is not so, then..."
1|
1|He could not finish, and ran out of the room.
1|
1|"Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody," were the last words
1|Rostov heard.
1|
1|Rostov went to Telyanin's quarters.
1|
1|"The master is not in, he's gone to headquarters," said Telyanin's
1|orderly. "Has something happened?" he added, surprised at the
1|cadet's troubled face.
1|
1|"No, nothing."
1|
1|"You've only just missed him," said the orderly.
1|
1|The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and
1|Rostov, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was
1|an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostov rode up to
1|it and saw Telyanin's horse at the porch.
1|
1|In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish
1|of sausages and a bottle of wine.
1|
1|"Ah, you've come here too, young man!" he said, smiling and
1|raising his eyebrows.
1|
1|"Yes," said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word;
1|and he sat down at the nearest table.
1|
1|Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in
1|the room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of
1|knives and the munching of the lieutenant.
1|
1|When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a
1|double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white,
1|turned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his
1|eyebrows gave it to the waiter.
1|
1|"Please be quick," he said.
1|
1|The coin was a new one. Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin.
1|
1|"Allow me to look at your purse," he said in a low, almost
1|inaudible, voice.
1|
1|With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin handed him
1|the purse.
1|
1|"Yes, it's a nice purse. Yes, yes," he said, growing suddenly
1|pale, and added, "Look at it, young man."
1|
1|Rostov took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in
1|it, and looked at Telyanin. The lieutenant was looking about in his
1|usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.
1|
1|"If we get to Vienna I'll get rid of it there but in these
1|wretched little towns there's nowhere to spend it," said he. "Well,
1|let me have it, young man, I'm going."
1|
1|Rostov did not speak.
1|
1|"And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite
1|decently here," continued Telyanin. "Now then, let me have it."
1|
1|He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostov let go
1|of it. Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into
1|the pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his
1|mouth slightly open, as if to say, "Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in
1|my pocket and that's quite simple and is no one else's business."
1|
1|"Well, young man?" he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted
1|brows he glanced into Rostov's eyes.
1|
1|Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin's eyes to
1|Rostov's and back, and back again and again in an instant.
1|
1|"Come here," said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin's arm and almost
1|dragging him to the window. "That money is Denisov's; you took
1|it..." he whispered just above Telyanin's ear.
1|
1|"What? What? How dare you? What?" said Telyanin.
1|
1|But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an
1|entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostov heard them, an enormous load of
1|doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to
1|pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun
1|had to be completed.
1|
1|"Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine," muttered
1|Telyanin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room.
1|"We must have an explanation..."
1|
1|"I know it and shall prove it," said Rostov.
1|
1|"I..."
1|
1|Every muscle of Telyanin's pale, terrified face began to quiver, his
1|eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not
1|rising to Rostov's face, and his sobs were audible.
1|
1|"Count!... Don't ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,
1|take it..." He threw it on the table. "I have an old father and
1|mother!..."
1|
1|Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin's eyes, and went out of the
1|room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced
1|his steps. "O God," he said with tears in his eyes, "how could you
1|do it?"
1|
1|"Count..." said Telyanin drawing nearer to him.
1|
1|"Don't touch me," said Rostov, drawing back. "If you need it, take
1|the money," and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|That same evening there was an animated discussion among the
1|squadron's officers in Denisov's quarters.
1|
1|"And I tell you, Rostov, that you must apologize to the colonel!"
1|said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and
1|many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostov who was crimson with
1|excitement.
1|
1|The staff captain, Kirsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks
1|for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.
1|
1|"I will allow no one to call me a liar!" cried Rostov. "He told me I
1|lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me on
1|duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me
1|apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
1|beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then..."
1|
1|"You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen," interrupted
1|the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.
1|"You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an
1|officer has stolen..."
1|
1|"I'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of
1|other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but
1|I am not a diplomatist. That's why I joined the hussars, thinking that
1|here one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying--so
1|let him give me satisfaction..."
1|
1|"That's all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that's not the
1|point. Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet
1|to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?"
1|
1|Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
1|conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered
1|the staff captain's question by a disapproving shake of his head.
1|
1|"You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
1|officers," continued the staff captain, "and Bogdanich" (the colonel
1|was called Bogdanich) "shuts you up."
1|
1|"He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth."
1|
1|"Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and
1|must apologize."
1|
1|"Not on any account!" exclaimed Rostov.
1|
1|"I did not expect this of you," said the staff captain seriously and
1|severely. "You don't wish to apologize, but, man, it's not only to him
1|but to the whole regiment--all of us--you're to blame all round. The
1|case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken
1|advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the
1|officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and
1|disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of
1|one scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don't see it like
1|that. And Bogdanich was a brick: he told you you were saying what
1|was not true. It's not pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear
1|fellow? You landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth
1|the thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish
1|to make the whole affair public. You are offended at being put on duty
1|a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever
1|Bogdanich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel!
1|You're quick at taking offense, but you don't mind disgracing the
1|whole regiment!" The staff captain's voice began to tremble. "You have
1|been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you're here today and
1|tomorrow you'll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your
1|fingers when it is said 'There are thieves among the Pavlograd
1|officers!' But it's not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denisov?
1|It's not the same!"
1|
1|Denisov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked
1|with his glittering black eyes at Rostov.
1|
1|"You value your own pride and don't wish to apologize," continued
1|the staff captain, "but we old fellows, who have grown up in and,
1|God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of
1|the regiment, and Bogdanich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old
1|fellow! And all this is not right, it's not right! You may take
1|offense or not but I always stick to mother truth. It's not right!"
1|
1|And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov.
1|
1|"That's twue, devil take it!" shouted Denisov, jumping up. "Now then,
1|Wostov, now then!"
1|
1| Rostov, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one
1|officer and then at the other.
1|
1|"No, gentlemen, no... you mustn't think... I quite understand.
1|You're wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of
1|the regiment I'd... Ah well, I'll show that in action, and for me
1|the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it's true I'm to blame,
1|to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?..."
1|
1|"Come, that's right, Count!" cried the staff captain, turning
1|round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand.
1|
1|"I tell you," shouted Denisov, "he's a fine fellow."
1|
1|"That's better, Count," said the staff captain, beginning to address
1|Rostov by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. "Go and
1|apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!"
1|
1|"Gentlemen, I'll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,"
1|said Rostov in an imploring voice, "but I can't apologize, by God I
1|can't, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little
1|boy asking forgiveness?"
1|
1|Denisov began to laugh.
1|
1|"It'll be worse for you. Bogdanich is vindictive and you'll pay
1|for your obstinacy," said Kirsten.
1|
1|"No, on my word it's not obstinacy! I can't describe the feeling.
1|I can't..."
1|
1|"Well, it's as you like," said the staff captain. "And what has
1|become of that scoundrel?" he asked Denisov.
1|
1|"He has weported himself sick, he's to be stwuck off the list
1|tomowwow," muttered Denisov.
1|
1|"It is an illness, there's no other way of explaining it," said
1|the staff captain.
1|
1|"Illness or not, he'd better not cwoss my path. I'd kill him!"
1|shouted Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone.
1|
1|Just then Zherkov entered the room.
1|
1|"What brings you here?" cried the officers turning to the newcomer.
1|
1|"We're to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his
1|whole army."
1|
1|"It's not true!"
1|
1|"I've seen him myself!"
1|
1|"What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?"
1|
1|"Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how
1|did you come here?"
1|
1|"I've been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,
1|Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on
1|Mack's arrival... What's the matter, Rostov? You look as if you'd just
1|come out of a hot bath."
1|
1|"Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew here these last two days."
1|
1|The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
1|Zherkov. They were under orders to advance next day.
1|
1|"We're going into action, gentlemen!"
1|
1|"Well, thank God! We've been sitting here too long!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Kutuzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges
1|over the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October
1|23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the
1|Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were
1|defiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.
1|
1|It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out
1|before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the
1|bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain,
1|and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects
1|could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down
1|below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed
1|houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed
1|jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels,
1|an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the
1|confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky
1|left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic
1|background of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a
1|convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on
1|the other side of the Enns the enemy's horse patrols could be
1|discerned.
1|
1|Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in
1|command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the
1|country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvitski, who
1|had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was
1|sitting on the trail of a gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied
1|him had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvitski was
1|treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel. The officers
1|gladly gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish
1|fashion on the wet grass.
1|
1|"Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It's
1|a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?" Nesvitski
1|was saying.
1|
1|"Thank you very much, Prince," answered one of the officers, pleased
1|to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. "It's a lovely
1|place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a
1|splendid house!"
1|
1|"Look, Prince," said another, who would have dearly liked to take
1|another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining
1|the countryside--"See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look
1|there in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging
1|something. They'll ransack that castle," he remarked with evident
1|approval.
1|
1|"So they will," said Nesvitski. "No, but what I should like,"
1|added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, "would be
1|to slip in over there."
1|
1|He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed
1|and gleamed.
1|
1|"That would be fine, gentlemen!"
1|
1|The officers laughed.
1|
1|"Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls
1|among them. On my word I'd give five years of my life for it!"
1|
1|"They must be feeling dull, too," said one of the bolder officers,
1|laughing.
1|
1|Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out
1|something to the general, who looked through his field glass.
1|
1|"Yes, so it is, so it is," said the general angrily, lowering the
1|field glass and shrugging his shoulders, "so it is! They'll be fired
1|on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?"
1|
1|On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and
1|from their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant
1|report of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the
1|crossing.
1|
1|Nesvitski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.
1|
1|"Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?" he said.
1|
1|"It's a bad business," said the general without answering him,
1|"our men have been wasting time."
1|
1|"Hadn't I better ride over, your excellency?" asked Nesvitski.
1|
1|"Yes, please do," answered the general, and he repeated the order
1|that had already once been given in detail: "and tell the hussars that
1|they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the
1|inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected."
1|
1|"Very good," answered Nesvitski.
1|
1|He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the
1|knapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.
1|
1|"I'll really call in on the nuns," he said to the officers who
1|watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the
1|hill.
1|
1|"Now then, let's see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!" said
1|the general, turning to an artillery officer. "Have a little fun to
1|pass the time."
1|
1|"Crew, to your guns!" commanded the officer.
1|
1|In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and
1|began loading.
1|
1|"One!" came the command.
1|
1|Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening
1|metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
1|troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little
1|smoke showing the spot where it burst.
1|
1|The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone
1|got up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as
1|plainly visible as if but a stone's throw away, and the movements of
1|the approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came
1|fully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the
1|solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a
1|single joyous and spirited impression.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Two of the enemy's shots had already flown across the bridge,
1|where there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvitski, who
1|had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed
1|against the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood
1|a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each
1|time Prince Nesvitski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed
1|him back again and pressed him against the railings, and all he
1|could do was to smile.
1|
1|"What a fine fellow you are, friend!" said the Cossack to a convoy
1|soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
1|crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. "What a fellow!
1|You can't wait a moment! Don't you see the general wants to pass?"
1|
1|But the convoyman took no notice of the word "general" and shouted
1|at the soldiers who were blocking his way. "Hi there, boys! Keep to
1|the left! Wait a bit." But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder
1|to shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a
1|dense mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvitski saw the
1|rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying
1|round the piles of the bridge chased each other along. Looking on
1|the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder
1|straps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and,
1|under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and
1|listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky mud
1|that covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the
1|monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of
1|the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different
1|from that of the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip of
1|wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a
1|townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and sometimes like
1|a log floating down the river, an officers' or company's baggage
1|wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides,
1|moved across the bridge.
1|
1|"It's as if a dam had burst," said the Cossack hopelessly. "Are
1|there many more of you to come?"
1|
1|"A million all but one!" replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat,
1|with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.
1|
1|"If he" (he meant the enemy) "begins popping at the bridge now,"
1|said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, "you'll forget to
1|scratch yourself."
1|
1|That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a
1|cart.
1|
1|"Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?" said an
1|orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.
1|
1|And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry
1|soldiers who had evidently been drinking.
1|
1|"And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt
1|end of his gun..." a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said
1|gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.
1|
1|"Yes, the ham was just delicious..." answered another with a loud
1|laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvitski did not learn who
1|had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.
1|
1|"Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they'll
1|all be killed," a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.
1|
1|"As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean," said a young
1|soldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, "I
1|felt like dying of fright. I did, 'pon my word, I got that
1|frightened!" said he, as if bragging of having been frightened.
1|
1|That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had
1|gone before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a
1|German, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine
1|brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A
1|woman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl
1|with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently
1|these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes
1|of all the soldiers turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was
1|passing at foot pace all the soldiers' remarks related to the two
1|young ones. Every face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly
1|thoughts about the women.
1|
1|"Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!"
1|
1|"Sell me the missis," said another soldier, addressing the German,
1|who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast
1|eyes.
1|
1|"See how smart she's made herself! Oh, the devils!"
1|
1|"There, Fedotov, you should be quartered on them!"
1|
1|"I have seen as much before now, mate!"
1|
1|"Where are you going?" asked an infantry officer who was eating an
1|apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.
1|
1|The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.
1|
1|"Take it if you like," said the officer, giving the girl an apple.
1|
1|The girl smiled and took it. Nesvitski like the rest of the men on
1|the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed.
1|When they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with
1|the same kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens,
1|the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the
1|bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.
1|
1|"And why are they stopping? There's no proper order!" said the
1|soldiers. "Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can't you wait?
1|It'll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here's an officer jammed
1|in too"--different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men
1|looked at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the
1|bridge.
1|
1|Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvitski
1|suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...
1|something big, that splashed into the water.
1|
1|"Just see where it carries to!" a soldier near by said sternly,
1|looking round at the sound.
1|
1|"Encouraging us to get along quicker," said another uneasily.
1|
1|The crowd moved on again. Nesvitski realized that it was a cannon
1|ball.
1|
1|"Hey, Cossack, my horse!" he said. "Now, then, you there! get out of
1|the way! Make way!"
1|
1|With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting
1|continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make
1|way for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and
1|those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed
1|still harder from behind.
1|
1|"Nesvitski, Nesvitski! you numskull!" came a hoarse voice from
1|behind him.
1|
1|Nesvitski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but
1|separated by the living mass of moving infantry, Vaska Denisov, red
1|and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak
1|hanging jauntily over his shoulder.
1|
1|"Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!" shouted Denisov
1|evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot
1|whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a
1|small bare hand as red as his face.
1|
1|"Ah, Vaska!" joyfully replied Nesvitski. "What's up with you?"
1|
1|"The squadwon can't pass," shouted Vaska Denisov, showing his
1|white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which
1|twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting
1|white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his
1|hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider
1|let him. "What is this? They're like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of
1|the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart!
1|I'll hack you with my saber!" he shouted, actually drawing his saber
1|from its scabbard and flourishing it.
1|
1|The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and
1|Denisov joined Nesvitski.
1|
1|"How's it you're not drunk today?" said Nesvitski when the other had
1|ridden up to him.
1|
1|"They don't even give one time to dwink!" answered Vaska Denisov.
1|"They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean to
1|fight, let's fight. But the devil knows what this is."
1|
1|"What a dandy you are today!" said Nesvitski, looking at Denisov's
1|new cloak and saddlecloth.
1|
1|Denisov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that
1|diffused a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvitski's nose.
1|
1|"Of course. I'm going into action! I've shaved, bwushed my teeth,
1|and scented myself."
1|
1|The imposing figure of Nesvitski followed by his Cossack, and the
1|determination of Denisov who flourished his sword and shouted
1|frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through
1|to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the
1|bridge Nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the
1|order, and having done this he rode back.
1|
1|Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge.
1|Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
1|ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
1|nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
1|resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
1|front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to
1|emerge on his side of it.
1|
1|The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
1|trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,
1|estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
1|encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past
1|them in regular order.
1|
1|"Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!" said one.
1|
1|"What good are they? They're led about just for show!" remarked
1|another.
1|
1|"Don't kick up the dust, you infantry!" jested an hussar whose
1|prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.
1|
1|"I'd like to put you on a two days' march with a knapsack! Your fine
1|cords would soon get a bit rubbed," said an infantryman, wiping the
1|mud off his face with his sleeve. "Perched up there, you're more
1|like a bird than a man."
1|
1|"There now, Zikin, they ought to put you on a horse. You'd look
1|fine," said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent
1|under the weight of his knapsack.
1|
1|"Take a stick between your legs, that'll suit you for a horse!"
1|the hussar shouted back.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing
1|together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last
1|the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last
1|battalion came onto the bridge. Only Denisov's squadron of hussars
1|remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could
1|be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible
1|from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which
1|the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile
1|away. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of
1|our Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the
1|high ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These
1|were the French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at
1|a trot. All the officers and men of Denisov's squadron, though they
1|tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought
1|only of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking
1|at the patches appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the
1|enemy's troops. The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun
1|was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around
1|it. It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of
1|the enemy could be heard from the hill. There was no one now between
1|the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An
1|empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them.
1|The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible,
1|and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the
1|more clearly felt.
1|
1|"One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line
1|dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and
1|death. And what is there? Who is there?--there beyond that field, that
1|tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to
1|know. You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner
1|or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is
1|there, just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other
1|side of death. But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and
1|are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men." So
1|thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the
1|enemy, and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness
1|of impression to everything that takes place at such moments.
1|
1|On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon
1|rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron.
1|The officers who had been standing together rode off to their
1|places. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence
1|fell on the whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and
1|at the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command. A second
1|and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the
1|hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads
1|of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not
1|look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of
1|command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so
1|different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the
1|stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads
1|glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades' impression.
1|Every face, from Denisov's to that of the bugler, showed one common
1|expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and
1|mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if
1|threatening to punish them. Cadet Mironov ducked every time a ball
1|flew past. Rostov on the left flank, mounted on his Rook--a handsome
1|horse despite its game leg--had the happy air of a schoolboy called up
1|before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he
1|will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear,
1|bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under
1|fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of
1|something new and stern showed round the mouth.
1|
1|"Who's that curtseying there? Cadet Miwonov! That's not wight!
1|Look at me," cried Denisov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept
1|turning his horse in front of the squadron.
1|
1|The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Vaska Denisov, and his whole
1|short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in
1|which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually
1|did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second
1|bottle; he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown
1|back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into
1|the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling
1|backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the
1|squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their
1|pistols. He rode up to Kirsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed,
1|steady mare came at a walk to meet him. His face with its long
1|mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were brighter than
1|usual.
1|
1|"Well, what about it?" said he to Denisov. "It won't come to a
1|fight. You'll see--we shall retire."
1|
1|"The devil only knows what they're about!" muttered Denisov. "Ah,
1|Wostov," he cried noticing the cadet's bright face, "you've got it
1|at last."
1|
1|And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet.
1|Rostov felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the
1|bridge. Denisov galloped up to him.
1|
1|"Your excellency! Let us attack them! I'll dwive them off."
1|
1|"Attack indeed!" said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his
1|face as if driving off a troublesome fly. "And why are you stopping
1|here? Don't you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the
1|squadron back."
1|
1|The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire
1|without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in
1|the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted
1|the farther side of the river.
1|
1|The two Pavlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up
1|the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdanich
1|Schubert, came up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a footpace not far
1|from Rostov, without taking any notice of him although they were now
1|meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning
1|Telyanin. Rostov, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of
1|a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not
1|lift his eyes from the colonel's athletic back, his nape covered
1|with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostov that
1|Bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole
1|aim now was to test the cadet's courage, so he drew himself up and
1|looked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdanich rode
1|so near in order to show him his courage. Next he thought that his
1|enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish
1|him--Rostov. Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdanich would
1|come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the
1|hand of reconciliation.
1|
1|The high-shouldered figure of Zherkov, familiar to the Pavlograds as
1|he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After
1|his dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained in the
1|regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front
1|when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and
1|had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince
1|Bagration. He now came to his former chief with an order from the
1|commander of the rear guard.
1|
1|"Colonel," he said, addressing Rostov's enemy with an air of
1|gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, "there is an
1|order to stop and fire the bridge."
1|
1|"An order to who?" asked the colonel morosely.
1|
1|"I don't myself know 'to who,'" replied the cornet in a serious
1|tone, "but the prince told me to 'go and tell the colonel that the
1|hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.'"
1|
1|Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
1|colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout
1|Nesvitski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely
1|carry his weight.
1|
1|"How's this, Colonel?" he shouted as he approached. "I told you to
1|fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are
1|all beside themselves over there and one can't make anything out."
1|
1|The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to
1|Nesvitski.
1|
1|"You spoke to me of inflammable material," said he, "but you said
1|nothing about firing it."
1|
1|"But, my dear sir," said Nesvitski as he drew up, taking off his cap
1|and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,
1|"wasn't I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material
1|had been put in position?"
1|
1|"I am not your 'dear sir,' Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell
1|me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders
1|strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would
1|it burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!"
1|
1|"Ah, that's always the way!" said Nesvitski with a wave of the hand.
1|"How did you get here?" said he, turning to Zherkov.
1|
1|"On the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!"
1|
1|"You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer..." continued the colonel in
1|an offended tone.
1|
1|"Colonel," interrupted the officer of the suite, "You must be
1|quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot."
1|
1|The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the
1|stout staff officer, and at Zherkov, and he frowned.
1|
1|"I will the bridge fire," he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
1|that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would
1|still do the right thing.
1|
1|Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to
1|blame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
1|squadron, that in which Rostov was serving under Denisov, to return to
1|the bridge.
1|
1|"There, it's just as I thought," said Rostov to himself. "He
1|wishes to test me!" His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his
1|face. "Let him see whether I am a coward!" he thought.
1|
1|Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
1|appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostov watched his enemy,
1|the colonel, closely--to find in his face confirmation of his own
1|conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostov, and
1|looked as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came
1|the word of command.
1|
1|"Look sharp! Look sharp!" several voices repeated around him.
1|
1|Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the
1|hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The
1|men were crossing themselves. Rostov no longer looked at the
1|colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the
1|hussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand
1|trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly's charge, and he felt
1|the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denisov rode past him,
1|leaning back and shouting something. Rostov saw nothing but the
1|hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their
1|sabers clattering.
1|
1|"Stretchers!" shouted someone behind him.
1|
1|Rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,
1|trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not
1|looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud,
1|stumbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.
1|
1|"At boss zides, Captain," he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
1|having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
1|triumphant, cheerful face.
1|
1|Rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy
1|and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the
1|front the better. But Bogdanich, without looking at or recognizing
1|Rostov, shouted to him:
1|
1|"Who's that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right!
1|Come back, Cadet!" he cried angrily; and turning to Denisov, who,
1|showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:
1|
1|"Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount," he said.
1|
1|"Oh, every bullet has its billet," answered Vaska Denisov, turning
1|in his saddle.
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite were
1|standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small
1|group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,
1|and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then
1|at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side--the
1|blue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as
1|artillery.
1|
1|"Will they burn the bridge or not? Who'll get there first? Will they
1|get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within
1|grapeshot range and wipe them out?" These were the questions each
1|man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily
1|asked himself with a sinking heart--watching the bridge and the
1|hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from
1|the other side with their bayonets and guns.
1|
1|"Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!" said Nesvitski; "they are within
1|grapeshot range now."
1|
1|"He shouldn't have taken so many men," said the officer of the
1|suite.
1|
1|"True enough," answered Nesvitski; "two smart fellows could have
1|done the job just as well."
1|
1|"Ah, your excellency," put in Zherkov, his eyes fixed on the
1|hussars, but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know
1|whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. "Ah, your excellency!
1|How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the
1|Vladimir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered,
1|the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon.
1|Our Bogdanich knows how things are done."
1|
1|"There now!" said the officer of the suite, "that's grapeshot."
1|
1|He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being
1|detached and hurriedly removed.
1|
1|On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke
1|appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at
1|the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two
1|reports one after another, and a third.
1|
1|"Oh! Oh!" groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, seizing the
1|officer of the suite by the arm. "Look! A man has fallen! Fallen,
1|fallen!"
1|
1|"Two, I think."
1|
1|"If I were Tsar I would never go to war," said Nesvitski, turning
1|away.
1|
1|The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue
1|uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again but
1|at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
1|bridge. But this time Nesvitski could not see what was happening
1|there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had
1|succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now
1|firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were
1|trained and there was someone to fire at.
1|
1|The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the
1|hussars got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot
1|went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of
1|hussars and knocked three of them over.
1|
1|Rostov, absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had paused on
1|the bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he
1|had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the
1|bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like
1|the other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard
1|a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar
1|nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostov ran up to
1|him with the others. Again someone shouted, "Stretchers!" Four men
1|seized the hussar and began lifting him.
1|
1|"Oooh! For Christ's sake let me alone!" cried the wounded man, but
1|still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.
1|
1|Nicholas Rostov turned away and, as if searching for something,
1|gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky,
1|and at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm,
1|and how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what
1|soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer
1|still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery,
1|the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests veiled in the mist of
1|their summits... There was peace and happiness... "I should wish
1|for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there," thought Rostov.
1|"In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness;
1|but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry...
1|There--they are shouting again, and again are all running back
1|somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here above
1|me and around... Another instant and I shall never again see the
1|sun, this water, that gorge!..."
1|
1|At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other
1|stretchers came into view before Rostov. And the fear of death and
1|of the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into
1|one feeling of sickening agitation.
1|
1|"O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect
1|me!" Rostov whispered.
1|
1|The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their
1|voices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from
1|sight.
1|
1|"Well, fwiend? So you've smelt powdah!" shouted Vaska Denisov just
1|above his ear.
1|
1|"It's all over; but I am a coward--yes, a coward!" thought Rostov,
1|and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one
1|foot, from the orderly and began to mount.
1|
1|"Was that grapeshot?" he asked Denisov.
1|
1|"Yes and no mistake!" cried Denisov. "You worked like wegular bwicks
1|and it's nasty work! An attack's pleasant work! Hacking away at the
1|dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them shooting
1|at you like a target."
1|
1|And Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostov,
1|composed of the colonel, Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer from
1|the suite.
1|
1|"Well, it seems that no one has noticed," thought Rostov. And this
1|was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation
1|which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.
1|
1|"Here's something for you to report," said Zherkov. "See if I
1|don't get promoted to a sublieutenancy."
1|
1|"Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!" said the colonel
1|triumphantly and gaily.
1|
1|"And if he asks about the losses?"
1|
1|"A trifle," said the colonel in his bass voice: "two hussars
1|wounded, and one knocked out," he added, unable to restrain a happy
1|smile, and pronouncing the phrase "knocked out" with ringing
1|distinctness.
1|

1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the
1|command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to
1|it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of
1|supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything
1|that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men
1|commanded by Kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube,
1|stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions
1|only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its
1|heavy equipment. There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and
1|Melk; but despite the courage and endurance--acknowledged even by
1|the enemy--with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of
1|these actions was a yet more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had
1|escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutuzov at Braunau now separated
1|from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left with only his own weak and
1|exhausted forces. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought
1|of. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared
1|in accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to
1|Kutuzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the
1|sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a
1|junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, without
1|losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.
1|
1|On the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his army crossed to the
1|left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with
1|the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the
1|thirtieth he attacked Mortier's division, which was on the left
1|bank, and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were
1|taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time,
1|after a fortnight's retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a
1|fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French.
1|Though the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of
1|their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number
1|of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube
1|with a letter in which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the
1|enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems
1|converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all
1|the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over
1|Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the
1|whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors
1|were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some
1|victory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of the
1|frightened Bonaparte.
1|
1|Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the
1|Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse
1|had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a
1|bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief's special favor he was
1|sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no
1|longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Brunn.
1|Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure
1|physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the
1|night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary,
1|with dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov, he was sent immediately
1|with a special dispatch to Brunn. To be so sent meant not only a
1|reward but an important step toward promotion.
1|
1|The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow
1|that had fallen the previous day--the day of the battle. Reviewing his
1|impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself
1|the impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the
1|send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow
1|officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise
1|enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a
1|long-desired happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes his ears
1|seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of
1|victory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running
1|away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself
1|with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so
1|but that on the contrary the French had run away. He again recalled
1|all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the
1|battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark starry night
1|was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was thawing in the
1|sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road
1|were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.
1|
1|At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.
1|The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the
1|front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each
1|of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were
1|being jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he
1|heard Russian words), others were eating bread; the more severely
1|wounded looked silently, with the languid interest of sick children,
1|at the envoy hurrying past them.
1|
1|Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what
1|action they had been wounded. "Day before yesterday, on the Danube,"
1|answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the
1|soldier three gold pieces.
1|
1|"That's for them all," he said to the officer who came up.
1|
1|"Get well soon, lads!" he continued, turning to the soldiers.
1|"There's plenty to do still."
1|
1|"What news, sir?" asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a
1|conversation.
1|
1|"Good news!... Go on!" he shouted to the driver, and they galloped
1|on.
1|
1|It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the
1|paved streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings,
1|the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all
1|that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so
1|attractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and
1|sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt
1|even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before. Only his
1|eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with
1|extraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again vividly recalled the
1|details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the
1|concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to
1|the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that
1|might be put to him and the answers he would give. He expected to be
1|at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the palace,
1|however, an official came running out to meet him, and learning that
1|he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.
1|
1|"To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will
1|find the adjutant on duty," said the official. "He will conduct you to
1|the Minister of War."
1|
1|The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait,
1|and went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and
1|bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along
1|a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The
1|adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
1|attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.
1|
1|Prince Andrew's joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
1|approached the door of the minister's room. He felt offended, and
1|without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
1|one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind
1|instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to
1|despise the adjutant and the minister. "Away from the smell of powder,
1|they probably think it easy to gain victories!" he thought. His eyes
1|narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with
1|peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened
1|when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers
1|and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three
1|minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each
1|side of the minister's bent bald head with its gray temples. He went
1|on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of
1|the door and the sound of footsteps.
1|
1|"Take this and deliver it," said he to his adjutant, handing him the
1|papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.
1|
1|Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzov's army
1|interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he
1|was concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger
1|that impression. "But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,"
1|he thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together,
1|arranged them evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual
1|and distinctive head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the
1|firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently
1|deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial
1|smile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man
1|who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another.
1|
1|"From General Field Marshal Kutuzov?" he asked. "I hope it is good
1|news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high
1|time!"
1|
1|He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
1|with a mournful expression.
1|
1|"Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!" he exclaimed in German. "What a
1|calamity! What a calamity!"
1|
1|Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and
1|looked at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.
1|
1|"Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is
1|not captured." Again he pondered. "I am very glad you have brought
1|good news, though Schmidt's death is a heavy price to pay for the
1|victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I
1|thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the
1|parade. However, I will let you know."
1|
1|The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,
1|reappeared.
1|
1|"Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to
1|see you," he added, bowing his head.
1|
1|When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and
1|happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
1|indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant.
1|The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle
1|seemed the memory of a remote event long past.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin, a Russian acquaintance
1|of his in the diplomatic service.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,"
1|said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. "Franz, put the
1|prince's things in my bedroom," said he to the servant who was
1|ushering Bolkonski in. "So you're a messenger of victory, eh?
1|Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see."
1|
1|After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat's
1|luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilibin
1|settled down comfortably beside the fire.
1|
1|After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived
1|of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life,
1|Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious
1|surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides
1|it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not
1|in Russian (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who
1|would, he supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the
1|Austrians which was then particularly strong.
1|
1|Bilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle
1|as Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in
1|Petersburg, but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in
1|Vienna with Kutuzov. Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave
1|promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an even
1|greater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic
1|career. He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had
1|entered the service at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and
1|Copenhagen, and now held a rather important post in Vienna. Both the
1|foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him.
1|He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they
1|have certain negative qualities, avoid doing certain things, and speak
1|French. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it,
1|and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his
1|writing table. He worked well whatever the import of his work. It
1|was not the question "What for?" but the question "How?" that
1|interested him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care,
1|but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or
1|report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bilibin's services
1|were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in
1|dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.
1|
1|Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be
1|made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to
1|say something striking and took part in a conversation only when
1|that was possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with
1|wittily original, finished phrases of general interest. These
1|sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a
1|portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society
1|people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room. And, in
1|fact, Bilibin's witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing
1|rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important.
1|
1|His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which
1|always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one's fingers
1|after a Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the
1|principal play of expression on his face. Now his forehead would
1|pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows
1|would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small,
1|deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.
1|
1|"Well, now tell me about your exploits," said he.
1|
1|Bolkonski, very modestly without once mentioning himself,
1|described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.
1|
1|"They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
1|skittles," said he in conclusion.
1|
1|Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.
1|
1|"Cependant, mon cher," he remarked, examining his nails from a
1|distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, "malgre la haute
1|estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j'avoue que
1|votre victoire n'est pas des plus victorieuses."*
1|
1|
1|*"But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian
1|army, I must say that your victory was not particularly victorious."
1|
1|
1|He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those
1|words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.
1|
1|"Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate
1|Mortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your
1|fingers! Where's the victory?"
1|
1|"But seriously," said Prince Andrew, "we can at any rate say without
1|boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm..."
1|
1|"Why didn't you capture one, just one, marshal for us?"
1|
1|"Because not everything happens as one expects or with the
1|smoothness of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at
1|their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in
1|the afternoon."
1|
1|"And why didn't you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have
1|been there at seven in the morning," returned Bilibin with a smile.
1|"You ought to have been there at seven in the morning."
1|
1|"Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic
1|methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?" retorted Prince
1|Andrew in the same tone.
1|
1|"I know," interrupted Bilibin, "you're thinking it's very easy to
1|take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but
1|still why didn't you capture him? So don't be surprised if not only
1|the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and
1|King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor
1|secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of
1|my joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to
1|the Prater... True, we have no Prater here..."
1|
1|He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
1|forehead.
1|
1|"It is now my turn to ask you 'why?' mon cher," said Bolkonski. "I
1|confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties
1|here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can't make it out. Mack
1|loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl
1|give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kutuzov alone at
1|last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the invincibility
1|of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care to hear
1|the details."
1|
1|"That's just it, my dear fellow. You see it's hurrah for the Tsar,
1|for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but
1|what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories?
1|Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one
1|archduke's as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only
1|over a fire brigade of Bonaparte's, that will be another story and
1|we'll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on
1|purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke
1|Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its
1|defense--as much as to say: 'Heaven is with us, but heaven help you
1|and your capital!' The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you
1|expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit
1|that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived.
1|It's as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose
1|you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a
1|victory, what effect would that have on the general course of
1|events? It's too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!"
1|
1|"What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?"
1|
1|"Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn, and the count,
1|our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders."
1|
1|After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception,
1|and especially after having dined, Bolkonski felt that he could not
1|take in the full significance of the words he heard.
1|
1|"Count Lichtenfels was here this morning," Bilibin continued, "and
1|showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was
1|fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that
1|your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can't be
1|received as a savior."
1|
1|"Really I don't care about that, I don't care at all," said Prince
1|Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before
1|Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the
1|fall of Austria's capital. "How is it Vienna was taken? What of the
1|bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard
1|reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?" he said.
1|
1|"Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is
1|defending us--doing it very badly, I think, but still he is
1|defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has
1|not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and
1|orders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago
1|have been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would
1|have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires."
1|
1|"But still this does not mean that the campaign is over," said
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they
1|daren't say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign,
1|it won't be your skirmishing at Durrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that
1|will decide the matter, but those who devised it," said Bilibin
1|quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead,
1|and pausing. "The only question is what will come of the meeting
1|between the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If
1|Prussia joins the Allies, Austria's hand will be forced and there will
1|be war. If not it is merely a question of settling where the
1|preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up."
1|
1|"What an extraordinary genius!" Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,
1|clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, "and what
1|luck the man has!"
1|
1|"Buonaparte?" said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to
1|indicate that he was about to say something witty. "Buonaparte?" he
1|repeated, accentuating the u: "I think, however, now that he lays down
1|laws for Austria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l'u!* I
1|shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!"
1|
1|
1|*"We must let him off the u!"
1|
1|
1|"But joking apart," said Prince Andrew, "do you really think the
1|campaign is over?"
1|
1|"This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is
1|not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the
1|first place because her provinces have been pillaged--they say the
1|Holy Russian army loots terribly--her army is destroyed, her capital
1|taken, and all this for the beaux yeux* of His Sardinian Majesty.
1|And therefore--this is between ourselves--I instinctively feel that we
1|are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France
1|and projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately."
1|
1|
1|*Fine eyes.
1|
1|
1|"Impossible!" cried Prince Andrew. "That would be too base."
1|
1|"If we live we shall see," replied Bilibin, his face again
1|becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.
1|
1|When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in
1|a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows,
1|he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far
1|away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria's treachery,
1|Bonaparte's new triumph, tomorrow's levee and parade, and the audience
1|with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.
1|
1|He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of
1|musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his
1|ears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were
1|descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart
1|palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily
1|whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as
1|he had not done since childhood.
1|
1|He woke up...
1|
1|"Yes, that all happened!" he said, and, smiling happily to himself
1|like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first
1|thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be
1|presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War,
1|the polite Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night's
1|conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full
1|parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into
1|Bilibin's study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged.
1|In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With
1|Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, who was a secretary to the embassy,
1|Bolkonski was already acquainted. Bilibin introduced him to the
1|others.
1|
1|The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin's were young, wealthy, gay
1|society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which
1|Bilibin, their leader, called les notres.* This set, consisting almost
1|exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had
1|nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to
1|certain women, and to the official side of the service. These
1|gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they
1|did not extend to many. From politeness and to start conversation,
1|they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then
1|the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.
1|
1|
1|*Ours.
1|
1|
1|"But the best of it was," said one, telling of the misfortune of a
1|fellow diplomat, "that the Chancellor told him flatly that his
1|appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.
1|Can you fancy the figure he cut?..."
1|
1|"But the worst of it, gentlemen--I am giving Kuragin away to you--is
1|that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking
1|advantage of it!"
1|
1|Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over
1|its arm. He began to laugh.
1|
1|"Tell me about that!" he said.
1|
1|"Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!" cried several voices.
1|
1|"You, Bolkonski, don't know," said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew,
1|"that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the
1|Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing
1|among the women!"
1|
1|"La femme est la compagne de l'homme,"* announced Prince
1|Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.
1|
1|
1|*"Woman is man's companion."
1|
1|
1|Bilibin and the rest of "ours" burst out laughing in Hippolyte's
1|face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom--he had to
1|admit--he had almost been jealous on his wife's account, was the
1|butt of this set.
1|
1|"Oh, I must give you a treat," Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski.
1|"Kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics--you should see his
1|gravity!"
1|
1|He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began
1|talking to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered
1|round these two.
1|
1|"The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance," began
1|Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, "without
1|expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless
1|His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our
1|alliance...
1|
1|"Wait, I have not finished..." he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him
1|by the arm, "I believe that intervention will be stronger than
1|nonintervention. And..." he paused. "Finally one cannot impute the
1|nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end."
1|And he released Bolkonski's arm to indicate that he had now quite
1|finished.
1|
1|"Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
1|mouth!" said Bilibin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with
1|satisfaction.
1|
1|Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was
1|evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain
1|the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.
1|
1|"Well now, gentlemen," said Bilibin, "Bolkonski is my guest in
1|this house and in Brunn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I
1|can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it
1|would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more
1|difficult, and I beg you all to help me. Brunn's attractions must be
1|shown him. You can undertake the theater, I society, and you,
1|Hippolyte, of course the women."
1|
1|"We must let him see Amelie, she's exquisite!" said one of "ours,"
1|kissing his finger tips.
1|
1|"In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
1|interests," said Bilibin.
1|
1|"I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,
1|gentlemen, it is already time for me to go," replied Prince Andrew
1|looking at his watch.
1|
1|"Where to?"
1|
1|"To the Emperor."
1|
1|"Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, au revoir, Bolkonski! Au revoir, Prince! Come
1|back early to dinner," cried several voices. "We'll take you in hand."
1|
1|"When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the
1|way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated," said
1|Bilibin, accompanying him to the hall.
1|
1|"I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,
1|I can't," replied Bolkonski, smiling.
1|
1|"Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for
1|giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can't do
1|it, as you will see."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had
1|been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his
1|face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was over,
1|the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
1|Bolkonski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The
1|Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room.
1|Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact
1|that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to
1|say.
1|
1|"Tell me, when did the battle begin?" he asked hurriedly.
1|
1|Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:
1|"Was Kutuzov well? When had he left Krems?" and so on. The Emperor
1|spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions--the
1|answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest
1|him.
1|
1|"At what o'clock did the battle begin?" asked the Emperor.
1|
1|"I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o'clock the battle began at
1|the front, but at Durrenstein, where I was, our attack began after
1|five in the afternoon," replied Bolkonski growing more animated and
1|expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account,
1|which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the
1|Emperor smiled and interrupted him.
1|
1|"How many miles?"
1|
1|"From where to where, Your Majesty?"
1|
1|"From Durrenstein to Krems."
1|
1|"Three and a half miles, Your Majesty."
1|
1|"The French have abandoned the left bank?"
1|
1|"According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during
1|the night."
1|
1|"Is there sufficient forage in Krems?"
1|
1|"Forage has not been supplied to the extent..."
1|
1|The Emperor interrupted him.
1|
1|"At what o'clock was General Schmidt killed?"
1|
1|"At seven o'clock, I believe."
1|
1|"At seven o'clock? It's very sad, very sad!"
1|
1|The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew
1|withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides.
1|Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday's
1|adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and
1|offered him his own house. The Minister of War came up and
1|congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which
1|the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress' chamberlain invited
1|him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did
1|not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts.
1|Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the
1|window, and began to talk to him.
1|
1|Contrary to Bilibin's forecast the news he had brought was
1|joyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutuzov was
1|awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army
1|received rewards. Bolkonski was invited everywhere, and had to spend
1|the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries.
1|Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls,
1|he was returning to Bilibin's house thinking out a letter to his
1|father about the battle and his visit to Brunn. At the door he found a
1|vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilibin's man, was dragging a
1|portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.
1|
1|Before returning to Bilibin's Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop
1|to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent
1|some time in the shop.
1|
1|"What is it?" he asked.
1|
1|"Oh, your excellency!" said Franz, with difficulty rolling the
1|portmanteau into the vehicle, "we are to move on still farther. The
1|scoundrel is again at our heels!"
1|
1|"Eh? What?" asked Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Bilibin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed
1|excitement.
1|
1|"There now! Confess that this is delightful," said he. "This
1|affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without
1|striking a blow!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew could not understand.
1|
1|"But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the
1|town knows?"
1|
1|"I come from the archduchess'. I heard nothing there."
1|
1|"And you didn't see that everybody is packing up?"
1|
1|"I did not... What is it all about?" inquired Prince Andrew
1|impatiently.
1|
1|"What's it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that
1|Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat
1|is now rushing along the road to Brunn and will be here in a day or
1|two."
1|
1|"What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was
1|mined?"
1|
1|"That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why."
1|
1|Bolkonski shrugged his shoulders.
1|
1|"But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It
1|will be cut off," said he.
1|
1|"That's just it," answered Bilibin. "Listen! The French entered
1|Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday,
1|those gentlemen, messieurs les marechaux,* Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,
1|mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)
1|'Gentlemen,' says one of them, 'you know the Thabor Bridge is mined
1|and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its
1|head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up
1|the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign
1|the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and
1|take it!' 'Yes, let's!' say the others. And off they go and take the
1|bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of
1|the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication."
1|
1|
1|*The marshalls.
1|
1|
1|"Stop jesting," said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news
1|grieved him and yet he was pleased.
1|
1|As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
1|situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead
1|it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift
1|him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to
1|fame! Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching
1|the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be
1|the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be
1|entrusted with the executing of the plan.
1|
1|"Stop this jesting," he said
1|
1|"I am not jesting," Bilibin went on. "Nothing is truer or sadder.
1|These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white
1|handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the
1|marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets
1|them enter the tete-de-pont.* They spin him a thousand gasconades,
1|saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a
1|meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg,
1|and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace
1|the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French
1|battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary
1|material into the water, and approaches the tete-de-pont. At length
1|appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von
1|Mautern himself. 'Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of
1|the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another's
1|hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince
1|Auersperg's acquaintance.' In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed,
1|so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his
1|rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so
1|dazzled by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich plumes, qu'il n'y
1|voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur
1|l'ennemi!"*[2] In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilibin did
1|not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due
1|appreciation. "The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes
1|the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all," he went
1|on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his
1|own story, "is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was
1|to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this
1|sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the
1|bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant,
1|who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and
1|says: 'Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!' Murat,
1|seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns
1|to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says:
1|'I don't recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you
1|allow a subordinate to address you like that!' It was a stroke of
1|genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the
1|sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair of the
1|Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor
1|rascality...."
1|
1|
1|*Bridgehead.
1|
1|*[2] That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought
1|to be firing at the enemy.
1|
1|
1|"It may be treachery," said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the
1|gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of
1|firing, and the glory that awaited him.
1|
1|"Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light," replied
1|Bilibin. "It's not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as
1|at Ulm... it is..."--he seemed to be trying to find the right
1|expression. "C'est... c'est du Mack. Nous sommes mackes [It is... it
1|is a bit of Mack. We are Macked]," he concluded, feeling that he had
1|produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His
1|hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a
1|slight smile he began to examine his nails.
1|
1|"Where are you off to?" he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had
1|risen and was going toward his room.
1|
1|"I am going away."
1|
1|"Where to?"
1|
1|"To the army."
1|
1|"But you meant to stay another two days?"
1|
1|"But now I am off at once."
1|
1|And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went
1|to his room.
1|
1|"Do you know, mon cher," said Bilibin following him, "I have been
1|thinking about you. Why are you going?"
1|
1|And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
1|vanished from his face.
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.
1|
1|"Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back
1|to the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher,
1|it is heroism!"
1|
1|"Not at all," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the
1|other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the
1|contrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no
1|longer fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to return
1|and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and
1|go with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to
1|Olmutz, and Olmutz is a very decent town. You and I will travel
1|comfortably in my caleche."
1|
1|"Do stop joking, Bilibin," cried Bolkonski.
1|
1|"I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are
1|you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two
1|things," and the skin over his left temple puckered, "either you
1|will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will
1|share defeat and disgrace with Kutuzov's whole army."
1|
1|And Bilibin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was
1|insoluble.
1|
1|"I cannot argue about it," replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he
1|thought: "I am going to save the army."
1|
1|"My dear fellow, you are a hero!" said Bilibin.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War,
1|Bolkonski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would
1|find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.
1|
1|In Brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the
1|heavy baggage was already being dispatched to Olmutz. Near Hetzelsdorf
1|Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was
1|moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was
1|so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a
1|carriage. Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack
1|commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage
1|wagons, rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own
1|luggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him
1|as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly
1|flight confirmed these rumors.
1|
1|"Cette armee russe que l'or de l'Angleterre a transportee des
1|extremites de l'univers, nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme
1|sort--(le sort de l'armee d'Ulm)."* He remembered these words in
1|Bonaparte's address to his army at the beginning of the campaign,
1|and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a
1|feeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. "And should there be
1|nothing left but to die?" he thought. "Well, if need be, I shall do it
1|no worse than others."
1|
1|
1|*"That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the
1|earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same fate--(the
1|fate of the army at Ulm)."
1|
1|
1|He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of
1|detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and
1|vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy
1|road, three and sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and
1|before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels,
1|the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the
1|crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of
1|soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road
1|fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and
1|broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for
1|something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies,
1|crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from
1|them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each ascent
1|or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of
1|shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud
1|pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,
1|traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers
1|directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their
1|voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their
1|faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this
1|disorder.
1|
1|"Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army," thought Bolkonski,
1|recalling Bilibin's words.
1|
1|Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up
1|to a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse
1|vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available
1|materials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet,
1|and a caleche. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in
1|shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle.
1|Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier
1|when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the
1|woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was beating
1|the soldier who was driving the woman's vehicle for trying to get
1|ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of
1|the equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew
1|she leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from
1|under the woolen shawl, cried:
1|
1|"Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven's sake... Protect
1|me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh
1|Chasseurs.... They won't let us pass, we are left behind and have lost
1|our people..."
1|
1|"I'll flatten you into a pancake!" shouted the angry officer to
1|the soldier. "Turn back with your slut!"
1|
1|"Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?" screamed
1|the doctor's wife.
1|
1|"Kindly let this cart pass. Don't you see it's a woman?" said Prince
1|Andrew riding up to the officer.
1|
1|The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the
1|soldier. "I'll teach you to push on!... Back!"
1|
1|"Let them pass, I tell you!" repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his
1|lips.
1|
1|"And who are you?" cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy
1|rage, "who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander
1|here, not you! Go back or I'll flatten you into a pancake," repeated
1|he. This expression evidently pleased him.
1|
1|"That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp," came a voice
1|from behind.
1|
1|Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,
1|tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his
1|championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might expose him
1|to what he dreaded more than anything in the world--to ridicule; but
1|his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence
1|Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised
1|his riding whip.
1|
1|"Kind...ly let--them--pass!"
1|
1|The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.
1|
1|"It's all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there's
1|this disorder," he muttered. "Do as you like."
1|
1|Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
1|doctor's wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a
1|sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
1|galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in
1|chief was.
1|
1|On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,
1|intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to
1|sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his
1|mind. "This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army," he was thinking
1|as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar
1|voice called him by name.
1|
1|He turned round. Nesvitski's handsome face looked out of the
1|little window. Nesvitski, moving his moist lips as he chewed
1|something, and flourishing his arm, called him to enter.
1|
1|"Bolkonski! Bolkonski!... Don't you hear? Eh? Come quick..." he
1|shouted.
1|
1|Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvitski and another adjutant
1|having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he
1|had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.
1|This was particularly noticeable on Nesvitski's usually laughing
1|countenance.
1|
1|"Where is the commander in chief?" asked Bolkonski.
1|
1|"Here, in that house," answered the adjutant.
1|
1|"Well, is it true that it's peace and capitulation?" asked
1|Nesvitski.
1|
1|"I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I
1|could do to get here."
1|
1|"And we, my dear boy! It's terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,
1|we're getting it still worse," said Nesvitski. "But sit down and
1|have something to eat."
1|
1|"You won't be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,
1|Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is," said the other
1|adjutant.
1|
1|"Where are headquarters?"
1|
1|"We are to spend the night in Znaim."
1|
1|"Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses," said
1|Nesvitski. "They've made up splendid packs for me--fit to cross the
1|Bohemian mountains with. It's a bad lookout, old fellow! But what's
1|the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that," he added,
1|noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.
1|
1|"It's nothing," replied Prince Andrew.
1|
1|He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor's wife
1|and the convoy officer.
1|
1|"What is the commander in chief doing here?" he asked.
1|
1|"I can't make out at all," said Nesvitski.
1|
1|"Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable,
1|abominable, quite abominable!" said Prince Andrew, and he went off
1|to the house where the commander in chief was.
1|
1|Passing by Kutuzov's carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his
1|suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince
1|Andrew entered the passage. Kutuzov himself, he was told, was in the
1|house with Prince Bagration and Weyrother. Weyrother was the
1|Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little
1|Kozlovski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk,
1|with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom
1|upwards. Kozlovski's face looked worn--he too had evidently not
1|slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to
1|him.
1|
1|"Second line... have you written it?" he continued dictating to
1|the clerk. "The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian..."
1|
1|"One can't write so fast, your honor," said the clerk, glancing
1|angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlovski.
1|
1|Through the door came the sounds of Kutuzov's voice, excited and
1|dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the
1|sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlovski looked at him,
1|the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the
1|clerk and Kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to
1|the commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks
1|holding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that
1|something important and disastrous was about to happen.
1|
1|He turned to Kozlovski with urgent questions.
1|
1|"Immediately, Prince," said Kozlovski. "Dispositions for Bagration."
1|
1|"What about capitulation?"
1|
1|"Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle."
1|
1|Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.
1|Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened,
1|and Kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the
1|doorway. Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutuzov but the
1|expression of the commander in chief's one sound eye showed him to
1|be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of
1|his presence. He looked straight at his adjutant's face without
1|recognizing him.
1|
1|"Well, have you finished?" said he to Kozlovski.
1|
1|"One moment, your excellency."
1|
1|Bagration, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,
1|impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in
1|chief.
1|
1|"I have the honor to present myself," repeated Prince Andrew
1|rather loudly, handing Kutuzov an envelope.
1|
1|"Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!"
1|
1|Kutuzov went out into the porch with Bagration.
1|
1|"Well, good-by, Prince," said he to Bagration. "My blessing, and may
1|Christ be with you in your great endeavor!"
1|
1|His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his
1|left hand he drew Bagration toward him, and with his right, on which
1|he wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a
1|gesture evidently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagration
1|kissed him on the neck instead.
1|
1|"Christ be with you!" Kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage.
1|"Get in with me," said he to Bolkonski.
1|
1|"Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to
1|remain with Prince Bagration's detachment."
1|
1|"Get in," said Kutuzov, and noticing that Bolkonski still delayed,
1|he added: "I need good officers myself, need them myself!"
1|
1|They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.
1|
1|"There is still much, much before us," he said, as if with an old
1|man's penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkonski's
1|mind. "If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,"
1|he added as if speaking to himself.
1|
1|Prince Andrew glanced at Kutuzov's face only a foot distant from him
1|and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar
1|near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the
1|empty eye socket. "Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those
1|men's death," thought Bolkonski.
1|
1|"That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment," he said.
1|
1|Kutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had
1|been saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently
1|swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince
1|Andrew. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With
1|delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his
1|interview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court
1|concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|On November 1 Kutuzov had received, through a spy, news that the
1|army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported
1|that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing
1|in immense force upon Kutuzov's line of communication with the
1|troops that were arriving from Russia. If Kutuzov decided to remain at
1|Krems, Napoleon's army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut
1|him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty
1|thousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If
1|Kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops
1|arriving from Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown
1|parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior
1|forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with
1|Buxhowden. If Kutuzov decided to retreat along the road from Krems
1|to Olmutz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked
1|being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the
1|Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having
1|to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as
1|strong, who would hem him in from two sides.
1|
1|Kutuzov chose this latter course.
1|
1|The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were
1|advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles
1|off on the line of Kutuzov's retreat. If he reached Znaim before the
1|French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the
1|French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army
1|to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to
1|forestall the French with his whole army was impossible. The road
1|for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the
1|road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.
1|
1|The night he received the news, Kutuzov sent Bagration's vanguard,
1|four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the
1|Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march
1|without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and
1|if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as
1|long as possible. Kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road
1|to Znaim.
1|
1|Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills,
1|with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as
1|stragglers by the way, Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim road
1|at Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching
1|Hollabrunn from Vienna. Kutuzov with his transport had still to
1|march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration
1|with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain
1|for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrunn,
1|which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the
1|impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the
1|Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat
1|to try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagration's weak
1|detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzov's whole
1|army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of
1|the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with
1|this object offered a three days' truce on condition that both
1|armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that
1|negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he
1|therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count
1|Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed
1|Murat's emissary and retired, leaving Bagration's division exposed.
1|Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace
1|negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days' truce.
1|Bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or
1|refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to report the offer he
1|had received.
1|
1|A truce was Kutuzov's sole chance of gaining time, giving
1|Bagration's exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport
1|and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French)
1|advance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the
1|only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On
1|receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General
1|Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp.
1|Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer
1|terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants back
1|to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the
1|entire army along the Krems-Znaim road. Bagration's exhausted and
1|hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the
1|transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of
1|an enemy eight times as strong as itself.
1|
1|Kutuzov's expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which
1|were in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to
1|pass, and also that Murat's mistake would very soon be discovered,
1|proved correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schonbrunn, sixteen
1|miles from Hollabrunn) received Murat's dispatch with the proposal
1|of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the
1|following letter to Murat:
1|
1|
1|Schonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,
1|
1|at eight o'clock in the morning
1|
1|To PRINCE MURAT,
1|
1|I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command
1|only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice
1|without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign.
1|Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him
1|that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so,
1|and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.
1|
1|If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I
1|will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the
1|Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and
1|artillery.
1|
1|The Russian Emperor's aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are
1|nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The
1|Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna
1|bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of
1|the Emperor.
1|
1|NAPOLEON
1|
1|
1|Bonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
1|Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all
1|the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim
1|escape, and Bagration's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,
1|dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first
1|time for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was
1|in store for him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who
1|had persisted in his request to Kutuzov, arrived at Grunth and
1|reported himself to Bagration. Bonaparte's adjutant had not yet
1|reached Murat's detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In
1|Bagration's detachment no one knew anything of the general position of
1|affairs. They talked of peace but did not believe in its
1|possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the
1|nearness of an engagement. Bagration, knowing Bolkonski to be a
1|favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and
1|special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be
1|an engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to
1|remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an
1|eye on the order of retreat, "which is also very important."
1|
1|"However, there will hardly be an engagement today," said
1|Bagration as if to reassure Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a
1|medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he
1|wishes to stay with me, let him... he'll be of use here if he's a
1|brave officer," thought Bagration. Prince Andrew, without replying,
1|asked the prince's permission to ride round the position to see the
1|disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be
1|sent to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly
1|dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of
1|speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince
1|Andrew.
1|
1|On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who
1|seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors,
1|benches, and fencing from the village.
1|
1|"There now, Prince! We can't stop those fellows," said the staff
1|officer pointing to the soldiers. "The officers don't keep them in
1|hand. And there," he pointed to a sutler's tent, "they crowd in and
1|sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, it's full again.
1|I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won't take a
1|moment."
1|
1|"Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,"
1|said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.
1|
1|"Why didn't you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you
1|something."
1|
1|They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed
1|and weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.
1|
1|"Now what does this mean, gentlemen?" said the staff officer, in the
1|reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than
1|once. "You know it won't do to leave your posts like this. The
1|prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,
1|Captain," and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer
1|who without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to
1|dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not
1|altogether comfortably.
1|
1|"Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself, Captain Tushin?" he
1|continued. "One would think that as an artillery officer you would set
1|a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be
1|sounded and you'll be in a pretty position without your boots!" (The
1|staff officer smiled.) "Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of
1|you, all!" he added in a tone of command.
1|
1|Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery
1|officer Tushin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged
1|foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent,
1|kindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.
1|
1|"The soldiers say it feels easier without boots," said Captain
1|Tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently
1|wishing to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt
1|that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.
1|
1|"Kindly return to your posts," said the staff officer trying to
1|preserve his gravity.
1|
1|Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer's small figure.
1|There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather
1|comic, but extremely attractive.
1|
1|The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode
1|on.
1|
1|Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking
1|soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left
1|some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which
1|showed up red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt
1|sleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host
1|of white ants; spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown
1|up from behind the bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer
1|rode up, looked at the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it
1|they came upon some dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by
1|others, who ran from the entrenchment. They had to hold their noses
1|and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned
1|atmosphere of these latrines.
1|
1|"Voila l'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince,"* said the staff
1|officer.
1|
1|
1|*"This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince."
1|
1|
1|They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could
1|already be seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the
1|position.
1|
1|"That's our battery," said the staff officer indicating the
1|highest point. "It's in charge of the queer fellow we saw without
1|his boots. You can see everything from there; let's go there, Prince."
1|
1|"Thank you very much, I will go on alone," said Prince Andrew,
1|wishing to rid himself of this staff officer's company, "please
1|don't trouble yourself further."
1|
1|The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.
1|
1|The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly
1|and cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had
1|been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road
1|seven miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and
1|alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French
1|lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops. The
1|soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major
1|and company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in
1|each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers
1|scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and
1|were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the
1|fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg
1|bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and
1|porridge cookers. In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers
1|were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample,
1|which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an
1|officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted.
1|
1|Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,
1|crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who,
1|tilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to
1|him. The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with
1|reverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths,
1|and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions,
1|licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats.
1|All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home
1|awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before
1|an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field.
1|After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev
1|grenadiers--fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs--near
1|the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different
1|from the others, Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of
1|grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while
1|two others were flourishing their switches and striking him
1|regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout
1|major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams
1|kept repeating:
1|
1|"It's a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,
1|honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor
1|in him, he's a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!"
1|
1|So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but
1|unnatural screams, continued.
1|
1|"Go on, go on!" said the major.
1|
1|A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his
1|face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the
1|adjutant as he rode by.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our
1|front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and
1|left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce
1|had passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the
1|men could see one another's faces and speak to one another. Besides
1|the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, there were
1|many curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared at their
1|strange foreign enemies.
1|
1|Since early morning--despite an injunction not to approach the
1|picket line--the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away.
1|The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a
1|curiosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the
1|sight-seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew
1|halted to have a look at the French.
1|
1|"Look! Look there!" one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a
1|Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer
1|and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. "Hark
1|to him jabbering! Fine, isn't it? It's all the Frenchy can do to
1|keep up with him. There now, Sidorov!"
1|
1|"Wait a bit and listen. It's fine!" answered Sidorov, who was
1|considered an adept at French.
1|
1|The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov. Prince
1|Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying.
1|Dolokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was
1|stationed, with his captain.
1|
1|"Now then, go on, go on!" incited the officer, bending forward and
1|trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible
1|to him. "More, please: more! What's he saying?"
1|
1|Dolokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot
1|dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about
1|the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the
1|Russians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and
1|had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dolokhov maintained that the
1|Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.
1|
1|"We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you
1|off," said Dolokhov.
1|
1|"Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!" said
1|the French grenadier.
1|
1|The French onlookers and listeners laughed.
1|
1|"We'll make you dance as we did under Suvorov...,"* said Dolokhov.
1|
1|
1|*"On vous fera danser."
1|
1|
1|"Qu' est-ce qu'il chante?"* asked a Frenchman.
1|
1|
1|*"What's he singing about?"
1|
1|
1|"It's ancient history," said another, guessing that it referred to a
1|former war. "The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the
1|others..."
1|
1|"Bonaparte..." began Dolokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.
1|
1|"Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacre nom...!" cried he angrily.
1|
1|"The devil skin your Emperor."
1|
1|And Dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldier's Russian and
1|shouldering his musket walked away.
1|
1|"Let us go, Ivan Lukich," he said to the captain.
1|
1|"Ah, that's the way to talk French," said the picket soldiers. "Now,
1|Sidorov, you have a try!"
1|
1|Sidorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber
1|meaningless sounds very fast: "Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter,
1|Kaska," he said, trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.
1|
1|"Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!" came peals of such healthy and
1|good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French
1|involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be
1|to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as
1|quickly as possible.
1|
1|But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and
1|entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon
1|confronted one another as before.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left,
1|Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff
1|officer had told him the whole field could be seen. Here he
1|dismounted, and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered
1|cannon. Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he
1|stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his
1|measured, monotonous pacing. Behind the guns were their limbers and
1|still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen's bonfires. To the
1|left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed
1|wattle shed from which came the sound of officers' voices in eager
1|conversation.
1|
1|It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and
1|the greater part of the enemy's opened out from this battery. Just
1|facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schon
1|Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the
1|French troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of
1|whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To
1|the left from that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a
1|battery, but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye.
1|Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated
1|the French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the
1|farthest point the dragoons. In the center, where Tushin's battery
1|stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the
1|easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating
1|us from Schon Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse,
1|in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood.
1|The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they
1|could easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a
1|steep and deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to
1|retire. Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the
1|cannon, sketched a plan of the position. He made some notes on two
1|points, intending to mention them to Bagration. His idea was, first,
1|to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to
1|withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew,
1|being always near the commander in chief, closely following the mass
1|movements and general orders, and constantly studying historical
1|accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the course of
1|events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined only
1|important possibilities: "If the enemy attacks the right flank," he
1|said to himself, "the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must
1|hold their position till reserves from the center come up. In that
1|case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack. If
1|they attack our center we, having the center battery on this high
1|ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat
1|to the dip by echelons." So he reasoned.... All the time he had been
1|beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly,
1|but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were
1|saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the
1|shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.
1|
1|"No, friend," said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew,
1|a familiar voice, "what I say is that if it were possible to know what
1|is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That's so, friend."
1|
1|Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: "Afraid or not, you can't
1|escape it anyhow."
1|
1|"All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people," said a third
1|manly voice interrupting them both. "Of course you artillery men are
1|very wise, because you can take everything along with you--vodka and
1|snacks."
1|
1|And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,
1|laughed.
1|
1|"Yes, one is afraid," continued the first speaker, he of the
1|familiar voice. "One is afraid of the unknown, that's what it is.
1|Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there
1|is no sky but only an atmosphere."
1|
1|The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.
1|
1|"Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin," it said.
1|
1|"Why," thought Prince Andrew, "that's the captain who stood up in
1|the sutler's hut without his boots." He recognized the agreeable,
1|philosophizing voice with pleasure.
1|
1|"Some herb vodka? Certainly!" said Tushin. "But still, to conceive a
1|future life..."
1|
1|He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air;
1|nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon
1|ball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded
1|into the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing up a
1|mass of earth. The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.
1|
1|And immediately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth
1|and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed
1|followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer
1|who hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.
1|

1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,
1|looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes
1|ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto
1|motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a
1|battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two
1|mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A
1|small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,
1|probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had
1|not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a
1|report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and
1|galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagration. He heard the
1|cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our
1|guns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the
1|parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.
1|
1|Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte's stern
1|letter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at
1|once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the
1|Russian wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the
1|Emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.
1|
1|"It has begun. Here it is!" thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood
1|rush to his heart. "But where and how will my Toulon present itself?"
1|
1|Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and
1|drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same
1|rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets
1|ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that
1|filled his heart. "It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but
1|enjoyable!" was what the face of each soldier and each officer
1|seemed to say.
1|
1|Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up,
1|he saw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming
1|toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and
1|riding a white horse, was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrew stopped,
1|waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagration reined in his horse and
1|recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while
1|Prince Andrew told him what he had seen.
1|
1|The feeling, "It has begun! Here it is!" was seen even on Prince
1|Bagration's hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.
1|Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face
1|and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking
1|and feeling at that moment. "Is there anything at all behind that
1|impassive face?" Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince
1|Bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew
1|told him, and said, "Very good!" in a tone that seemed to imply that
1|everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he
1|had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride,
1|spoke quickly. Prince Bagration, uttering his words with an Oriental
1|accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that
1|there was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the
1|direction of Tushin's battery. Prince Andrew followed with the
1|suite. Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, the
1|prince's personal adjutant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff
1|officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian--an
1|accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of
1|curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around
1|him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange
1|appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet
1|coat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer's saddle.
1|
1|"He wants to see a battle," said Zherkov to Bolkonski, pointing to
1|the accountant, "but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach
1|already."
1|
1|"Oh, leave off!" said the accountant with a beaming but rather
1|cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of
1|Zherkov's joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really
1|was.
1|
1|"It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince," said the staff officer.
1|(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing
1|a prince, but could not get it quite right.)
1|
1|By this time they were all approaching Tushin's battery, and a
1|ball struck the ground in front of them.
1|
1|"What's that that has fallen?" asked the accountant with a naive
1|smile.
1|
1|"A French pancake," answered Zherkov.
1|
1|"So that's what they hit with?" asked the accountant. "How awful!"
1|
1|He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished
1|speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which
1|suddenly ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a
1|Cossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant,
1|crashed to earth with his horse. Zherkov and the staff officer bent
1|over their saddles and turned their horses away. The accountant
1|stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with attentive
1|curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.
1|
1|Prince Bagration screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing
1|the cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to
1|say, "Is it worth while noticing trifles?" He reined in his horse with
1|the case of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged
1|his saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber
1|of a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story
1|of Suvorov giving his saber to Bagration in Italy, and the
1|recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had
1|reached the battery at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined
1|the battlefield.
1|
1|"Whose company?" asked Prince Bagration of an artilleryman
1|standing by the ammunition wagon.
1|
1|He asked, "Whose company?" but he really meant, "Are you
1|frightened here?" and the artilleryman understood him.
1|
1|"Captain Tushin's, your excellency!" shouted the red-haired,
1|freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.
1|
1|"Yes, yes," muttered Bagration as if considering something, and he
1|rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.
1|
1|As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and
1|his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they
1|could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly
1|back to its former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number
1|One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while
1|Number Two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon's
1|mouth. The short, round-shouldered Captain Tushin, stumbling over
1|the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the
1|general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.
1|
1|"Lift it two lines more and it will be just right," cried he in a
1|feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill suited to
1|his weak figure. "Number Two!" he squeaked. "Fire, Medvedev!"
1|
1|Bagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three fingers to his
1|cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military
1|salute but like a priest's benediction, approached the general. Though
1|Tushin's guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing
1|incendiary balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just
1|opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.
1|
1|No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire, but
1|after consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchenko, for whom he had
1|great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set
1|fire to the village. "Very good!" said Bagration in reply to the
1|officer's report, and began deliberately to examine the whole
1|battlefield extended before him. The French had advanced nearest on
1|our right. Below the height on which the Kiev regiment was
1|stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring
1|rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther to the
1|right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to
1|Bagration a French column that was outflanking us. To the left the
1|horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagration ordered two
1|battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank.
1|The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if
1|these battalions went away, the guns would remain without support.
1|Prince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked
1|at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer's
1|remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it. But
1|at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the
1|commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses
1|of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was
1|in disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince
1|Bagration bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off
1|at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with
1|orders to attack the French. But this adjutant returned half an hour
1|later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already
1|retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been
1|opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened
1|to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.
1|
1|"Very good!" said Bagration.
1|
1|As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also,
1|and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go
1|there himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in
1|command (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzov at
1|Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow
1|in the rear, as the right flank would probably not be able to
1|withstand the enemy's attack very long. About Tushin and the battalion
1|that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince
1|Andrew listened attentively to Bagration's colloquies with the
1|commanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his
1|surprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince
1|Bagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity,
1|by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not
1|by his direct command, at least in accord with his intentions.
1|Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to
1|chance and was independent of the commander's will, owing to the
1|tact Bagration showed, his presence was very valuable. Officers who
1|approached him with disturbed countenances became calm; soldiers and
1|officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and
1|were evidently anxious to display their courage before him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|Prince Bagration, having reached the highest point of our right
1|flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard
1|but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer
1|they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they
1|felt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet
1|wounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged
1|along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms. There was a
1|gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently
1|hit him in the throat or mouth. Another was walking sturdily by
1|himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm
1|which had just been hurt, while blood from it was streaming over his
1|greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been wounded and his
1|face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended
1|a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met
1|a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers were
1|ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general's
1|presence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them
1|rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an
1|officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of
1|retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagration rode up to the
1|ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning
1|the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked
1|with smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with
1|it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the
1|touchpans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were
1|firing, though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke
1|which there was no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and
1|whistling of bullets were often heard. "What is this?" thought
1|Prince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. "It can't be an
1|attack, for they are not moving; it can't be a square--for they are
1|not drawn up for that."
1|
1|The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a
1|pleasant smile--his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,
1|giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as
1|a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had
1|been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been
1|repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack had
1|been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had
1|occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know
1|what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to
1|him, and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been
1|repulsed or his regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at
1|the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all
1|over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had
1|shouted "Cavalry!" and our men had begun firing. They were still
1|firing, not at the cavalry which had disappeared, but at French
1|infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men.
1|Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what
1|he had desired and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to
1|bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had
1|just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on
1|Prince Bagration's face at this moment. It expressed the
1|concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who
1|on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water. The
1|dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of
1|profound thought. The round, steady, hawk's eyes looked before him
1|eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although
1|his movements were still slow and measured.
1|
1|The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration, entreating
1|him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.
1|"Please, your excellency, for God's sake!" he kept saying, glancing
1|for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him.
1|"There, you see!" and he drew attention to the bullets whistling,
1|singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the tone
1|of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who
1|has picked up an ax: "We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister
1|your hands." He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and
1|his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words.
1|The staff officer joined in the colonel's appeals, but Bagration did
1|not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to
1|give room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking,
1|the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising
1|wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible
1|hand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving about on it,
1|opened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French
1|column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground.
1|One could already see the soldiers' shaggy caps, distinguish the
1|officers from the men, and see the standard flapping against its
1|staff.
1|
1|"They march splendidly," remarked someone in Bagration's suite.
1|
1|The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The
1|clash would take place on this side of it...
1|
1|The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly
1|formed up and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the
1|laggards, came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order.
1|Before they had reached Bagration, the weighty tread of the mass of
1|men marching in step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to
1|Bagration, marched a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a
1|stupid and happy expression--the same man who had rushed out of the
1|wattle shed. At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how
1|dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander.
1|
1|With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly
1|with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to
1|his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with
1|the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He
1|carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and
1|not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and
1|now back at the men without losing step, his whole powerful body
1|turning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of his soul were
1|concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and
1|feeling that he was doing it well he was happy. "Left... left...
1|left..." he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in
1|time to this, with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers
1|burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of
1|these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each
1|alternate step, "Left... left... left..." A fat major skirted a
1|bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen
1|behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot,
1|panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the air,
1|flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fell into the
1|column to the measure of "Left... left!" "Close up!" came the
1|company commander's voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a
1|semicircle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old
1|trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside
1|the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a
1|hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the
1|regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear
1|left... left... left.
1|
1|"Well done, lads!" said Prince Bagration.
1|
1|"Glad to do our best, your ex'len-lency!" came a confused shout from
1|the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
1|Bagration as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: "We
1|know that ourselves!" Another, without looking round, as though
1|fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.
1|
1|The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.
1|
1|Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and
1|dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over
1|his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The
1|head of the French column, with its officers leading, appeared from
1|below the hill.
1|
1|"Forward, with God!" said Bagration, in a resolute, sonorous
1|voice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging
1|his arms, he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the
1|awkward gait of a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible
1|power was leading him forward, and experienced great happiness.
1|
1|The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside
1|Bagration, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets,
1|and even their faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who,
1|with gaitered legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with
1|difficulty.) Prince Bagration gave no further orders and silently
1|continued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after
1|another rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their
1|uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several of our men fell, among
1|them the round-faced officer who had marched so gaily and
1|complacently. But at the moment the first report was heard,
1|Bagration looked round and shouted, "Hurrah!"
1|
1|"Hurrah--ah!--ah!" rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and
1|passing Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular
1|but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
1|flank. In the center Tushin's forgotten battery, which had managed
1|to set fire to the Schon Grabern village, delayed the French
1|advance. The French were putting out the fire which the wind was
1|spreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the
1|center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was
1|hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed.
1|But our left--which consisted of the Azov and Podolsk infantry and the
1|Pavlograd hussars--was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by
1|superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion.
1|Bagration had sent Zherkov to the general commanding that left flank
1|with orders to retreat immediately.
1|
1|Zherkov, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse
1|about and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagration than his
1|courage failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it
1|was dangerous.
1|
1|Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where
1|the firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where
1|they could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.
1|
1|The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander
1|of the regiment Kutuzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which
1|Dolokhov was serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left
1|flank had been assigned to the commander of the Pavlograd regiment
1|in which Rostov was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two
1|commanders were much exasperated with one another and, long after
1|the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already
1|advancing, were engaged in discussion with the sole object of
1|offending one another. But the regiments, both cavalry and infantry,
1|were by no means ready for the impending action. From privates to
1|general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in
1|peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the horses and the
1|infantry collecting wood.
1|
1|"He higher iss dan I in rank," said the German colonel of the
1|hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, "so
1|let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars...
1|Bugler, sount ze retreat!"
1|
1|But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling
1|together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the
1|capotes of Lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the
1|milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The
1|general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky
1|steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and
1|rode to the Pavlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows
1|but with secret malevolence in their hearts.
1|
1|"Once again, Colonel," said the general, "I can't leave half my
1|men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you," he repeated, "to
1|occupy the position and prepare for an attack."
1|
1|"I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!"
1|suddenly replied the irate colonel. "If you vere in the cavalry..."
1|
1|"I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if
1|you are not aware of the fact..."
1|
1|"Quite avare, your excellency," suddenly shouted the colonel,
1|touching his horse and turning purple in the face. "Vill you be so
1|goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don't
1|vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!"
1|
1|"You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own
1|pleasure and I won't allow it to be said!"
1|
1|Taking the colonel's outburst as a challenge to his courage, the
1|general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front
1|line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the
1|bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and
1|they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the
1|line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that
1|it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken
1|ground, as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The
1|general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another
1|like two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to
1|detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination
1|successfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give
1|occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave
1|the range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time
1|testing each other's courage had it not been that just then they heard
1|the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the
1|wood. The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It
1|was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry.
1|They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the
1|French. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to
1|attack in order to cut away through for themselves.
1|
1|The squadron in which Rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount
1|before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,
1|there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that
1|terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear--resembling the line
1|separating the living from the dead--lay between them. All were
1|conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would
1|cross it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.
1|
1|The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to
1|questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately
1|insisting on having his own way, gave an order. No one said anything
1|definite, but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron.
1|The command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were
1|drawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The troops of the left
1|flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did not
1|himself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated itself
1|to the men.
1|
1|"If only they would be quick!" thought Rostov, feeling that at
1|last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which
1|he had so often heard from his fellow hussars.
1|
1|"Fo'ward, with God, lads!" rang out Denisov's voice. "At a twot
1|fo'ward!"
1|
1|The horses' croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at
1|the reins and started of his own accord.
1|
1|Before him, on the right, Rostov saw the front lines of his
1|hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see
1|distinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some
1|way off.
1|
1|"Faster!" came the word of command, and Rostov felt Rook's flanks
1|drooping as he broke into a gallop.
1|
1|Rostov anticipated his horse's movements and became more and more
1|elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had
1|been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible--and now he
1|had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but
1|everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. "Oh, how I
1|will slash at him!" thought Rostov, gripping the hilt of his saber.
1|
1|"Hur-a-a-a-ah!" came a roar of voices. "Let anyone come my way now,"
1|thought Rostov driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a
1|full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was
1|already visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep
1|over the squadron. Rostov raised his saber, ready to strike, but at
1|that instant the trooper Nikitenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away
1|from him, and Rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be
1|carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same
1|spot. From behind him Bondarchuk, an hussar he knew, jolted against
1|him and looked angrily at him. Bondarchuk's horse swerved and galloped
1|past.
1|
1|"How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!" Rostov
1|asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle
1|of a field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars' backs, he saw
1|nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around
1|him. There was warm blood under his arm. "No, I am wounded and the
1|horse is killed." Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back,
1|pinning his rider's leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled
1|but could not rise. Rostov also tried to rise but fell back, his
1|sabretache having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men
1|were, and where the French, he did not know. There was no one near.
1|
1|Having disentangled his leg, he rose. "Where, on which side, was now
1|the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?" he asked himself
1|and could not answer. "Can something bad have happened to me?" he
1|wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something
1|superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if
1|it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find
1|blood on it. "Ah, here are people coming," he thought joyfully, seeing
1|some men running toward him. "They will help me!" In front came a
1|man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,
1|and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running
1|behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among
1|the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar.
1|He was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.
1|
1|"It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will
1|take me too? Who are these men?" thought Rostov, scarcely believing
1|his eyes. "Can they be French?" He looked at the approaching
1|Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get
1|at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful
1|that he could not believe his eyes. "Who are they? Why are they
1|running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom
1|everyone is so fond of?" He remembered his mother's love for him,
1|and his family's, and his friends', and the enemy's intention to
1|kill him seemed impossible. "But perhaps they may do it!" For more
1|than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the
1|situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was
1|already so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And
1|the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding
1|his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostov. He seized his
1|pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran
1|with all his might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the
1|feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns
1|bridge, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One
1|single sentiment, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed
1|his whole being. Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field
1|with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then
1|turning his good-natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder
1|of terror went through him: "No, better not look," he thought, but
1|having reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had
1|fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed his
1|run to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade
1|farther back. Rostov paused. "No, there's some mistake," thought he.
1|"They can't have wanted to kill me." But at the same time, his left
1|arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He
1|could run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov
1|closed his eyes and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled
1|past him. He mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his
1|left hand with his right, and reached the bushes. Behind these were
1|some Russian sharpshooters.

1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the
1|outskirts of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting
1|mixed, and retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his
1|fear, uttered the senseless cry, "Cut off!" that is so terrible in
1|battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of
1|panic.
1|
1|"Surrounded! Cut off? We're lost!" shouted the fugitives.
1|
1|The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the
1|general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment,
1|and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years' service
1|who had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters
1|for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the
1|recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and
1|above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for
1|self-preservation, he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring
1|his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell
1|around, but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to know what
1|was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he
1|had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years'
1|service, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.
1|
1|Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind
1|the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and
1|descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides
1|the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of
1|soldiers attend to the voice of their commander, or would they,
1|disregarding him, continue their flight? Despite his desperate
1|shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his
1|furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former
1|self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued
1|to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders. The moral
1|hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating
1|in a panic.
1|
1|The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
1|powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at
1|that moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any
1|apparent reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and
1|Russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was
1|Timokhin's company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood
1|and, having lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French
1|unexpectedly. Timokhin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the
1|enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination
1|that, taken by surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets
1|and run. Dolokhov, running beside Timokhin, killed a Frenchman at
1|close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French
1|officer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the battalions
1|re-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half
1|were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to join
1|up, and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major
1|Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies
1|pass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the
1|commander's stirrup, almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a
1|bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was
1|bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung.
1|He had an officer's sword in his hand. The soldier was pale, his
1|blue eyes looked impudently into the commander's face, and his lips
1|were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving instructions
1|to Major Ekonomov, he could not help taking notice of the soldier.
1|
1|"Your excellency, here are two trophies," said Dolokhov, pointing to
1|the French sword and pouch. "I have taken an officer prisoner. I
1|stopped the company." Dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and
1|spoke in abrupt sentences. "The whole company can bear witness. I
1|beg you will remember this, your excellency!"
1|
1|"All right, all right," replied the commander, and turned to Major
1|Ekonomov.
1|
1|But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around
1|his head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.
1|
1|"A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your
1|excellency!"
1|
1|
1|Tushin's battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
1|action did Prince Bagration, still hearing the cannonade in the
1|center, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also,
1|to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the
1|supports attached to Tushin's battery had been moved away in the
1|middle of the action by someone's order, the battery had continued
1|firing and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could
1|not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing
1|from four quite undefended guns. On the contrary, the energetic action
1|of that battery led the French to suppose that here--in the
1|center--the main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had
1|attempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven
1|back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.
1|
1|Soon after Prince Bagration had left him, Tushin had succeeded in
1|setting fire to Schon Grabern.
1|
1|"Look at them scurrying! It's burning! Just see the smoke! Fine!
1|Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!" exclaimed the artillerymen,
1|brightening up.
1|
1|All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the
1|direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the
1|soldiers cried at each shot: "Fine! That's good! Look at it... Grand!"
1|The fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French
1|columns that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as
1|though in revenge for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the
1|right of the village and began firing them at Tushin's battery.
1|
1|In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in
1|successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed
1|this battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our
1|guns, one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a
1|munition-wagon driver's leg. Their spirits once roused were,
1|however, not diminished, but only changed character. The horses were
1|replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded were
1|carried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun
1|battery. Tushin's companion officer had been killed at the beginning
1|of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the
1|guns' crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still as
1|merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing
1|below them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.
1|
1|Little Tushin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly
1|to "refill my pipe for that one!" and then, scattering sparks from it,
1|ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the
1|French.
1|
1|"Smack at 'em, lads!" he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels
1|and working the screws himself.
1|
1|Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always
1|made him jump, Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from
1|gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders
1|about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones,
1|and shouting in his feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute.
1|His face grew more and more animated. Only when a man was killed or
1|wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at
1|the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting the
1|injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and,
1|as is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders
1|taller and twice as broad as their officer--all looked at their
1|commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the
1|expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs.
1|
1|Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
1|activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense
1|of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded
1|never occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more
1|elated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a
1|day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and
1|that the corner of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar
1|ground. Though he thought of everything, considered everything, and
1|did everything the best of officers could do in his position, he was
1|in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness.
1|
1|From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle
1|and thud of the enemy's cannon balls, from the flushed and
1|perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight
1|of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on
1|the enemy's side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking
1|the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these
1|things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his
1|brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure. The enemy's guns
1|were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs
1|were blown by an invisible smoker.
1|
1|"There... he's puffing again," muttered Tushin to himself, as a
1|small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left
1|by the wind.
1|
1|"Now look out for the ball... we'll throw it back."
1|
1|"What do you want, your honor?" asked an artilleryman, standing
1|close by, who heard him muttering.
1|
1|"Nothing... only a shell..." he answered.
1|
1|"Come along, our Matvevna!" he said to himself. "Matvevna"* was
1|the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which
1|was large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their
1|guns seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard
1|Number One of the second gun's crew was "uncle"; Tushin looked at
1|him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every
1|movement. The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now
1|diminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone's breathing. He
1|listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.
1|
1|
1|*Daughter of Matthew.
1|
1|
1|"Ah! Breathing again, breathing!" he muttered to himself.
1|
1|He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was
1|throwing cannon balls at the French with both hands.
1|
1|"Now then, Matvevna, dear old lady, don't let me down!" he was
1|saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice
1|called above his head: "Captain Tushin! Captain!"
1|
1|Tushin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had
1|turned him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping
1|voice:
1|
1|"Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you..."
1|
1|"Why are they down on me?" thought Tushin, looking in alarm at his
1|superior.
1|
1|"I... don't..." he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.
1|"I..."
1|
1|But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon
1|ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.
1|He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another
1|ball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.
1|
1|"Retire! All to retire!" he shouted from a distance.
1|
1|The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the
1|same order.
1|
1|It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the
1|space where Tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with
1|a broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed
1|horses. Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the
1|limbers lay several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he
1|approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the
1|mere thought of being afraid roused him again. "I cannot be afraid,"
1|thought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the
1|order and did not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns
1|removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together
1|with Tushin, stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from
1|the French, he attended to the removal of the guns.
1|
1|"A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off," said an
1|artilleryman to Prince Andrew. "Not like your honor!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin. They were both so busy as to
1|seem not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two
1|cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down
1|the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind),
1|Prince Andrew rode up to Tushin.
1|
1|"Well, till we meet again..." he said, holding out his hand to
1|Tushin.
1|
1|"Good-by, my dear fellow," said Tushin. "Dear soul! Good-by, my dear
1|fellow!" and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,
1|hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing
1|dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous.
1|The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on
1|the right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as Tushin with his guns,
1|continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range
1|of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the
1|staff, among them the staff officer and Zherkov, who had been twice
1|sent to Tushin's battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one
1|another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to
1|proceed, reprimanding and reproaching him. Tushin gave no orders, and,
1|silently--fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep
1|without knowing why--rode behind on his artillery nag. Though the
1|orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves
1|after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty
1|infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin's
1|wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on "Matvevna's"
1|carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one
1|hand with the other, came up to Tushin and asked for a seat.
1|
1|"Captain, for God's sake! I've hurt my arm," he said timidly. "For
1|God's sake... I can't walk. For God's sake!"
1|
1|It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift
1|and been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.
1|
1|"Tell them to give me a seat, for God's sake!"
1|
1|"Give him a seat," said Tushin. "Lay a cloak for him to sit on,
1|lad," he said, addressing his favorite soldier. "And where is the
1|wounded officer?"
1|
1|"He has been set down. He died," replied someone.
1|
1|"Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,
1|Antonov."
1|
1|The cadet was Rostov. With one hand he supported the other; he was
1|pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on
1|"Matvevna," the gun from which they had removed the dead officer.
1|The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his
1|breeches and arm.
1|
1|"What, are you wounded, my lad?" said Tushin, approaching the gun on
1|which Rostov sat.
1|
1|"No, it's a sprain."
1|
1|"Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?" inquired Tushin.
1|
1|"It was the officer, your honor, stained it," answered the
1|artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if
1|apologizing for the state of his gun.
1|
1|It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by
1|the infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they
1|halted. It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the
1|uniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly,
1|near by on the right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of
1|shot gleamed in the darkness. This was the last French attack and
1|was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses. They
1|all rushed out of the village again, but Tushin's guns could not move,
1|and the artillerymen, Tushin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances
1|as they awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking
1|eagerly, streamed out of a side street.
1|
1|"Not hurt, Petrov?" asked one.
1|
1|"We've given it 'em hot, mate! They won't make another push now,"
1|said another.
1|
1|"You couldn't see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows!
1|Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn't there something to
1|drink?"
1|
1|The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and
1|again in the complete darkness Tushin's guns moved forward, surrounded
1|by the humming infantry as by a frame.
1|
1|In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was
1|flowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and
1|the sound of hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and
1|voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other
1|sound in the darkness of the night. The gloom that enveloped the
1|army was filled with their groans, which seemed to melt into one
1|with the darkness of the night. After a while the moving mass became
1|agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite,
1|and said something in passing: "What did he say? Where to, now?
1|Halt, is it? Did he thank us?" came eager questions from all sides.
1|The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report
1|spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had
1|halted. All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.
1|
1|Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Tushin,
1|having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a
1|dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a
1|bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostov, too, dragged
1|himself to the fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering
1|shook his whole body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but
1|he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm, for which
1|he could find no satisfactory position. He kept closing his eyes and
1|then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red,
1|and at the feeble, round-shouldered figure of Tushin who was sitting
1|cross-legged like a Turk beside him. Tushin's large, kind, intelligent
1|eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostov, who saw
1|that Tushin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not.
1|
1|From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry,
1|who were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The
1|sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs moving in mud,
1|the crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous
1|rumble.
1|
1|It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through
1|the gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a
1|storm. Rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed
1|before and around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on
1|his heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.
1|
1|"You don't mind your honor?" he asked Tushin. "I've lost my company,
1|your honor. I don't know where... such bad luck!"
1|
1|With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came
1|up to the bonfire, and addressing Tushin asked him to have the guns
1|moved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers
1|rushed to the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately,
1|each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding
1|on to.
1|
1|"You picked it up?... I dare say! You're very smart!" one of them
1|shouted hoarsely.
1|
1|Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
1|band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.
1|
1|"Must one die like a dog?" said he.
1|
1|Tushin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier
1|ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.
1|
1|"A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you,
1|fellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire--we'll return it with
1|interest," said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.
1|
1|Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and
1|passed by the fire. One of them stumbled.
1|
1|"Who the devil has put the logs on the road?" snarled he.
1|
1|"He's dead--why carry him?" said another.
1|
1|"Shut up!"
1|
1|And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.
1|
1|"Still aching?" Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.
1|
1|"Yes."
1|
1|"Your honor, you're wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,"
1|said a gunner, coming up to Tushin.
1|
1|"Coming, friend."
1|
1|Tushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,
1|walked away from the fire.
1|
1|Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared
1|for him, Prince Bagration sat at dinner, talking with some
1|commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old
1|man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton
1|bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years,
1|flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with
1|the signet ring, and Zherkov, uneasily glancing at them all, and
1|Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering
1|eyes.
1|
1|In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French,
1|and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture,
1|shaking his head in perplexity--perhaps because the banner really
1|interested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was,
1|to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next
1|hut there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our
1|dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look at him. Prince
1|Bagration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into
1|details of the action and our losses. The general whose regiment had
1|been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the
1|action began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the men who were
1|woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had made a
1|bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French
1|troops.
1|
1|"When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was
1|disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: 'I'll let them come
1|on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion'--and
1|that's what I did."
1|
1|The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not
1|managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened.
1|Perhaps it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid
1|all that confusion what did or did not happen?
1|
1|"By the way, your excellency, I should inform you," he
1|continued--remembering Dolokhov's conversation with Kutuzov and his
1|last interview with the gentleman-ranker--"that Private Dolokhov, who
1|was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my
1|presence and particularly distinguished himself."
1|
1|"I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,"
1|chimed in Zherkov, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the
1|hussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry
1|officer. "They broke up two squares, your excellency."
1|
1|Several of those present smiled at Zherkov's words, expecting one of
1|his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the
1|glory of our arms and of the day's work, they assumed a serious
1|expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie
1|devoid of any foundation. Prince Bagration turned to the old colonel:
1|
1|"Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically:
1|infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were
1|abandoned in the center?" he inquired, searching with his eyes for
1|someone. (Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns on the left
1|flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the
1|very beginning of the action.) "I think I sent you?" he added, turning
1|to the staff officer on duty.
1|
1|"One was damaged," answered the staff officer, "and the other I
1|can't understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had
1|only just left.... It is true that it was hot there," he added,
1|modestly.
1|
1|Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close to the
1|village and had already been sent for.
1|
1|"Oh, but you were there?" said Prince Bagration, addressing Prince
1|Andrew.
1|
1|"Of course, we only just missed one another," said the staff
1|officer, with a smile to Bolkonski.
1|
1|"I had not the pleasure of seeing you," said Prince Andrew, coldly
1|and abruptly.
1|
1|All were silent. Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way
1|timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past
1|the generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always
1|was by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of
1|the banner and stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.
1|
1|"How was it a gun was abandoned?" asked Bagration, frowning, not
1|so much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom
1|Zherkov laughed loudest.
1|
1|Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his
1|guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive
1|present themselves to Tushin in all their horror. He had been so
1|excited that he had not thought about it until that moment. The
1|officers' laughter confused him still more. He stood before
1|Bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to
1|mutter: "I don't know... your excellency... I had no men... your
1|excellency."
1|
1|"You might have taken some from the covering troops."
1|
1|Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that
1|was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into
1|trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy who
1|has blundered looks at an examiner.
1|
1|The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagration, apparently not
1|wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture
1|to intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows
1|and his fingers twitched nervously.
1|
1|"Your excellency!" Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
1|voice," you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin's battery. I
1|went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two
1|guns smashed, and no supports at all."
1|
1|Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at
1|Bolkonski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.
1|
1|"And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion," he
1|continued, "we owe today's success chiefly to the action of that
1|battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company,"
1|and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.
1|
1|Prince Bagration looked at Tushin, evidently reluctant to show
1|distrust in Bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to
1|credit it, bent his head, and told Tushin that he could go. Prince
1|Andrew went out with him.
1|
1|"Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!" said Tushin.
1|
1|Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He
1|felt sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had
1|hoped.
1|
1|
1|"Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all
1|this end?" thought Rostov, looking at the changing shadows before him.
1|The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible
1|drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the
1|impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
1|with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers--wounded and
1|unwounded--it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting
1|the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder.
1|To rid himself of them he closed his eyes.
1|
1|For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things
1|appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand,
1|Sonya's thin little shoulders, Natasha's eyes and laughter, Denisov
1|with his voice and mustache, and Telyanin and all that affair with
1|Telyanin and Bogdanich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier
1|with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that
1|were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and
1|always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them,
1|but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair's
1|breadth. It would not ache--it would be well--if only they did not
1|pull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.
1|
1|He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung
1|less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling
1|snow were fluttering in that light. Tushin had not returned, the
1|doctor had not come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was
1|sitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow
1|body.
1|
1|"Nobody wants me!" thought Rostov. "There is no one to help me or
1|pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved." He
1|sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.
1|
1|"Eh, is anything hurting you?" asked the soldier, shaking his
1|shirt out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt
1|and added: "What a lot of men have been crippled today--frightful!"
1|
1|Rostov did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes
1|fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,
1|bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his
1|healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. "And why
1|did I come here?" he wondered.
1|
1|Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant
1|of Bagration's detachment was reunited to Kutuzov's army.

1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Prince Vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his
1|plans. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own
1|advantage. He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom
1|getting on had become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he
1|never rightly accounted to himself, but which formed the whole
1|interest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves in his
1|mind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met. Of these
1|plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only
1|beginning to form themselves, some approaching achievement, and some
1|in course of disintegration. He did not, for instance, say to himself:
1|"This man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship
1|and through him obtain a special grant." Nor did he say to himself:
1|"Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend
1|me the forty thousand rubles I need." But when he came across
1|a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this
1|man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vasili
1|took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become
1|intimate with him, and finally make his request.
1|
1|He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an
1|appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time
1|conferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the
1|young man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house.
1|With apparent absent-mindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance
1|that he was doing the right thing, Prince Vasili did everything to get
1|Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he thought out his plans
1|beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected
1|familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him
1|in social standing. Something always drew him toward those richer
1|and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the
1|most opportune moment for making use of people.
1|
1|Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezukhov and a rich man, felt
1|himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset
1|and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He
1|had to sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the
1|purpose of which was not clear to him, to question his chief
1|steward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive many people
1|who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would
1|now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them.
1|These different people--businessmen, relations, and acquaintances
1|alike--were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most
1|friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly
1|convinced of Pierre's noble qualities. He was always hearing such
1|words as: "With your remarkable kindness," or, "With your excellent
1|heart," "You are yourself so honorable Count," or, "Were he as
1|clever as you," and so on, till he began sincerely to believe in his
1|own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so
1|as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he
1|really was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly
1|been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle
1|and affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and
1|hair plastered down like a doll's, had come into Pierre's room after
1|the funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him
1|she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not
1|now feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for
1|permission, after the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks
1|longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much.
1|She could not refrain from weeping at these words. Touched that this
1|statuesque princess could so change, Pierre took her hand and begged
1|her forgiveness, without knowing what for. From that day the eldest
1|princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped
1|scarf for him.
1|
1|"Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with
1|a great deal from the deceased," said Prince Vasili to him, handing
1|him a deed to sign for the princess' benefit.
1|
1|Prince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to
1|throw this bone--a bill for thirty thousand rubles--to the poor
1|princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the
1|affair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after
1|that the princess grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became
1|affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with
1|the mole, who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own
1|confusion when meeting him.
1|
1|It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it
1|would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he
1|could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides,
1|he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or
1|not. He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and
1|cheerful intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some
1|important and general movement; that something was constantly expected
1|of him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many
1|people, but if he did this and that, all would be well; and he did
1|what was demanded of him, but still that happy result always
1|remained in the future.
1|
1|More than anyone else, Prince Vasili took possession of Pierre's
1|affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of
1|Count Bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air
1|of a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would
1|not, for pity's sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was
1|the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth,
1|to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few
1|days he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bezukhov, he would
1|call Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be
1|done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding
1|every time: "You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is
1|purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also
1|know quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible."
1|
1|"Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last," said Prince
1|Vasili one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre's elbow,
1|speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been
1|agreed upon and could not now be altered. "We start tomorrow and I'm
1|giving you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important
1|business here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago.
1|Here is something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for
1|you, and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a
1|Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open
1|before you."
1|
1|Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
1|were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his
1|career, wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasili
1|interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the
1|possibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases
1|when special persuasion was needed.
1|
1|"Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my
1|conscience, and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever
1|complained yet of being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you
1|could throw it up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself
1|when you get to Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from
1|these terrible recollections." Prince Vasili sighed. "Yes, yes, my
1|boy. And my valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly
1|forgetting," he added. "You know, mon cher, your father and I had some
1|accounts to settle, so I have received what was due from the Ryazan
1|estate and will keep it; you won't require it. We'll go into the
1|accounts later."
1|
1|By "what was due from the Ryazan estate" Prince Vasili meant several
1|thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre's peasants, which the
1|prince had retained for himself.
1|
1|In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
1|gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather
1|the rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasili had procured for
1|him, and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so
1|numerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of
1|bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, always
1|in front of him but never attained.
1|
1|Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in
1|Petersburg. The Guards had gone to the front; Dolokhov had been
1|reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the
1|provinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity
1|to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open his
1|mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he
1|respected. His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and
1|was spent chiefly at Prince Vasili's house in the company of the stout
1|princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Helene.
1|
1|Like the others, Anna Pavlovna Scherer showed Pierre the change of
1|attitude toward him that had taken place in society.
1|
1|Formerly in Anna Pavlovna's presence, Pierre had always felt that
1|what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that
1|remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind
1|became foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary
1|Hippolyte's stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now
1|everything Pierre said was charmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did not say
1|so, he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard
1|for his modesty.
1|
1|In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna
1|Pavlovna's usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:
1|"You will find the beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful
1|to see."
1|
1|When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some
1|link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
1|Helene, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation
1|were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased
1|him as an entertaining supposition.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" was like the former one, only the
1|novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a
1|diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the
1|Emperor Alexander's visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august
1|friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold
1|the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna
1|Pavlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently
1|relating to the young man's recent loss by the death of Count Bezukhov
1|(everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was
1|greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and
1|her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the
1|mention of her most august Majesty the Empress Marya Fedorovna. Pierre
1|felt flattered by this. Anna Pavlovna arranged the different groups in
1|her drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which
1|were Prince Vasili and the generals, had the benefit of the
1|diplomat. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join
1|the former, but Anna Pavlovna--who was in the excited condition of a
1|commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant
1|ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action--seeing
1|Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:
1|
1|"Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening." (She
1|glanced at Helene and smiled at her.) "My dear Helene, be charitable
1|to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten
1|minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count
1|who will not refuse to accompany you."
1|
1|The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna detained Pierre,
1|looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.
1|
1|"Isn't she exquisite?" she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately
1|beauty as she glided away. "And how she carries herself! For so
1|young a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It
1|comes from her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least
1|worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society.
1|Don't you think so? I only wanted to know your opinion," and Anna
1|Pavlovna let Pierre go.
1|
1|Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Helene's
1|perfection of manner. If he ever thought of Helene, it was just of her
1|beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in
1|society.
1|
1|The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed
1|desirous of hiding her adoration for Helene and inclined rather to
1|show her fear of Anna Pavlovna. She looked at her niece, as if
1|inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them,
1|Anna Pavlovna again touched Pierre's sleeve, saying: "I hope you won't
1|say that it is dull in my house again," and she glanced at Helene.
1|
1|Helene smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the
1|possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt
1|coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to
1|see Helene, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome
1|and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation,
1|Helene turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she
1|gave to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so
1|little meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt
1|was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to
1|Pierre's father, Count Bezukhov, and showed them her own box. Princess
1|Helene asked to see the portrait of the aunt's husband on the box lid.
1|
1|"That is probably the work of Vinesse," said Pierre, mentioning a
1|celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the
1|snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.
1|
1|He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the
1|snuffbox, passing it across Helene's back. Helene stooped forward to
1|make room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at
1|evening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut
1|very low at front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like
1|marble to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could
1|not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near
1|to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have
1|touched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of
1|perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see
1|her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the
1|charm of her body only covered by her garments. And having once seen
1|this he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an
1|illusion we have once seen through.
1|
1|"So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?" Helene seemed
1|to say. "You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman
1|who may belong to anyone--to you too," said her glance. And at that
1|moment Pierre felt that Helene not only could, but must, be his
1|wife, and that it could not be otherwise.
1|
1|He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing
1|at the altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know,
1|he did not even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he
1|knew not why, that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would
1|happen.
1|
1|Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more
1|to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen
1|her every day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could
1|not, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe
1|grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it
1|for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass.
1|She was terribly close to him. She already had power over him, and
1|between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his
1|own will.
1|
1|"Well, I will leave you in your little corner," came Anna Pavlovna's
1|voice, "I see you are all right there."
1|
1|And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done
1|anything reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him
1|that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.
1|
1|A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna
1|said to him: "I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?"
1|
1|This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and
1|Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg
1|house done up.
1|
1|"That's a good thing, but don't move from Prince Vasili's. It is
1|good to have a friend like the prince," she said, smiling at Prince
1|Vasili. "I know something about that. Don't I? And you are still so
1|young. You need advice. Don't be angry with me for exercising an old
1|woman's privilege."
1|
1|She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they
1|have mentioned their age. "If you marry it will be a different thing,"
1|she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at
1|Helene nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He
1|muttered something and colored.
1|
1|When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking
1|of what had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely
1|understood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her
1|beauty was mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: "Yes, she's good
1|looking," he had understood that this woman might belong to him.
1|
1|"But she's stupid. I have myself said she is stupid," he thought.
1|"There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites
1|in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with
1|her and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that's
1|why he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasili is her
1|father... It's bad...." he reflected, but while he was thinking this
1|(the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and
1|was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while
1|thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be
1|his wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all
1|he had thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her
1|not as the daughter of Prince Vasili, but visualized her whole body
1|only veiled by its gray dress. "But no! Why did this thought never
1|occur to me before?" and again he told himself that it was impossible,
1|that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him
1|dishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks
1|and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He
1|recalled Anna Pavlovna's words and looks when she spoke to him about
1|his house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasili and
1|others, and was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way,
1|bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he
1|ought not to do. But at the very time he was expressing this
1|conviction to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in
1|all its womanly beauty.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|In November, 1805, Prince Vasili had to go on a tour of inspection
1|in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to
1|visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son
1|Anatole where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince
1|Nicholas Bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the
1|daughter of that rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking
1|these new affairs, Prince Vasili had to settle matters with Pierre,
1|who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in
1|Prince Vasili's house where he was staying, and had been absurd,
1|excited, and foolish in Helene's presence (as a lover should be),
1|but had not yet proposed to her.
1|
1|"This is all very fine, but things must be settled," said Prince
1|Vasili to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that
1|Pierre who was under such obligations to him ("But never mind that")
1|was not behaving very well in this matter. "Youth, frivolity... well,
1|God be with him," thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,
1|"but it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be
1|Lelya's name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does
1|not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair--yes, my
1|affair. I am her father."
1|
1|Six weeks after Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" and after the sleepless
1|night when he had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and
1|that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision,
1|had not left Prince Vasili's and felt with terror that in people's
1|eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was
1|impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that
1|he could not break away from her, and that though it would be a
1|terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might
1|perhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vasili (who had
1|rarely before given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without
1|having an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he
1|wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone's
1|expectation. Prince Vasili, in the rare moments when he was at home,
1|would take Pierre's hand in passing and draw it downwards, or
1|absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre
1|to kiss and would say: "Till tomorrow," or, "Be in to dinner or I
1|shall not see you," or, "I am staying in for your sake," and so on.
1|And though Prince Vasili, when he stayed in (as he said) for
1|Pierre's sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre
1|felt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to himself one and
1|the same thing: "It is time I understood her and made up my mind
1|what she really is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No,
1|she is not stupid, she is an excellent girl," he sometimes said to
1|himself "she never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She
1|says little, but what she does say is always clear and simple, so
1|she is not stupid. She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so
1|she cannot be a bad woman!" He had often begun to make reflections
1|or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him
1|either by a brief but appropriate remark--showing that it did not
1|interest her--or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than
1|anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in
1|regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.
1|
1|She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant
1|for him alone, in which there was something more significant than in
1|the general smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that
1|everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line,
1|and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it, but an
1|incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful
1|step. A thousand times during that month and a half while he felt
1|himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to
1|himself: "What am I doing? I need resolution. Can it be that I have
1|none?"
1|
1|He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this
1|matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself
1|and really possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when
1|they feel themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was
1|overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at
1|Anna Pavlovna's, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire
1|paralyzed his will.
1|
1|On Helene's name day, a small party of just their own people--as his
1|wife said--met for supper at Prince Vasili's. All these friends and
1|relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl
1|would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.
1|Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,
1|was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the
1|more important guests--an old general and his wife, and Anna
1|Pavlovna Scherer. At the other end sat the younger and less
1|important guests, and there too sat the members of the family, and
1|Pierre and Helene, side by side. Prince Vasili was not having any
1|supper: he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by
1|one, now by another, of the guests. To each of them he made some
1|careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Helene, whose
1|presence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The
1|wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did
1|the ladies' toilets and the gold and silver of the men's epaulets;
1|servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the clatter of
1|plates, knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several
1|conversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was
1|heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at
1|which she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the
1|misfortunes of some Mary Viktorovna or other. At the center of the
1|table, Prince Vasili attracted everybody's attention. With a facetious
1|smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday's
1|meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich
1|Vyazmitinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had
1|received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander
1|from the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said that he was
1|receiving from all sides declarations of the people's loyalty, that
1|the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that
1|he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor
1|to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: "Sergey
1|Kuzmich, From all sides reports reach me," etc.
1|
1|"Well, and so he never got farther than: 'Sergey Kuzmich'?" asked
1|one of the ladies.
1|
1|"Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther," answered Prince Vasili,
1|laughing, "'Sergey Kuzmich... From all sides... From all sides...
1|Sergey Kuzmich...' Poor Vyazmitinov could not get any farther! He
1|began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered 'Sergey'
1|he sobbed, 'Kuz-mi-ch,' tears, and 'From all sides' was smothered in
1|sobs and he could get no farther. And again his handkerchief, and
1|again: 'Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides,'... and tears, till at last
1|somebody else was asked to read it."
1|
1|"Kuzmich... From all sides... and then tears," someone repeated
1|laughing.
1|
1|"Don't be unkind," cried Anna Pavlovna from her end of the table
1|holding up a threatening finger. "He is such a worthy and excellent
1|man, our dear Vyazmitinov...."
1|
1|Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where
1|the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and
1|under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre
1|and Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the
1|table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that
1|had nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmich--a smile of bashfulness at their
1|own feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked,
1|much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and however
1|they avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant
1|as they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances
1|they gave that the story about Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the
1|food were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company
1|was directed to--Pierre and Helene. Prince Vasili mimicked the sobbing
1|of Sergey Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his
1|daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly
1|said: "Yes... it's getting on, it will all be settled today." Anna
1|Pavlovna threatened him on behalf of "our dear Vyazmitinov," and in
1|her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasili read
1|a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter's
1|happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to
1|the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and
1|her sigh seemed to say: "Yes, there's nothing left for you and me
1|but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these
1|young ones to be thus boldly, provocatively happy." "And what nonsense
1|all this is that I am saying!" thought a diplomatist, glancing at
1|the happy faces of the lovers. "That's happiness!"
1|
1|Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting
1|that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a
1|healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this
1|human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their
1|affected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the
1|animation was evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the
1|footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their
1|duties as they looked at the beautiful Helene with her radiant face
1|and at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It
1|seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two
1|happy faces alone.
1|
1|Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased
1|and embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some
1|occupation. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only
1|now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of
1|reality shot unexpectedly through his mind.
1|
1|"So it is all finished!" he thought. "And how has it all happened?
1|How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself
1|alone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They
1|are all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I
1|cannot, I cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not
1|know, but it will certainly happen!" thought Pierre, glancing at those
1|dazzling shoulders close to his eyes.
1|
1|Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it
1|awkward to attract everyone's attention and to be considered a lucky
1|man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris
1|possessed of a Helen. "But no doubt it always is and must be so!" he
1|consoled himself. "And besides, what have I done to bring it about?
1|How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasili. Then
1|there was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I
1|played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with
1|her. How did it begin, when did it all come about?" And here he was
1|sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her
1|nearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would
1|suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually
1|beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and
1|flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest,
1|raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a
1|familiar voice repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre
1|was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said.
1|
1|"I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski," repeated
1|Prince Vasili a third time. "How absent-minded you are, my dear
1|fellow."
1|
1|Prince Vasili smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling
1|at him and Helene. "Well, what of it, if you all know it?" thought
1|Pierre. "What of it? It's the truth!" and he himself smiled his gentle
1|childlike smile, and Helene smiled too.
1|
1|"When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?" repeated Prince
1|Vasili, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a
1|dispute.
1|
1|"How can one talk or think of such trifles?" thought Pierre.
1|
1|"Yes, from Olmutz," he answered, with a sigh.
1|
1|After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the
1|drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking
1|leave of Helene. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an
1|important occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go
1|away, refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a
1|mournful silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity
1|of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre's happiness. The
1|old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was.
1|"Oh, the old fool," he thought. "That Princess Helene will be
1|beautiful still when she's fifty."
1|
1|"I think I may congratulate you," whispered Anna Pavlovna to the old
1|princess, kissing her soundly. "If I hadn't this headache I'd have
1|stayed longer."
1|
1|The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her
1|daughter's happiness.
1|
1|While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a
1|long time alone with Helene in the little drawing room where they were
1|sitting. He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained
1|alone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt
1|that it was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take
1|the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone
1|else's place here beside Helene. "This happiness is not for you," some
1|inner voice whispered to him. "This happiness is for those who have
1|not in them what there is in you."
1|
1|But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether
1|she was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple
1|manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest
1|she had ever had.
1|
1|Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in
1|the large drawing room. Prince Vasili came up to Pierre with languid
1|footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasili
1|gave him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just
1|said was so strange that one could not take it in. But then the
1|expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre's hand downwards,
1|made him sit down, and smiled affectionately.
1|
1|"Well, Lelya?" he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and
1|addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural
1|to parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which
1|Prince Vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents.
1|
1|And he again turned to Pierre.
1|
1|"Sergey Kuzmich--From all sides-" he said, unbuttoning the top
1|button of his waistcoat.
1|
1|Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the
1|story about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just then,
1|and Prince Vasili saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered
1|something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince
1|was disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the
1|world touched Pierre: he looked at Helene and she too seemed
1|disconcerted, and her look seemed to say: "Well, it is your own
1|fault."
1|
1|"The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!" thought Pierre, and
1|he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergey
1|Kuzmich, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it
1|properly. Helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it.
1|
1|When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the princess, his
1|wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.
1|
1|"Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear..."
1|
1|"Marriages are made in heaven," replied the elderly lady.
1|
1|Prince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat
1|down on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and
1|seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.
1|
1|"Aline," he said to his wife, "go and see what they are about."
1|
1|The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified
1|and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room.
1|Pierre and Helene still sat talking just as before.
1|
1|"Still the same," she said to her husband.
1|
1|Prince Vasili frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and
1|his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him.
1|Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps
1|went past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he
1|went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant
1|that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it.
1|
1|"Thank God!" said Prince Vasili. "My wife has told me everything!"
1|(He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)--"My
1|dear boy... Lelya... I am very pleased." (His voice trembled.) "I
1|loved your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless
1|you!..."
1|
1|He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with
1|his malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.
1|
1|"Princess, come here!" he shouted.
1|
1|The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using
1|her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful
1|Helene's hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.
1|
1|"All this had to be and could not be otherwise," thought Pierre, "so
1|it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because
1|it's definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt." Pierre held
1|the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom
1|as it rose and fell.
1|
1|"Helene!" he said aloud and paused.
1|
1|"Something special is always said in such cases," he thought, but
1|could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face.
1|She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.
1|
1|"Oh, take those off... those..." she said, pointing to his
1|spectacles.
1|
1|Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes
1|have from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a
1|frightened and inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and
1|kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she
1|intercepted his lips and met them with her own. Her face struck
1|Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.
1|
1|"It is too late now, it's done; besides I love her," thought Pierre.
1|
1|"Je vous aime!"* he said, remembering what has to be said at such
1|moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of
1|himself.
1|
1|
1|*"I love you."
1|
1|
1|Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezukhov's
1|large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as
1|people said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions
1|of money.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince Vasili
1|in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying
1|him a visit. "I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of
1|course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see
1|you at the same time, my honored benefactor," wrote Prince Vasili. "My
1|son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you
1|will allow him personally to express the deep respect that,
1|emulating his father, he feels for you."
1|
1|"It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors
1|are coming to us of their own accord," incautiously remarked the
1|little princess on hearing the news.
1|
1|Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.
1|
1|A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili's servants came one
1|evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.
1|
1|Old Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasili's
1|character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and
1|Alexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors. And
1|now, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little
1|princess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion
1|changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever
1|he mentioned him. On the day of Prince Vasili's arrival, Prince
1|Bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether
1|he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was coming, or whether
1|his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince
1|Vasili's visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon
1|had already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his
1|report.
1|
1|"Do you hear how he's walking?" said Tikhon, drawing the architect's
1|attention to the sound of the prince's footsteps. "Stepping flat on
1|his heels--we know what that means...."
1|
1|However, at nine o'clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable
1|collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day
1|before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the
1|habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still
1|visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of
1|the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince
1|went through the conservatories, the serfs' quarters, and the
1|outbuildings, frowning and silent.
1|
1|"Can a sleigh pass?" he asked his overseer, a venerable man,
1|resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him
1|back to the house.
1|
1|"The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor."
1|
1|The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. "God be
1|thanked," thought the overseer, "the storm has blown over!"
1|
1|"It would have been hard to drive up, your honor," he added. "I
1|heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor."
1|
1|The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,
1|frowning.
1|
1|"What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?" he said in his
1|shrill, harsh voice. "The road is not swept for the princess my
1|daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!"
1|
1|"Your honor, I thought..."
1|
1|"You thought!" shouted the prince, his words coming more and more
1|rapidly and indistinctly. "You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...
1|I'll teach you to think!" and lifting his stick he swung it and
1|would have hit Alpatych, the overseer, had not the latter
1|instinctively avoided the blow. "Thought... Blackguards..." shouted
1|the prince rapidly.
1|
1|But although Alpatych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding
1|the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly
1|before him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he
1|continued to shout: "Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!"
1|did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house.
1|
1|Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew
1|that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne with a radiant face that said: "I know nothing, I am the
1|same as usual," and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with
1|downcast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such
1|occasions she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could
1|not. She thought: "If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not
1|sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he
1|will say (as he has done before) that I'm in the dumps."
1|
1|The prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted.
1|
1|"Fool... or dummy!" he muttered.
1|
1|"And the other one is not here. They've been telling tales," he
1|thought--referring to the little princess who was not in the dining
1|room.
1|
1|"Where is the princess?" he asked. "Hiding?"
1|
1|"She is not very well," answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a
1|bright smile, "so she won't come down. It is natural in her state."
1|
1|"Hm! Hm!" muttered the prince, sitting down.
1|
1|His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
1|flung it away. Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little
1|princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the
1|prince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to
1|appear.
1|
1|"I am afraid for the baby," she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:
1|"Heaven knows what a fright might do."
1|
1|In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear,
1|and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
1|realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The
1|prince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his
1|contempt for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to
1|life at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her
1|room, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized
1|him.
1|
1|"So we are to have visitors, mon prince?" remarked Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. "His
1|Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son, I understand?" she
1|said inquiringly.
1|
1|"Hm!--his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the
1|service," said the prince disdainfully. "Why his son is coming I don't
1|understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don't
1|want him." (He looked at his blushing daughter.) "Are you unwell
1|today? Eh? Afraid of the 'minister' as that idiot Alpatych called
1|him this morning?"
1|
1|"No, mon pere."
1|
1|Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice
1|of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the
1|conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and
1|after the soup the prince became more genial.
1|
1|After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little
1|princess was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, her
1|maid. She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law.
1|
1|She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her
1|cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.
1|
1|"Yes, I feel a kind of oppression," she said in reply to the
1|prince's question as to how she felt.
1|
1|"Do you want anything?"
1|
1|"No, merci, mon pere."
1|
1|"Well, all right, all right."
1|
1|He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood
1|with bowed head.
1|
1|"Has the snow been shoveled back?"
1|
1|"Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven's sake... It was only
1|my stupidity."
1|
1|"All right, all right," interrupted the prince, and laughing his
1|unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss, and
1|then proceeded to his study.
1|
1|Prince Vasili arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by
1|coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to
1|one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.
1|
1|Prince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.
1|
1|Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo
1|before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly
1|fixed his large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a
1|continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to
1|provide for him. And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and
1|a rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought,
1|turn out very well and amusingly. "And why not marry her if she really
1|has so much money? That never does any harm," thought Anatole.
1|
1|He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
1|become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his
1|father's room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him.
1|Prince Vasili's two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round
1|with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
1|entered, as if to say: "Yes, that's how I want you to look."
1|
1|"I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?" Anatole asked,
1|as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been
1|mentioned during the journey.
1|
1|"Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious
1|with the old prince."
1|
1|"If he starts a row I'll go away," said Prince Anatole. "I can't
1|bear those old men! Eh?"
1|
1|"Remember, for you everything depends on this."
1|
1|In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants' rooms
1|that the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of
1|both had been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in
1|her room, vainly trying to master her agitation.
1|
1|"Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never
1|happen!" she said, looking at herself in the glass. "How shall I enter
1|the drawing room? Even if I like him I can't now be myself with
1|him." The mere thought of her father's look filled her with terror.
1|The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received
1|from Masha, the lady's maid, the necessary report of how handsome
1|the minister's son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and
1|with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while
1|the son had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time.
1|Having received this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from the
1|corridor, went into Princess Mary's room.
1|
1|"You know they've come, Marie?" said the little princess, waddling
1|in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.
1|
1|She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the
1|morning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully
1|done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its
1|sunken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg
1|society, it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become.
1|Some unobtrusive touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne's
1|toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.
1|
1|"What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?" she
1|began. "They'll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing
1|room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself
1|up at all!"
1|
1|The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and
1|merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary
1|should be dressed. Princess Mary's self-esteem was wounded by the fact
1|that the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both
1|her companions' not having the least conception that it could be
1|otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them
1|would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to
1|dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed,
1|her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it
1|took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as
1|she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these
1|women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so
1|plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they
1|began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the naive and firm
1|conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty.
1|
1|"No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty," said Lise, looking
1|sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. "You have a maroon
1|dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life
1|may be at stake. But this one is too light, it's not becoming!"
1|
1|It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary
1|that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little
1|princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were
1|placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged
1|lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They
1|forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered,
1|and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that
1|face, it would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three
1|changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair
1|had been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered
1|and spoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a
1|pale-blue scarf, the little princess walked twice round her, now
1|adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now arranging
1|the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side
1|and then on the other.
1|
1|"No, it will not do," she said decidedly, clasping her hands. "No,
1|Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little
1|gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie," she said
1|to the maid, "bring the princess her gray dress, and you'll see,
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it," she added, smiling
1|with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.
1|
1|But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained
1|sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in
1|the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to
1|burst into sobs.
1|
1|"Come, dear princess," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, "just one more
1|little effort."
1|
1|The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to
1|Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Well, now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming," she
1|said.
1|
1|The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne's, and Katie's, who
1|was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping
1|of birds.
1|
1|"No, leave me alone," said Princess Mary.
1|
1|Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the
1|birds was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large,
1|thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and
1|imploringly at them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel
1|to insist.
1|
1|"At least, change your coiffure," said the little princess.
1|"Didn't I tell you," she went on, turning reproachfully to
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, "Mary's is a face which such a coiffure does
1|not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it."
1|
1|"Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same
1|to me," answered a voice struggling with tears.
1|
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to
1|themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse
1|than usual, but it was too late. She was looking at them with an
1|expression they both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This
1|expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she never
1|inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her
1|face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.
1|
1|"You will change it, won't you?" said Lise. And as Princess Mary
1|gave no answer, she left the room.
1|
1|Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise's
1|request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look
1|in her glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with
1|downcast eyes and pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and
1|strangely attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried her
1|into a totally different happy world of his own. She fancied a
1|child, her own--such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her
1|nurse's daughter--at her own breast, the husband standing by and
1|gazing tenderly at her and the child. "But no, it is impossible, I
1|am too ugly," she thought.
1|
1|"Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment," came the
1|maid's voice at the door.
1|
1|She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking,
1|and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and,
1|her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit
1|by a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments.
1|A painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly
1|love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess
1|Mary dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most
1|deeply hidden longing was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide
1|this feeling from others and even from herself, the stronger it
1|grew. "O God," she said, "how am I to stifle in my heart these
1|temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile
1|fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?" And scarcely had she
1|put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart.
1|"Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or
1|envious. Man's future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee,
1|but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God's
1|will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill
1|His will." With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the
1|fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed,
1|and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and
1|coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. What
1|could all that matter in comparison with the will of God, without
1|Whose care not a hair of man's head can fall?
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasili and his son were already
1|in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her
1|heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little
1|princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: "Voila Marie!"
1|Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince
1|Vasili's face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but
1|immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting
1|the impression "Marie" produced on the visitors. And she saw
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her
1|unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not
1|see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving
1|toward her as she entered the room. Prince Vasili approached first,
1|and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered
1|his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite
1|well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She
1|only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her
1|lips a white forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair
1|smelling of pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck by his
1|beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his
1|uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging
1|one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face
1|at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her
1|at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in
1|conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of
1|composure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man lacking in
1|self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a
1|consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to
1|find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung
1|his foot, and smilingly examined the princess' hair. It was evident
1|that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. "If anyone
1|finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don't want to,"
1|he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a
1|manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even
1|love--a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as
1|if he said to them: "I know you, I know you, but why should I bother
1|about you? You'd be only too glad, of course." Perhaps he did not
1|really think this when he met women--even probably he did not, for in
1|general he thought very little--but his looks and manner gave that
1|impression. The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that
1|she did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his
1|father. The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess
1|Lise's voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth.
1|She met Prince Vasili with that playful manner often employed by
1|lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between
1|the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private,
1|long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such
1|reminiscences really exist--just as none existed in this case. Prince
1|Vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew
1|Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of
1|things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared
1|them and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in
1|these merry reminiscences.
1|
1|"Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
1|ourselves, dear prince," said the little princess (of course, in
1|French) to Prince Vasili. "It's not as at Annette's* receptions
1|where you always ran away; you remember cette chere Annette!"
1|
1|
1|*Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|
1|"Ah, but you won't talk politics to me like Annette!"
1|
1|"And our little tea table?"
1|
1|"Oh, yes!"
1|
1|"Why is it you were never at Annette's?" the little princess asked
1|Anatole. "Ah, I know, I know," she said with a sly glance, "your
1|brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!" and she shook her
1|finger at him, "I have even heard of your doings in Paris!"
1|
1|"And didn't Hippolyte tell you?" asked Prince Vasili, turning to his
1|son and seizing the little princess' arm as if she would have run away
1|and he had just managed to catch her, "didn't he tell you how he
1|himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the
1|door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess," he added, turning
1|to Princess Mary.
1|
1|When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized
1|the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.
1|
1|She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since
1|Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole
1|answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a
1|smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty
1|little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not
1|find Bald Hills dull either. "Not at all bad!" he thought, examining
1|her, "not at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her
1|along with her when we're married, la petite est gentille."*
1|
1|
1|*The little one is charming.
1|
1|
1|The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and
1|considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed
1|him. "What are Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince
1|Vasili is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine
1|specimen," he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the
1|coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question
1|he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself.
1|The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from
1|his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly
1|asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have
1|to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings
1|but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary,
1|little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. "And why
1|should she marry?" he thought. "To be unhappy for certain. There's
1|Lise, married to Andrew--a better husband one would think could hardly
1|be found nowadays--but is she contented with her lot? And who would
1|marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They'll take her for her
1|connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and
1|even the happier for it?" So thought Prince Bolkonski while
1|dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an
1|immediate answer. Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident
1|intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask
1|for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad.
1|"Well, I've nothing against it," the prince said to himself, "but he
1|must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see."
1|
1|"That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!" he added
1|aloud.
1|
1|He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing
1|rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little
1|princess' dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, Princess Mary's
1|unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles,
1|and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. "Got
1|herself up like a fool!" he thought, looking irritably at her. "She is
1|shameless, and he ignores her!"
1|
1|He went straight up to Prince Vasili.
1|
1|"Well! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? Glad to see you!"
1|
1|"Friendship laughs at distance," began Prince Vasili in his usual
1|rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. "Here is my second son; please
1|love and befriend him."
1|
1|Prince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole.
1|
1|"Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!" he said. "Well, come and
1|kiss me," and he offered his cheek.
1|
1|Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and
1|perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his
1|father had told him to expect.
1|
1|Prince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the
1|sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasili, pointed to it
1|and began questioning him about political affairs and news. He
1|seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasili said, but kept
1|glancing at Princess Mary.
1|
1|"And so they are writing from Potsdam already?" he said, repeating
1|Prince Vasili's last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his
1|daughter.
1|
1|"Is it for visitors you've got yourself up like that, eh?" said
1|he. "Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for
1|the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you
1|are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent."
1|
1|"It was my fault, mon pere," interceded the little princess, with
1|a blush.
1|
1|"You must do as you please," said Prince Bolkonski, bowing to his
1|daughter-in-law, "but she need not make a fool of herself, she's plain
1|enough as it is."
1|
1|And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who
1|was reduced to tears.
1|
1|"On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,"
1|said Prince Vasili.
1|
1|"Now you, young prince, what's your name?" said Prince Bolkonski,
1|turning to Anatole, "come here, let us talk and get acquainted."
1|
1|"Now the fun begins," thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile
1|beside the old prince.
1|
1|"Well, my dear boy, I hear you've been educated abroad, not taught
1|to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,
1|my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?" asked the old
1|man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.
1|
1|"No, I have been transferred to the line," said Anatole, hardly able
1|to restrain his laughter.
1|
1|"Ah! That's a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the
1|Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve.
1|Well, are you off to the front?"
1|
1|"No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am
1|attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?" said Anatole,
1|turning to his father with a laugh.
1|
1|"A splendid soldier, splendid! 'What am I attached to!' Ha, ha, ha!"
1|laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly
1|Prince Bolkonski frowned.
1|
1|"You may go," he said to Anatole.
1|
1|Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.
1|
1|"And so you've had him educated abroad, Prince Vasili, haven't you?"
1|said the old prince to Prince Vasili.
1|
1|"I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education
1|there is much better than ours."
1|
1|"Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The
1|lad's a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now." He took
1|Prince Vasili's arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were
1|alone together, Prince Vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the
1|old prince.
1|
1|"Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can't part from
1|her?" said the old prince angrily. "What an idea! I'm ready for it
1|tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better.
1|You know my principles--everything aboveboard? I will ask her tomorrow
1|in your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can
1|stay and I'll see." The old prince snorted. "Let her marry, it's all
1|the same to me!" he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting
1|from his son.
1|
1|"I will tell you frankly," said Prince Vasili in the tone of a
1|crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so
1|keen-sighted companion. "You know, you see right through people.
1|Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an
1|excellent son or kinsman."
1|
1|"All right, all right, we'll see!"
1|
1|As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of
1|time without male society, on Anatole's appearance all the three women
1|of Prince Bolkonski's household felt that their life had not been real
1|till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing
1|immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have
1|been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full
1|of significance.
1|
1|Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The
1|handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband
1|absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave,
1|determined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that.
1|Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her
1|imagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal them.
1|
1|"But am I not too cold with him?" thought the princess. "I try to be
1|reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him
1|already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine
1|that I do not like him."
1|
1|And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to
1|her new guest. "Poor girl, she's devilish ugly!" thought Anatole.
1|
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole's
1|arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young
1|woman without any definite position, without relations or even a
1|country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince
1|Bolkonski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess
1|Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian
1|prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the
1|plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in
1|love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian
1|prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but
1|finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It
1|was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor
1|mother (sa pauvre mere) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a
1|man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to
1|tears as in imagination she told this story to him, her seducer. And
1|now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away
1|and then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her. So her
1|future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne's head at the very time
1|she was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that
1|guided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should
1|do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that
1|Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she
1|wished and tried to please him as much as possible.
1|
1|The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,
1|unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the
1|familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any
1|struggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.
1|
1|Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man
1|tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the
1|spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was
1|beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him
1|with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless
1|actions.
1|
1|After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess
1|Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in
1|high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully
1|joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately
1|poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more
1|poetic. But Anatole's expression, though his eyes were fixed on her,
1|referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne's
1|little foot, which he was then touching with his own under the
1|clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess
1|Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and
1|hope that was also new to the princess.
1|
1|"How she loves me!" thought Princess Mary. "How happy I am now,
1|and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband?
1|Can it be possible?" she thought, not daring to look at his face,
1|but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.
1|
1|In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole
1|kissed Princess Mary's hand. She did not know how she found the
1|courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came
1|near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up
1|and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand. (This was not etiquette, but
1|then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!)
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened
1|look.
1|
1|"What delicacy!" thought the princess. "Is it possible that Amelie"
1|(Mademoiselle Bourienne) "thinks I could be jealous of her, and not
1|value her pure affection and devotion to me?" She went up to her and
1|kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess' hand.
1|
1|"No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are
1|behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!" she
1|said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as
1|he got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.
1|
1|"Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind--yes,
1|kind, that is the chief thing," thought Princess Mary; and fear, which
1|she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round,
1|it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen
1|in the dark corner. And this someone was he--the devil--and he was
1|also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.
1|
1|She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.
1|
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a
1|long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at
1|someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of
1|her pauvre mere rebuking her for her fall.
1|
1|The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly
1|made. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every
1|position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her
1|now more than ever because Anatole's presence had vividly recalled
1|to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was
1|light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and
1|nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy
1|feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.
1|
1|"I told you it was all lumps and holes!" the little princess
1|repeated. "I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it's not my
1|fault!" and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.
1|
1|The old prince did not sleep either. Tikhon, half asleep, heard
1|him pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though
1|he had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more
1|pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter,
1|whom he loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would
1|consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he
1|should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.
1|
1|"The first man that turns up--she forgets her father and
1|everything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her
1|tail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she
1|knew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And don't I see that that
1|idiot had eyes only for Bourienne--I shall have to get rid of her. And
1|how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride
1|for herself she might at least have some for my sake! She must be
1|shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at
1|Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but I'll let her see...."
1|
1|The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
1|mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,
1|Princess Mary's self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to
1|be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this
1|thought, he called Tikhon and began to undress.
1|
1|"What devil brought them here?" thought he, while Tikhon was putting
1|the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. "I
1|never invited them. They came to disturb my life--and there is not
1|much of it left."
1|
1|"Devil take 'em!" he muttered, while his head was still covered by
1|the shirt.
1|
1|Tikhon knew his master's habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and
1|therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive
1|expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.
1|
1|"Gone to bed?" asked the prince.
1|
1|Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of
1|his master's thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince
1|Vasili and his son.
1|
1|"They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency."
1|
1|"No good... no good..." said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his
1|feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing
1|gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.
1|
1|Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of
1|their romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre mere; they
1|understood that they had much to say to one another in private and
1|so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one
1|another alone. When Princess Mary went to her father's room at the
1|usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the
1|conservatory.
1|
1|Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special
1|trepidation. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that
1|her fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she
1|thought about it. She read this in Tikhon's face and in that of Prince
1|Vasili's valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the
1|corridor carrying hot water.
1|
1|The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of
1|his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking
1|expression of her father's. His face wore that expression when his dry
1|hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
1|arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,
1|repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.
1|
1|He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.
1|
1|"I have had a proposition made me concerning you," he said with an
1|unnatural smile. "I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not
1|come and brought his pupil with him" (for some reason Prince Bolkonski
1|referred to Anatole as a "pupil") "for the sake of my beautiful
1|eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you
1|know my principles, I refer it to you."
1|
1|"How am I to understand you, mon pere?" said the princess, growing
1|pale and then blushing.
1|
1|"How understand me!" cried her father angrily. "Prince Vasili
1|finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to
1|you on his pupil's behalf. That's how it's to be understood! 'How
1|understand it'!... And I ask you!"
1|
1|"I do not know what you think, Father," whispered the princess.
1|
1|"I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I'm not going to
1|get married. What about you? That's what I want to know."
1|
1|The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with
1|disapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her
1|fate would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not
1|to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but
1|would only be able to submit from habit, and she said: "I wish only to
1|do your will, but if I had to express my own desire..." She had no
1|time to finish. The old prince interrupted her.
1|
1|"That's admirable!" he shouted. "He will take you with your dowry
1|and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She'll be the
1|wife, while you..."
1|
1|The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on
1|his daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.
1|
1|"Now then, now then, I'm only joking!" he said. "Remember this,
1|Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
1|choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life's happiness
1|depends on your decision. Never mind me!"
1|
1|"But I do not know, Father!"
1|
1|"There's no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry
1|you or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room,
1|think it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence:
1|yes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but
1|you had better think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!" he
1|still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already
1|staggered out of the study.
1|
1|Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had
1|said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be
1|sure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of
1|it. She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing
1|nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps
1|away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to
1|her. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole
1|looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the
1|waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.
1|
1|"Who's that? Why? Wait a moment!" Anatole's face seemed to say.
1|Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand
1|it. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole
1|bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in
1|a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders
1|went to the door that led to his own apartments.
1|
1|An hour later, Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old
1|prince; he added that Prince Vasili was also there. When Tikhon came
1|to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding
1|the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her
1|hair. The princess' beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance
1|were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne's pretty face.
1|
1|"No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!" said
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne.
1|
1|"Why? I love you more than ever," said Princess Mary, "and I will
1|try to do all I can for your happiness."
1|
1|"But you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand
1|being so carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother..."
1|
1|"I quite understand," answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.
1|"Calm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father," she said, and went
1|out.
1|
1|Prince Vasili, with one leg thrown high over the other and a
1|snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion
1|on his face, as if stirred to his heart's core and himself
1|regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary
1|entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear, my dear!" he began, rising and taking her by both
1|hands. Then, sighing, he added: "My son's fate is in your hands.
1|Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a
1|daughter!"
1|
1|He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.
1|
1|"Fr... fr..." snorted Prince Bolkonski. "The prince is making a
1|proposition to you in his pupil's--I mean, his son's--name. Do you
1|wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin's wife? Reply: yes or no," he
1|shouted, "and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also.
1|Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion," added Prince Bolkonski, turning
1|to Prince Vasili and answering his imploring look. "Yes, or no?"
1|
1|"My desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my
1|life from yours. I don't wish to marry," she answered positively,
1|glancing at Prince Vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes.
1|
1|"Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!" cried Prince
1|Bolkonski, frowning and taking his daughter's hand; he did not kiss
1|her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and
1|pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.
1|
1|Prince Vasili rose.
1|
1|"My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never
1|forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching
1|this heart, so kind and generous? Say 'perhaps'... The future is so
1|long. Say 'perhaps.'"
1|
1|"Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you
1|for the honor, but I shall never be your son's wife."
1|
1|"Well, so that's finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have
1|seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!" said the
1|old prince. "Very, very glad to have seen you," repeated he,
1|embracing Prince Vasili.
1|
1|"My vocation is a different one," thought Princess Mary. "My
1|vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the
1|happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will
1|arrange poor Amelie's happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so
1|passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between
1|them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my
1|father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so
1|unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how
1|passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself!
1|Perhaps I might have done the same!..." thought Princess Mary.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|It was long since the Rostovs had news of Nicholas. Not till
1|midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's
1|handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm
1|and haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read
1|the letter.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the
1|house, on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the
1|room and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing
1|at the same time.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still
1|living with the Rostovs.
1|
1|"My dear friend?" said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry,
1|prepared to sympathize in any way.
1|
1|The count sobbed yet more.
1|
1|"Nikolenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling
1|boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How
1|tell the little countess!"
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief
1|wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried
1|her own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and
1|till teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God's
1|help, would inform her.
1|
1|At dinner Anna Mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war
1|news and about Nikolenka, twice asked when the last letter had been
1|received from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that
1|they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each
1|time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she
1|glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikhaylovna, the latter very
1|adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters. Natasha,
1|who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to
1|feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her
1|ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was
1|some secret between her father and Anna Mikhaylovna, that it had
1|something to do with her brother, and that Anna Mikhaylovna was
1|preparing them for it. Bold as she was, Natasha, who knew how
1|sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka, did not
1|venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat
1|anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her
1|governess' remarks. After dinner, she rushed head long after Anna
1|Mikhaylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon
1|as she overtook her in the sitting room.
1|
1|"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!"
1|
1|"Nothing, my dear."
1|
1|"No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won't give up--I know you know
1|something."
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna shook her head.
1|
1|"You are a little slyboots," she said.
1|
1|"A letter from Nikolenka! I'm sure of it!" exclaimed Natasha,
1|reading confirmation in Anna Mikhaylovna's face.
1|
1|"But for God's sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your
1|mamma."
1|
1|"I will, I will, only tell me! You won't? Then I will go and tell at
1|once."
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the
1|letter, on condition that she should tell no one.
1|
1|"No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself,
1|"I won't tell anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.
1|
1|"Nikolenka... wounded... a letter," she announced in gleeful
1|triumph.
1|
1|"Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly turning white.
1|
1|Natasha, seeing the impression the news of her brother's wound
1|produced on Sonya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the
1|news.
1|
1|She rushed to Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry.
1|
1|"A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he
1|wrote himself," said she through her tears.
1|
1|"There now! It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked
1|Petya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. "Now I'm very
1|glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself
1|so. You are all blubberers and understand nothing."
1|
1|Natasha smiled through her tears.
1|
1|"You haven't read the letter?" asked Sonya.
1|
1|"No, but she said that it was all over and that he's now an
1|officer."
1|
1|"Thank God!" said Sonya, crossing herself. "But perhaps she deceived
1|you. Let us go to Mamma."
1|
1|Petya paced the room in silence for a time.
1|
1|"If I'd been in Nikolenka's place I would have killed even more of
1|those Frenchmen," he said. "What nasty brutes they are! I'd have
1|killed so many that there'd have been a heap of them."
1|
1|"Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"
1|
1|"I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles," said Petya.
1|
1|"Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment's
1|silence.
1|
1|Sonya smiled.
1|
1|"Do I remember Nicholas?"
1|
1|"No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him
1|perfectly, remember everything?" said Natasha, with an expressive
1|gesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very definite
1|meaning. "I remember Nikolenka too, I remember him well," she said.
1|"But I don't remember Boris. I don't remember him a bit."
1|
1|"What! You don't remember Boris?" asked Sonya in surprise.
1|
1|"It's not that I don't remember--I know what he is like, but not
1|as I remember Nikolenka. Him--I just shut my eyes and remember, but
1|Boris... No!" (She shut her eyes.)"No! there's nothing at all."
1|
1|"Oh, Natasha!" said Sonya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her
1|friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to
1|say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was
1|out of the question, "I am in love with your brother once for all and,
1|whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him
1|as long as I live."
1|
1|Natasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and
1|said nothing. She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there
1|was such love as Sonya was speaking of. But Natasha had not yet felt
1|anything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
1|
1|"Shall you write to him?" she asked.
1|
1|Sonya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas,
1|and whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already
1|an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of
1|herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had
1|taken on himself?
1|
1|"I don't know. I think if he writes, I will write too," she said,
1|blushing.
1|
1|"And you won't feel ashamed to write to him?"
1|
1|Sonya smiled.
1|
1|"No."
1|
1|"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris. I'm not going to."
1|
1|"Why should you be ashamed?"
1|
1|"Well, I don't know. It's awkward and would make me ashamed."
1|
1|"And I know why she'd be ashamed," said Petya, offended by Natasha's
1|previous remark. "It's because she was in love with that fat one in
1|spectacles" (that was how Petya described his namesake, the new
1|Count Bezukhov) "and now she's in love with that singer" (he meant
1|Natasha's Italian singing master), "that's why she's ashamed!"
1|
1|"Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natasha.
1|
1|"Not more stupid than you, madam," said the nine-year-old Petya,
1|with the air of an old brigadier.
1|
1|The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylovna's hints at
1|dinner. On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her
1|eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a
1|snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikhaylovna,
1|with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess' door and paused.
1|
1|"Don't come in," she said to the old count who was following her.
1|"Come later." And she went in, closing the door behind her.
1|
1|The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
1|
1|At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna
1|Mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then
1|silence, then both voices together with glad intonations, and then
1|footsteps. Anna Mikhaylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud
1|expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation
1|and admits the public to appreciate his skill.
1|
1|"It is done!" she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the
1|countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait
1|and in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her
1|lips.
1|
1|When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him,
1|embraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter
1|and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she
1|slightly pushed away the bald head. Vera, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya
1|now entered the room, and the reading of the letter began. After a
1|brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he
1|had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his
1|father's and mother's hands asking for their blessing, and that he
1|kissed Vera, Natasha, and Petya. Besides that, he sent greetings to
1|Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them
1|to kiss for him "dear Sonya, whom he loved and thought of just the
1|same as ever." When she heard this Sonya blushed so that tears came
1|into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran
1|away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her
1|dress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped
1|down on the floor. The countess was crying.
1|
1|"Why are you crying, Mamma?" asked Vera. "From all he says one
1|should be glad and not cry."
1|
1|This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natasha looked
1|at her reproachfully. "And who is it she takes after?" thought the
1|countess.
1|
1|Nicholas' letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were
1|considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she
1|did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses,
1|and Dmitri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the
1|letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it
1|fresh proofs of Nikolenka's virtues. How strange, how extraordinary,
1|how joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of
1|whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son
1|about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count,
1|that son who had first learned to say "pear" and then "granny," that
1|this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange
1|surroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man's work of his
1|own, without help or guidance. The universal experience of ages,
1|showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to
1|manhood, did not exist for the countess. Her son's growth toward
1|manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her
1|as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up
1|in the same way. As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the
1|little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry,
1|suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not believe that
1|that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model son
1|and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.
1|
1|"What a style! How charmingly he describes!" said she, reading the
1|descriptive part of the letter. "And what a soul! Not a word about
1|himself.... Not a word! About some Denisov or other, though he
1|himself, I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about
1|his sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has
1|remembered everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was
1|only so high--I always said...."
1|
1|For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of
1|letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied
1|out, while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of
1|the count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and
1|equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna
1|Mikhaylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor
1|with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication
1|for herself and her son. She had opportunities of sending her
1|letters to the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who commanded the
1|Guards. The Rostovs supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was
1|quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached the Grand
1|Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not
1|reach the Pavlograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the
1|same neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the letters and money
1|by the Grand Duke's courier to Boris and Boris was to forward them
1|to Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess, Petya,
1|Vera, Natasha, and Sonya, and finally there were six thousand rubles
1|for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son.
1|

1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov's active army, in camp before
1|Olmutz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors--the
1|Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia,
1|spent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come
1|straight to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.
1|
1|That day Nicholas Rostov received a letter from Boris, telling him
1|that the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles
1|from Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money
1|for him. Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops,
1|after their active service, were stationed near Olmutz and the camp
1|swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all
1|sorts of tempting wares. The Pavlograds held feast after feast,
1|celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made
1|expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who
1|had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.
1|Rostov, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought
1|Denisov's horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and
1|the sutlers. On receiving Boris' letter he rode with a fellow
1|officer to Olmutz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set
1|off alone to the Guards' camp to find his old playmate. Rostov had not
1|yet had time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket,
1|decorated with a soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding
1|breeches lined with worn leather, and an officer's saber with a
1|sword knot. The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a
1|Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck
1|jauntily back on one side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he
1|thought how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the
1|Guards by his appearance--that of a fighting hussar who had been under
1|fire.
1|
1|The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip,
1|parading their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy
1|stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian
1|authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every
1|halting place. The regiments had entered and left the town with
1|their bands playing, and by the Grand Duke's orders the men had
1|marched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards prided
1|themselves), the officers on foot and at their proper posts. Boris had
1|been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already
1|in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during
1|the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his
1|promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very
1|satisfactorily. Boris, during the campaign, had made the
1|acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a
1|letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become
1|acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkonski, through whom he hoped to
1|obtain a post on the commander in chief's staff. Berg and Boris,
1|having rested after yesterday's march, were sitting, clean and
1|neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to
1|them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.
1|Boris, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a
1|little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while
1|awaiting Berg's move, and watched his opponent's face, evidently
1|thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was
1|engaged on.
1|
1|"Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.
1|
1|"We'll try to," replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing
1|his hand.
1|
1|At that moment the door opened.
1|
1|"Here he is at last!" shouted Rostov. "And Berg too! Oh, you
1|petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!" he exclaimed, imitating his Russian
1|nurse's French, at which he and Boris used to laugh long ago.
1|
1|"Dear me, how you have changed!"
1|
1|Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to steady
1|and replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace
1|his friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of
1|youth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a
1|manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere,
1|Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He
1|wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him--a thing
1|everybody did. But notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a
1|quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.
1|
1|They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when
1|young men take their first steps on life's road, each saw immense
1|changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which
1|they had taken those first steps. Both had changed greatly since
1|they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had
1|taken place in them.
1|
1|"Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete,
1|not like us sinners of the line," cried Rostov, with martial swagger
1|and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Boris, pointing to his
1|own mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostov's
1|loud voice, popped her head in at the door.
1|
1|"Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink.
1|
1|"Why do you shout so? You'll frighten them!" said Boris. "I did
1|not expect you today," he added. "I only sent you the note yesterday
1|by Bolkonski--an adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a friend of mine. I
1|did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?
1|Been under fire already?" asked Boris.
1|
1|Without answering, Rostov shook the soldier's Cross of St. George
1|fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,
1|glanced at Berg with a smile.
1|
1|"As you see," he said.
1|
1|"Indeed? Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile. "And we too have had a
1|splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode
1|with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every
1|advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I
1|can't tell you. And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our
1|officers."
1|
1|And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of
1|his hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the
1|pleasures and advantages of service under members of the Imperial
1|family.
1|
1|"Oh, you Guards!" said Rostov. "I say, send for some wine."
1|
1|Boris made a grimace.
1|
1|"If you really want it," said he.
1|
1|He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and
1|sent for wine.
1|
1|"Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you," he added.
1|
1|Rostov took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both
1|arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he
1|glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind
1|the letter.
1|
1|"Well, they've sent you a tidy sum," said Berg, eying the heavy
1|purse that sank into the sofa. "As for us, Count, we get along on
1|our pay. I can tell you for myself..."
1|
1|"I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rostov, "when you get a letter
1|from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk
1|everything over with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be
1|out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!" he
1|exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking
1|amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his
1|words, he added, "Don't be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from
1|my heart as to an old acquaintance."
1|
1|"Oh, don't mention it, Count! I quite understand," said Berg,
1|getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.
1|
1|"Go across to our hosts: they invited you," added Boris.
1|
1|Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of
1|dust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
1|upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having
1|assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that his coat had
1|been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.
1|
1|"Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Rostov, as he read the
1|letter.
1|
1|"Why?"
1|
1|"Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them
1|such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!" he repeated, flushing suddenly.
1|"Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let's have
1|some!"
1|
1|In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of
1|recommendation to Bagration which the old countess at Anna
1|Mikhaylovna's advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent
1|to her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of
1|it.
1|
1|"What nonsense! Much I need it!" said Rostov, throwing the letter
1|under the table.
1|
1|"Why have you thrown that away?" asked Boris.
1|
1|"It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want
1|it for!"
1|
1|"Why 'What the devil'?" said Boris, picking it up and reading the
1|address. "This letter would be of great use to you."
1|
1|"I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant."
1|
1|"Why not?" inquired Boris.
1|
1|"It's a lackey's job!"
1|
1|"You are still the same dreamer, I see," remarked Boris, shaking his
1|head.
1|
1|"And you're still the same diplomatist! But that's not the
1|point... Come, how are you?" asked Rostov.
1|
1|"Well, as you see. So far everything's all right, but I confess I
1|should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front."
1|
1|"Why?"
1|
1|"Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try
1|to make as successful a career of it as possible."
1|
1|"Oh, that's it!" said Rostov, evidently thinking of something else.
1|
1|He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, evidently
1|trying in vain to find the answer to some question.
1|
1|Old Gabriel brought in the wine.
1|
1|"Shouldn't we now send for Berg?" asked Boris. "He would drink
1|with you. I can't."
1|
1|"Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?"
1|asked Rostov, with a contemptuous smile.
1|
1|"He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow," answered
1|Boris.
1|
1|Again Rostov looked intently into Boris' eyes and sighed. Berg
1|returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three
1|officers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostov of their march and
1|how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They
1|spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke,
1|and told stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual,
1|kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in
1|connection with the stories of the Grand Duke's quick temper he
1|related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the
1|Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was
1|annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With a pleasant smile
1|Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent
1|passion, shouting: "Arnauts!" ("Arnauts" was the Tsarevich's
1|favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the
1|company commander.
1|
1|"Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I
1|knew I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know
1|the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do
1|the Lord's Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my
1|company, and so my conscience was at ease. I came forward...." (Berg
1|stood up and showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his
1|cap, and really it would have been difficult for a face to express
1|greater respect and self-complacency than his did.) "Well, he
1|stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It
1|was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is.
1|'Albanians!' and 'devils!' and 'To Siberia!'" said Berg with a
1|sagacious smile. "I knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was
1|not that best, Count?... 'Hey, are you dumb?' he shouted. Still I
1|remained silent. And what do you think, Count? The next day it was not
1|even mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That's what keeping one's
1|head means. That's the way, Count," said Berg, lighting his pipe and
1|emitting rings of smoke.
1|
1|"Yes, that was fine," said Rostov, smiling.
1|
1|But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and
1|skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and
1|where he got his wound. This pleased Rostov and he began talking about
1|it, and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of
1|his Schon Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a
1|battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to
1|have been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds
1|well, but not at all as it really was. Rostov was a truthful young man
1|and would on no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story
1|meaning to tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly,
1|involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told
1|the truth to his hearers--who like himself had often heard stories
1|of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and
1|were expecting to hear just such a story--they would either not have
1|believed him or, still worse, would have thought that Rostov was
1|himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of
1|cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply
1|that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and
1|sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman
1|into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it
1|would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only
1|what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young
1|people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how
1|beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a
1|storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his
1|saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And
1|so he told them all that.
1|
1|In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: "You cannot
1|imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,"
1|Prince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered the room. Prince
1|Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked
1|for his assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had
1|managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young
1|man wanted. Having been sent with papers from Kutuzov to the
1|Tsarevich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to find him alone. When he
1|came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits
1|(Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he gave Boris a
1|pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at
1|Rostov, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the
1|sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company.
1|Rostov flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was a
1|mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too
1|seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.
1|
1|In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of
1|the contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army point of
1|view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the
1|newcomer was evidently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and
1|became silent. Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff,
1|and what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.
1|
1|"We shall probably advance," replied Bolkonski, evidently
1|reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.
1|
1|Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as
1|was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies
1|would be doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that
1|he could give no opinion on such an important government order, and
1|Berg laughed gaily.
1|
1|"As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris,
1|"we will talk of it later" (and he looked round at Rostov). "Come to
1|me after the review and we will do what is possible."
1|
1|And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to
1|Rostov, whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now
1|changing to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: "I
1|think you were talking of the Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?"
1|
1|"I was there," said Rostov angrily, as if intending to insult the
1|aide-de-camp.
1|
1|Bolkonski noticed the hussar's state of mind, and it amused him.
1|With a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: "Yes, there are many
1|stories now told about that affair!"
1|
1|"Yes, stories!" repeated Rostov loudly, looking with eyes suddenly
1|grown furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski. "Yes, many stories! But
1|our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's
1|fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those
1|fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!"
1|
1|"Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet
1|and particularly amiable smile.
1|
1|A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this
1|man's self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostov's soul.
1|
1|"I am not talking about you," he said, "I don't know you and,
1|frankly, I don't want to. I am speaking of the staff in general."
1|
1|"And I will tell you this," Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of
1|quiet authority, "you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree
1|with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven't sufficient
1|self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen.
1|In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more
1|serious duel, and besides, Drubetskoy, who says he is an old friend of
1|yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to
1|displease you. However," he added rising, "you know my name and
1|where to find me, but don't forget that I do not regard either
1|myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older
1|than you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday
1|after the review I shall expect you, Drubetskoy. Au revoir!" exclaimed
1|Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.
1|
1|Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostov think of what he ought
1|to have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it.
1|He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode
1|home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that
1|affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question
1|that worried him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he
1|would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud
1|man when covered by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of
1|all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a
1|friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated.
1|

1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|The day after Rostov had been to see Boris, a review was held of the
1|Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia
1|and those who had been campaigning under Kutuzov. The two Emperors,
1|the Russian with his heir the Tsarevich, and the Austrian with the
1|Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.
1|
1|From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up
1|on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets
1|moved and halted at the officers' command, turned with banners flying,
1|formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of
1|infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of
1|hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green
1|braided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on
1|black, roan, or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen
1|clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun
1|carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which
1|crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed
1|position. Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their
1|thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed
1|into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their
1|decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier
1|with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and
1|polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone
1|like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth--felt that no
1|small matter was happening, but an important and solemn affair. Every
1|general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance,
1|aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same
1|time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole.
1|
1|From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by
1|ten o'clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were
1|drawn up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three
1|lines: the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind
1|that again the infantry.
1|
1|A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The
1|three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutuzov's
1|fighting army (with the Pavlograds on the right flank of the front);
1|those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the
1|line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines,
1|under one command, and in a like order.
1|
1|Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: "They're coming!
1|They're coming!" Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final
1|preparation swept over all the troops.
1|
1|From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was seen
1|approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light
1|gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on
1|the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their
1|staffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was
1|expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was
1|heard shouting: "Eyes front!" Then, like the crowing of cocks at
1|sunrise, this was repeated by others from various sides and all became
1|silent.
1|
1|In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard.
1|This was the Emperors' suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank,
1|and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general
1|march. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as
1|if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had naturally
1|burst into music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of
1|the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of
1|greeting, and the first regiment roared "Hurrah!" so deafeningly,
1|continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by
1|their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.
1|
1|Rostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov's army which the Tsar
1|approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in
1|that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of
1|might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
1|triumph.
1|
1|He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass
1|(and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and
1|water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and
1|so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence
1|of that word.
1|
1|"Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" thundered from all sides, one regiment
1|after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and
1|then "Hurrah!"... Then the general march, and again "Hurrah!
1|Hurrah!" growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening
1|roar.
1|
1|Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and
1|immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it
1|became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along
1|which he had already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar
1|of those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing
1|motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the
1|suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in
1|front of them two men--the Emperors. Upon them the undivided,
1|tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was
1|concentrated.
1|
1|The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse
1|Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his
1|pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone's
1|attention.
1|
1|Rostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight
1|had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within
1|twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of
1|his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling tenderness
1|and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every
1|movement of the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting.
1|
1|Stopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said something in
1|French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.
1|
1|Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a
1|still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show
1|that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready
1|to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few
1|words to him.
1|
1|"Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?"
1|thought Rostov. "I should die of happiness!"
1|
1|The Tsar addressed the officers also: "I thank you all, gentlemen, I
1|thank you with my whole heart." To Rostov every word sounded like a
1|voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!
1|
1|"You have earned the St. George's standards and will be worthy of
1|them."
1|
1|"Oh, to die, to die for him," thought Rostov.
1|
1|The Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hear, and the
1|soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted "Hurrah!"
1|
1|Rostov too, bending over his saddle, shouted "Hurrah!" with all
1|his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout,
1|if only to express his rapture fully.
1|
1|The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if
1|undecided.
1|
1|"How can the Emperor be undecided?" thought Rostov, but then even
1|this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like
1|everything else the Tsar did.
1|
1|That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar's foot, in the
1|narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the
1|bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up
1|the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying
1|sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at
1|other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to
1|Rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.
1|
1|Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonski,
1|sitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostov recalled their
1|quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he
1|ought or ought not to challenge Bolkonski. "Of course not!" he now
1|thought. "Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment?
1|At a time of such love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do
1|any of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love and forgive
1|everybody now."
1|
1|When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began
1|a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov on Bedouin, recently purchased
1|from Denisov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron--that is,
1|alone and in full view of the Emperor.
1|
1|Before he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman,
1|spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in
1|which the animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to
1|his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the
1|Emperor's eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a
1|high and graceful action, as if flying through the air without
1|touching the ground.
1|
1|Rostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and
1|feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a
1|frowning but blissful face "like a vewy devil," as Denisov expressed
1|it.
1|
1|"Fine fellows, the Pavlograds!" remarked the Emperor.
1|
1|"My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the
1|fire this instant!" thought Rostov.
1|
1|When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also
1|Kutuzov's, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards,
1|about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about
1|Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if
1|the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.
1|
1|But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander.
1|His every word and movement was described with ecstasy.
1|
1|They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against
1|the enemy under the Emperor's command. Commanded by the Emperor
1|himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might:
1|so thought Rostov and most of the officers after the review.
1|
1|All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two
1|battles would have made them.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|The day after the review, Boris, in his best uniform and with his
1|comrade Berg's best wishes for success, rode to Olmutz to see
1|Bolkonski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for
1|himself the best post he could--preferably that of adjutant to some
1|important personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most
1|attractive. "It is all very well for Rostov, whose father sends him
1|ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe
1|to anybody and not be anyone's lackey, but I who have nothing but my
1|brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must
1|avail myself of them!" he reflected.
1|
1|He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmutz that day, but the appearance
1|of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were
1|stationed and the two Emperors were living with their suites,
1|households, and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to
1|that higher world.
1|
1|He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman's uniform, all these
1|exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
1|with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military
1|men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the
1|Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be
1|aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief,
1|Kutuzov, where he inquired for Bolkonski, all the adjutants and even
1|the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a
1|great many officers like him were always coming there and that
1|everybody was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather
1|because of it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to
1|Olmutz and, entering the house occupied by Kutuzov, asked for
1|Bolkonski. Prince Andrew was in and Boris was shown into a large
1|hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now
1|stood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, and a
1|clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table
1|in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, stout
1|Nesvitski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an
1|officer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese
1|waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang
1|the tune. Bolkonski was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his
1|position on seeing Boris. The one who was writing and whom Boris
1|addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkonski was on duty
1|and that he should go through the door on the left into the
1|reception room if he wished to see him. Boris thanked him and went
1|to the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.
1|
1|When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously
1|(with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says,
1|"If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment"), was
1|listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very
1|erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier's obsequious expression on his
1|purple face, reporting something.
1|
1|"Very well, then, be so good as to wait," said Prince Andrew to
1|the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he
1|affected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Boris,
1|Prince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him
1|imploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with
1|a cheerful smile.
1|
1|At that moment Boris clearly realized what he had before surmised,
1|that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline
1|prescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the
1|regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made
1|this tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain
1|Prince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant
1|Drubetskoy. More than ever was Boris resolved to serve in future not
1|according to the written code, but under this unwritten law. He felt
1|now that merely by having been recommended to Prince Andrew he had
1|already risen above the general who at the front had the power to
1|annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards. Prince Andrew came up to
1|him and took his hand.
1|
1|"I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing
1|about with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the
1|dispositions. When Germans start being accurate, there's no end to
1|it!"
1|
1|Boris smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to
1|as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard
1|Weyrother's name, or even the term "dispositions."
1|
1|"Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have
1|been thinking about you."
1|
1|"Yes, I was thinking"--for some reason Boris could not help
1|blushing--"of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter
1|from Prince Kuragin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear
1|the Guards won't be in action," he added as if in apology.
1|
1|"All right, all right. We'll talk it over," replied Prince Andrew.
1|"Only let me report this gentleman's business, and I shall be at
1|your disposal."
1|
1|While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general,
1|that gentleman--evidently not sharing Boris' conception of the
1|advantages of the unwritten code of subordination--looked so fixedly
1|at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he
1|had to say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfortable. He turned
1|away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew's return from the
1|commander in chief's room.
1|
1|"You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you," said
1|Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the
1|clavichord was. "It's no use your going to the commander in chief.
1|He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner" ("That would
1|not be bad as regards the unwritten code," thought Boris), "but
1|nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us
1|aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we'll do: I have a
1|good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince
1|Dolgorukov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now
1|Kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything
1|is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorukov; I have
1|to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We
1|shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place
1|for you somewhere nearer the sun."
1|
1|Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a
1|young man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining
1|help of this kind for another, which from pride he would never
1|accept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers
1|success and which attracted him. He very readily took up Boris'
1|cause and went with him to Dolgorukov.
1|
1|It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz
1|occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.
1|
1|That same day a council of war had been held in which all the
1|members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that
1|council, contrary to the views of the old generals Kutuzov and
1|Prince Schwartzenberg, it had been decided to advance immediately
1|and give battle to Bonaparte. The council of war was just over when
1|Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris arrived at the palace to find
1|Dolgorukov. Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of
1|the day's council, at which the party of the young had triumphed.
1|The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for
1|something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and
1|their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages
1|of attacking that what had been discussed at the council--the coming
1|battle and the victory that would certainly result from it--no
1|longer seemed to be in the future but in the past. All the
1|advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior
1|to Napoleon's, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired
1|by the Emperors' presence were eager for action. The strategic
1|position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its
1|details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had
1|ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on
1|the very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent
1|locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and
1|Bonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.
1|
1|Dolgorukov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just
1|returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud
1|of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his
1|protege, but Prince Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand
1|said nothing to Boris and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts
1|which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince
1|Andrew in French.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that
1|the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However,
1|dear fellow," he said abruptly and eagerly, "I must confess to
1|having been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother.
1|What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what
1|foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the
1|smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our
1|present ones could have been devised. This combination of Austrian
1|precision with Russian valor--what more could be wished for?"
1|
1|"So the attack is definitely resolved on?" asked Bolkonski.
1|
1|"And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte
1|has decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received
1|from him today for the Emperor." Dolgorukov smiled significantly.
1|
1|"Is that so? And what did he say?" inquired Bolkonski.
1|
1|"What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain
1|time. I tell you he is in our hands, that's certain! But what was most
1|amusing," he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, "was that
1|we could not think how to address the reply! If not as 'Consul' and of
1|course not as 'Emperor,' it seemed to me it should be to 'General
1|Bonaparte.'"
1|
1|"But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him
1|General Bonaparte, there is a difference," remarked Bolkonski.
1|
1|"That's just it," interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, laughing. "You
1|know Bilibin--he's a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him
1|as 'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.'"
1|
1|Dolgorukov laughed merrily.
1|
1|"Only that?" said Bolkonski.
1|
1|"All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the
1|address. He is a wise and clever fellow."
1|
1|"What was it?"
1|
1|"To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement
1|francais," said Dolgorukov, with grave satisfaction. "Good, wasn't
1|it?"
1|
1|"Yes, but he will dislike it extremely," said Bolkonski.
1|
1|"Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he's dined with him--the
1|present Emperor--more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met
1|a more cunning or subtle diplomatist--you know, a combination of
1|French adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale
1|about him and Count Markov? Count Markov was the only man who knew how
1|to handle him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is
1|delightful!"
1|
1|And the talkative Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, now to Prince
1|Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markov, our ambassador,
1|purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking
1|at Markov, probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him, and how
1|Markov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up
1|without touching Bonaparte's.
1|
1|"Delightful!" said Bolkonski. "But I have come to you, Prince, as
1|a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see..." but before
1|Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon
1|Dolgorukov to the Emperor.
1|
1|"Oh, what a nuisance," said Dolgorukov, getting up hurriedly and
1|pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris. "You know I should be
1|very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
1|man." Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
1|good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. "But you see... another
1|time!"
1|
1|Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher
1|powers as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious
1|that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the
1|enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt
1|himself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince
1|Dolgorukov out into the corridor and met--coming out of the door of
1|the Emperor's room by which Dolgorukov had entered--a short man in
1|civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw
1|which, without spoiling his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and
1|shiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an
1|intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity,
1|walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to
1|step out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity
1|appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the
1|side of the corridor.
1|
1|"Who was that?" asked Boris.
1|
1|"He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of
1|men--the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski.... It
1|is such men as he who decide the fate of nations," added Bolkonski
1|with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.
1|
1|Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle
1|of Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either Prince Andrew or
1|Dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denisov's squadron, in which
1|Nicholas Rostov served and which was in Prince Bagration's detachment,
1|moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing into
1|action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for about two
1|thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. Rostov saw the
1|Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and
1|infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then
1|Generals Bagration and Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants.
1|All the fear before action which he had experienced as previously, all
1|the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of
1|distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been
1|wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostov spent
1|that day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard
1|firing in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought
1|back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole
1|detachment of French cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sotnya
1|of Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, though not big, had
1|been a successful engagement. The men and officers returning spoke
1|of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and
1|the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny
1|after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day
1|was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed, not only
1|by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful
1|expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and
1|adjutants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. And Nicholas, who
1|had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent
1|that happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.
1|
1|"Come here, Wostov. Let's dwink to dwown our gwief!" shouted
1|Denisov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some
1|food.
1|
1|The officers gathered round Denisov's canteen, eating and talking.
1|
1|"There! They are bringing another!" cried one of the officers,
1|indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot
1|by two Cossacks.
1|
1|One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he
1|had taken from the prisoner.
1|
1|"Sell us that horse!" Denisov called out to the Cossacks.
1|
1|"If you like, your honor!"
1|
1|The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.
1|The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German
1|accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when
1|he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,
1|addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been
1|taken, it was not his fault but the corporal's who had sent him to
1|seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were
1|there. And at every word he added: "But don't hurt my little horse!"
1|and stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where
1|he was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now,
1|imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly
1|discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our
1|rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which
1|was so alien to us.
1|
1|The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostov, being
1|the richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought
1|it.
1|
1|"But don't hurt my little horse!" said the Alsatian good-naturedly
1|to Rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar.
1|
1|Rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.
1|
1|"Alley! Alley!" said the Cossack, touching the prisoner's arm to
1|make him go on.
1|
1|"The Emperor! The Emperor!" was suddenly heard among the hussars.
1|
1|All began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up the road
1|behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment
1|everyone was in his place, waiting.
1|
1|Rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.
1|Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected
1|mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every
1|thought of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his
1|nearness to the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made
1|up to him for the day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the
1|longed-for moment of meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and
1|without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of his
1|approach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the
1|approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything grew
1|brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive around
1|him. Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding beams of
1|mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself
1|enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and
1|majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with
1|Rostov's feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard
1|the Emperor's voice.
1|
1|"The Pavlograd hussars?" he inquired.
1|
1|"The reserves, sire!" replied a voice, a very human one compared
1|to that which had said: "The Pavlograd hussars?"
1|
1|The Emperor drew level with Rostov and halted. Alexander's face
1|was even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the
1|review. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that
1|it suggested the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was
1|the face of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the
1|squadron, the Emperor's eyes met Rostov's and rested on them for not
1|more than two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was
1|going on in Rostov's soul (it seemed to Rostov that he understood
1|everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two
1|seconds into Rostov's face. A gentle, mild light poured from them.
1|Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse
1|with his left foot, and galloped on.
1|
1|The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
1|battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at
1|twelve o'clock left the third column with which he had been and
1|galloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars,
1|several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the
1|action.
1|
1|This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron,
1|was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the
1|Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the
1|battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were
1|retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had
1|passed, the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau
1|itself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the Emperor again. In the
1|market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
1|Emperor's arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom
1|there had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his
1|suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare,
1|a different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and
1|bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes
1|and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered
1|head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his
1|proximity to the Emperor shocked Rostov. Rostov saw how the
1|Emperor's rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run
1|down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse's
1|side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round
1|unconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the
1|soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been
1|brought. The soldier groaned.
1|
1|"Gently, gently! Can't you do it more gently?" said the Emperor
1|apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.
1|
1|Rostov saw tears filling the Emperor's eyes and heard him, as he was
1|riding away, say to Czartoryski: "What a terrible thing war is: what a
1|terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!"
1|
1|The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within
1|sight of the enemy's lines, which all day long had yielded ground to
1|us at the least firing. The Emperor's gratitude was announced to the
1|vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double
1|ration of vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiers' songs
1|resounded even more merrily than on the previous night. Denisov
1|celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rostov, who had
1|already drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor's
1|health. "Not 'our Sovereign, the Emperor,' as they say at official
1|dinners," said he, "but the health of our Sovereign, that good,
1|enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the
1|certain defeat of the French!"
1|
1|"If we fought before," he said, "not letting the French pass, as
1|at Schon Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We
1|will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not
1|saying it right, I have drunk a good deal--but that is how I feel, and
1|so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!"
1|
1|"Hurrah!" rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.
1|
1|And the old cavalry captain, Kirsten, shouted enthusiastically and
1|no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostov.
1|
1|When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten
1|filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand
1|to the soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white
1|chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the
1|light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.
1|
1|"Lads! here's to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our
1|enemies! Hurrah!" he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar's baritone.
1|
1|The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.
1|
1|Late that night, when all had separated, Denisov with his short hand
1|patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.
1|
1|"As there's no one to fall in love with on campaign, he's fallen
1|in love with the Tsar," he said.
1|
1|"Denisov, don't make fun of it!" cried Rostov. "It is such a
1|lofty, beautiful feeling, such a..."
1|
1|"I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove..."
1|
1|"No, you don't understand!"
1|
1|And Rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming
1|of what happiness it would be to die--not in saving the Emperor's life
1|(he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before
1|his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the
1|Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only
1|man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding
1|the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army
1|were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the
1|glory of the Russian arms.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his
1|physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and
1|among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was
1|unwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around
1|him reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong
1|impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and
1|wounded.
1|
1|At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a
1|flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was
1|brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The
1|Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At
1|midday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off
1|with Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army.
1|
1|It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a
1|meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a
1|personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince
1|Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate
1|with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were
1|actuated by a real desire for peace.
1|
1|Toward evening Dolgorukov came back, went straight to the Tsar,
1|and remained alone with him for a long time.
1|
1|On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced
1|two days' march and the enemy's outposts after a brief interchange
1|of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the
1|nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted
1|till the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of
1|Austerlitz was fought.
1|
1|Till midday on the nineteenth, the activity--the eager talk, running
1|to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants--was confined to the
1|Emperor's headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this
1|activity reached Kutuzov's headquarters and the staffs of the
1|commanders of columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread it to
1|all ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth
1|to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from
1|their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the army swayed and started
1|in one enormous mass six miles long.
1|
1|The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor's
1|headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that
1|followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large
1|tower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and
1|a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and
1|cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands
1|to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity.
1|
1|Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the
1|military machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and
1|just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is
1|transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse
1|has not yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage
1|one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their
1|movement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though
1|it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment
1|comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel
1|begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of
1|which are beyond its ken.
1|
1|Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of
1|innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement
1|of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated
1|human activities of 160,000 Russians and French--all their passions,
1|desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride,
1|fear, and enthusiasm--was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz,
1|the so-called battle of the three Emperors--that is to say, a slow
1|movement of the hand on the dial of human history.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
1|commander in chief.
1|
1|At six in the evening, Kutuzov went to the Emperor's headquarters
1|and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand
1|marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.
1|
1|Bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
1|coming action from Dolgorukov. He felt that Kutuzov was upset and
1|dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
1|dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor's headquarters
1|everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something
1|others do not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorukov.
1|
1|"Well, how d'you do, my dear fellow?" said Dolgorukov, who was
1|sitting at tea with Bilibin. "The fete is for tomorrow. How is your
1|old fellow? Out of sorts?"
1|
1|"I won't say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be
1|heard."
1|
1|"But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when
1|he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when
1|Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible."
1|
1|"Yes, you have seen him?" said Prince Andrew. "Well, what is
1|Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?"
1|
1|"Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a
1|general engagement," repeated Dolgorukov, evidently prizing this
1|general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with
1|Napoleon. "If he weren't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that
1|interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat
1|is so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is
1|afraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!"
1|
1|"But tell me, what is he like, eh?" said Prince Andrew again.
1|
1|"He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him
1|'Your Majesty,' but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me!
1|That's the sort of man he is, and nothing more," replied Dolgorukov,
1|looking round at Bilibin with a smile.
1|
1|"Despite my great respect for old Kutuzov," he continued, "we should
1|be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a
1|chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in
1|our hands! No, we mustn't forget Suvorov and his rule--not to put
1|yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe
1|me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than
1|all the experience of old Cunctators."
1|
1|"But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the
1|outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces
1|are situated," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|He wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself
1|formed.
1|
1|"Oh, that is all the same," Dolgorukov said quickly, and getting
1|up he spread a map on the table. "All eventualities have been
1|foreseen. If he is standing before Brunn..."
1|
1|And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother's
1|plan of a flanking movement.
1|
1|Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which
1|might have been as good as Weyrother's, but for the disadvantage
1|that Weyrother's had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew
1|began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his
1|own plan, Prince Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed
1|absent-mindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrew's face.
1|
1|"There will be a council of war at Kutuzov's tonight, though; you
1|can say all this there," remarked Dolgorukov.
1|
1|"I will do so," said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.
1|
1|"Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?" said Bilibin, who,
1|till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and
1|now was evidently ready with a joke. "Whether tomorrow brings
1|victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except
1|your Kutuzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column!
1|The commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le
1|Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally
1|Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish names."
1|
1|"Be quiet, backbiter!" said Dolgorukov. "It is not true; there are
1|now two Russians, Miloradovich, and Dokhturov, and there would be a
1|third, Count Arakcheev, if his nerves were not too weak."
1|
1|"However, I think General Kutuzov has come out," said Prince Andrew.
1|"I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!" he added and went out
1|after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin.
1|
1|On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking
1|Kutuzov, who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of
1|tomorrow's battle.
1|
1|Kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause,
1|replied: "I think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstoy
1|and asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? 'But,
1|my dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after
1|military matters yourself!' Yes... That was the answer I got!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|Shortly after nine o'clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his
1|plans to Kutuzov's quarters where the council of war was to be held.
1|All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in
1|chief's and with the exception of Prince Bagration, who declined to
1|come, were all there at the appointed time.
1|
1|Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his
1|eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the
1|dissatisfied and drowsy Kutuzov, who reluctantly played the part of
1|chairman and president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt
1|himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become
1|unrestrainable. He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a
1|heavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not
1|know, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what
1|this movement might lead to. Weyrother had been twice that evening
1|to the enemy's picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the
1|Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his
1|headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and
1|now, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutuzov's.
1|
1|He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
1|commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and
1|indistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, and did
1|not reply to questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had
1|a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was
1|haughty and self-confident.
1|
1|Kutuzov was occupying a nobleman's castle of modest dimensions
1|near Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the
1|commander in chief's office were gathered Kutuzov himself,
1|Weyrother, and the members of the council of war. They were drinking
1|tea, and only awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council. At last
1|Bagration's orderly came with the news that the prince could not
1|attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this
1|and, availing himself of permission previously given him by Kutuzov to
1|be present at the council, he remained in the room.
1|
1|"Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin," said
1|Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on
1|which an enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out.
1|
1|Kutuzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged
1|over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low
1|chair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms.
1|At the sound of Weyrother's voice, he opened his one eye with an
1|effort.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late," said he, and
1|nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.
1|
1|If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was
1|pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading
1|that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was
1|absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his
1|contempt for the dispositions or anything else--he was engaged in
1|satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was
1|asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a
1|moment, glanced at Kutuzov and, having convinced himself that he was
1|asleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous voice began to
1|read out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading
1|which he also read out:
1|
1|"Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz
1|and Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805."
1|
1|The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began
1|as follows:
1|
1|"As the enemy's left wing rests on wooded hills and his right
1|extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there,
1|while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his
1|right, it is advantageous to attack the enemy's latter wing especially
1|if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can
1|both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between
1|Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of
1|Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy's front. For this
1|object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The
1|second column marches... The third column marches..." and so on,
1|read Weyrother.
1|
1|The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult
1|dispositions. The tall, fair-haired General Buxhowden stood, leaning
1|his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and
1|seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen.
1|Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed
1|upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy
1|Miloradovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands
1|on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent,
1|gazing at Weyrother's face, and only turned away his eyes when the
1|Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Miloradovich looked
1|round significantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from
1|that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied
1|or not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron
1|who, with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French
1|face during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate
1|fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on
1|which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest sentences,
1|he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and
1|with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips
1|interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the Austrian
1|general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as
1|if to say: "You can tell me your views later, but now be so good as to
1|look at the map and listen." Langeron lifted his eyes with an
1|expression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking
1|an explanation, but meeting the latter's impressive but meaningless
1|gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.
1|
1|"A geography lesson!" he muttered as if to himself, but loud
1|enough to be heard.
1|
1|Przebyszewski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his
1|hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in
1|attention. Dohkturov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an
1|assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map
1|conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar
1|locality. He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had
1|not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother
1|complied and Dohkturov noted them down.
1|
1|When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron
1|again brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother
1|or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry
1|out such a plan in which the enemy's position was assumed to be known,
1|whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.
1|Langeron's objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief
1|aim was to show General Weyrother--who had read his dispositions with
1|as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children--that
1|he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him
1|something in military matters.
1|
1|When the monotonous sound of Weyrother's voice ceased, Kutuzov
1|opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the
1|mill wheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if
1|remarking, "So you are still at that silly business!" quickly closed
1|his eye again, and let his head sink still lower.
1|
1|Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother's
1|vanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might
1|easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of
1|this plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a
1|firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all
1|objections be they what they might.
1|
1|"If he could attack us, he would have done so today," said he.
1|
1|"So you think he is powerless?" said Langeron.
1|
1|"He has forty thousand men at most," replied Weyrother, with the
1|smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the
1|treatment of a case.
1|
1|"In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,"
1|said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round
1|for support to Miloradovich who was near him.
1|
1|But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
1|rather than of what the generals were disputing about.
1|
1|"Ma foi!" said he, "tomorrow we shall see all that on the
1|battlefield."
1|
1|Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it
1|was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals
1|and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced
1|himself of, but had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.
1|
1|"The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard
1|from his camp," said he. "What does that mean? Either he is
1|retreating, which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing
1|his position." (He smiled ironically.) "But even if he also took up
1|a position in the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of
1|trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the
1|same."
1|
1|"How is that?..." began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting
1|an opportunity to express his doubts.
1|
1|Kutuzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the
1|generals.
1|
1|"Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow--or rather for today,
1|for it is past midnight--cannot now be altered," said he. "You have
1|heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there
1|is nothing more important..." he paused, "than to have a good sleep."
1|
1|He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was
1|past midnight. Prince Andrew went out.
1|
1|
1|The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to
1|express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy
1|impression. Whether Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov, Langeron,
1|and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were
1|right--he did not know. "But was it really not possible for Kutuzov to
1|state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on account
1|of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and
1|my life, my life," he thought, "must be risked?"
1|
1|"Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow," he
1|thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of
1|most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he
1|remembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he
1|remembered the days when he first loved her. He thought of her
1|pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously
1|emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was
1|billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk up and down before it.
1|
1|The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
1|mysteriously. "Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!" he thought. "Tomorrow
1|everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more,
1|none of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even
1|certainly, I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have
1|to show all I can do." And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss,
1|the concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all
1|the commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he
1|had so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and
1|clearly expresses his opinion to Kutuzov, to Weyrother, and to the
1|Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one
1|undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a
1|division-stipulates that no one is to interfere with his
1|arrangements--leads his division to the decisive point, and gains the
1|victory alone. "But death and suffering?" suggested another voice.
1|Prince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on dreaming
1|of his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are planned by
1|him alone. Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzov's staff, but he
1|does everything alone. The next battle is won by him alone. Kutuzov is
1|removed and he is appointed... "Well and then?" asked the other voice.
1|"If before that you are not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed,
1|well... what then?..." "Well then," Prince Andrew answered himself, "I
1|don't know what will happen and don't want to know, and can't, but if
1|I want this--want glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by
1|them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and
1|live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone,
1|but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men's
1|esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family--I fear nothing. And
1|precious and dear as many persons are to me--father, sister,
1|wife--those dearest to me--yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I
1|would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over
1|men, of love from men I don't know and never shall know, for the love
1|of these men here," he thought, as he listened to voices in Kutuzov's
1|courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up;
1|one voice, probably a coachman's, was teasing Kutuzov's old cook whom
1|Prince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, "Tit, I
1|say, Tit!"
1|
1|"Well?" returned the old man.
1|
1|"Go, Tit, thresh a bit!" said the wag.
1|
1|"Oh, go to the devil!" called out a voice, drowned by the laughter
1|of the orderlies and servants.
1|
1|"All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I
1|value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in
1|this mist!"
1|
1|

1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|That same night, Rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in
1|front of Bagration's detachment. His hussars were placed along the
1|line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master
1|the sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with
1|our army's campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind
1|him; in front of him was misty darkness. Rostov could see nothing,
1|peer as he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray,
1|now there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer
1|where the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in
1|his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared--now
1|the Emperor, now Denisov, and now Moscow memories--and he again
1|hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears
1|of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six
1|paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was
1|still the same misty darkness. "Why not?... It might easily happen,"
1|thought Rostov, "that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as
1|he would to any other officer; he'll say: 'Go and find out what's
1|there.' There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in
1|just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave
1|me a place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him
1|the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!" And in order to
1|realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign, Rostov pictured to
1|himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill
1|with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor.
1|Suddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.
1|
1|"Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and
1|watchword--shaft, Olmutz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in
1|reserve tomorrow," he thought. "I'll ask leave to go to the front,
1|this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won't be long now
1|before I am off duty. I'll take another turn and when I get back
1|I'll go to the general and ask him." He readjusted himself in the
1|saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars.
1|It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a
1|sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as
1|steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostov
1|could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the
1|moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought
1|something moved on that white spot. "I expect it's snow... that
1|spot... a spot--une tache," he thought. "There now... it's not a
1|tache... Natasha... sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won't she be
1|surprised when I tell her how I've seen the Emperor?) Natasha...
1|take my sabretache..."--"Keep to the right, your honor, there are
1|bushes here," came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostov was riding
1|in the act of falling asleep. Rostov lifted his head that had sunk
1|almost to his horse's mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was
1|succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. "But what
1|was I thinking? I mustn't forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor?
1|No, that's not it--that's tomorrow. Oh yes! Natasha... sabretache...
1|saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches.
1|Along the Tverskaya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought
1|about him too, just opposite Guryev's house... Old Guryev.... Oh,
1|but Denisov's a fine fellow. But that's all nonsense. The chief
1|thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to
1|say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But
1|that's nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important
1|thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tasha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes!
1|That's right!" And his head once more sank to his horse's neck. All at
1|once it seemed to him that he was being fired at. "What? What?
1|What?... Cut them down! What?..." said Rostov, waking up. At the
1|moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him, where the
1|enemy was, the long-drawn shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and
1|the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts.
1|Over there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went
1|out again, then another, and all along the French line on the hill
1|fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder. Rostov
1|could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them.
1|The din of many voices was too great; all he could hear was: "ahahah!"
1|and "rrrr!"
1|
1|"What's that? What do you make of it?" said Rostov to the hussar
1|beside him. "That must be the enemy's camp!"
1|
1|The hussar did not reply.
1|
1|"Why, don't you hear it?" Rostov asked again, after waiting for a
1|reply.
1|
1|"Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hussar reluctantly.
1|
1|"From the direction, it must be the enemy," repeated Rostov.
1|
1|"It may be he or it may be nothing," muttered the hussar. "It's
1|dark... Steady!" he cried to his fidgeting horse.
1|
1|Rostov's horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,
1|pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting
1|grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
1|of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and
1|farther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rostov no
1|longer wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy
1|army had a stimulating effect on him. "Vive l'Empereur! L'Empereur!"
1|he now heard distinctly.
1|
1|"They can't be far off, probably just beyond the stream," he said to
1|the hussar beside him.
1|
1|The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The
1|sound of horse's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars
1|was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of
1|hussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.
1|
1|"Your honor, the generals!" said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov.
1|
1|Rostov, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode
1|with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the
1|line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov
1|with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the
1|lights and shouts in the enemy's camp. Rostov rode up to Bagration,
1|reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the
1|generals were saying.
1|
1|"Believe me," said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, "it is
1|nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
1|kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us."
1|
1|"Hardly," said Bagration. "I saw them this evening on that knoll; if
1|they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too....
1|Officer!" said Bagration to Rostov, "are the enemy's skirmishers still
1|there?"
1|
1|"They were there this evening, but now I don't know, your
1|excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?" replied
1|Rostov.
1|
1|Bagration stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostov's face
1|in the mist.
1|
1|"Well, go and see," he said, after a pause.
1|
1|"Yes, sir."
1|
1|Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other
1|hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the
1|direction from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and
1|pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and
1|dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him. Bagration
1|called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostov
1|pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on,
1|continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and
1|continually discovering his mistakes. Having descended the hill at a
1|trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy's fires, but
1|heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. In the
1|valley he saw before him something like a river, but when he reached
1|it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road he reined
1|in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride
1|over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which
1|gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be
1|easier to see people coming along it. "Follow me!" said he, crossed
1|the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point
1|where the French pickets had been standing that evening.
1|
1|"Your honor, there he is!" cried one of the hussars behind him.
1|And before Rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that
1|had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a
1|report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive
1|sound passed out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in
1|the pan. Rostov turned his horse and galloped back. Four more
1|reports followed at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the
1|fog singing in different tones. Rostov reined in his horse, whose
1|spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and went back at a
1|footpace. "Well, some more! Some more!" a merry voice was saying in
1|his soul. But no more shots came.
1|
1|Only when approaching Bagration did Rostov let his horse gallop
1|again, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.
1|
1|Dolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had
1|only lit fires to deceive us.
1|
1|"What does that prove?" he was saying as Rostov rode up. "They might
1|retreat and leave the pickets."
1|
1|"It's plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince," said
1|Bagration. "Wait till tomorrow morning, we'll find out everything
1|tomorrow."
1|
1|"The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was
1|in the evening," reported Rostov, stooping forward with his hand at
1|the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his
1|ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.
1|
1|"Very good, very good," said Bagration. "Thank you, officer."
1|
1|"Your excellency," said Rostov, "may I ask a favor?"
1|
1|"What is it?"
1|
1|"Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached
1|to the first squadron?"
1|
1|"What's your name?"
1|
1|"Count Rostov."
1|
1|"Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me."
1|
1|"Count Ilya Rostov's son?" asked Dolgorukov.
1|
1|But Rostov did not reply.
1|
1|"Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?"
1|
1|"I will give the order."
1|
1|"Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the
1|Emperor," thought Rostov.
1|
1|"Thank God!"
1|
1|
1|The fires and shouting in the enemy's army were occasioned by the
1|fact that while Napoleon's proclamation was being read to the troops
1|the Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing
1|him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, "Vive
1|l'Empereur!" Napoleon's proclamation was as follows:
1|
1|
1|Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
1|Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at
1|Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position
1|we occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round
1|me on the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will
1|myself direct your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with
1|your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy's
1|ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see
1|your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for
1|there must be no doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is
1|at stake is the honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the
1|honor of our nation.
1|
1|Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let
1|every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these
1|hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This
1|victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter
1|quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France
1|will join us, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my
1|people, of you, and of myself.

1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the
1|center, the reserves, and Bagration's right flank had not yet moved,
1|but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
1|which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French
1|right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to
1|plan, were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into
1|which they were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes
1|smart. It was cold and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking
1|tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a
1|tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the fires
1|throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels,
1|tubs, and everything that they did not want or could not carry away
1|with them. Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the
1|Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance. As soon as an
1|Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer's
1|quarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers ran from the fires,
1|thrust their pipes into their boots, their bags into the carts, got
1|their muskets ready, and formed rank. The officers buttoned up their
1|coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and moved along the
1|ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed
1|the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and
1|regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final
1|instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who
1|remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet
1|resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and
1|unable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog,
1|to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were
1|going.
1|
1|A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his
1|regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has
1|walked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches,
1|just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and
1|rigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same
1|comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the
1|same company dog Jack, and the same commanders. The sailor rarely
1|cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing, but on the
1|day of battle--heaven knows how and whence--a stern note of which
1|all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army,
1|announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn, and
1|awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of battle the
1|soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
1|regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning
1|what is going on around them.
1|
1|The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they
1|could not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and
1|level ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one
1|might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns
1|advanced for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and
1|ascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and
1|unknown ground, and nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary,
1|the soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides,
1|other Russian columns were moving in the same direction. Every soldier
1|felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going, many
1|more of our men were going too.
1|
1|"There now, the Kurskies have also gone past," was being said in the
1|ranks.
1|
1|"It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last
1|night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A
1|regular Moscow!"
1|
1|Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or
1|talked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war,
1|were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not
1|exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the
1|orders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going
1|into action, especially to an attack. But when they had marched for
1|about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part of the men had to
1|halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder
1|spread through the ranks. How such a consciousness is communicated
1|is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated very
1|surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as
1|water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any
1|allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before this
1|consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as
1|it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the
1|stupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had
1|been occasioned by the sausage eaters.
1|
1|"Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up
1|against the French?"
1|
1|"No, one can't hear them. They'd be firing if we had."
1|
1|"They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in
1|the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It's all those damned
1|Germans' muddling! What stupid devils!"
1|
1|"Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, they're crowding up
1|behind. And now here we stand hungry."
1|
1|"I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking
1|the way," said an officer.
1|
1|"Ah, those damned Germans! They don't know their own country!"
1|said another.
1|
1|"What division are you?" shouted an adjutant, riding up.
1|
1|"The Eighteenth."
1|
1|"Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you
1|won't get there till evening."
1|
1|"What stupid orders! They don't themselves know what they are
1|doing!" said the officer and rode off.
1|
1|Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.
1|
1|"Tafa-lafa! But what he's jabbering no one can make out," said a
1|soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. "I'd shoot them,
1|the scoundrels!"
1|
1|"We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven't
1|got halfway. Fine orders!" was being repeated on different sides.
1|
1|And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
1|turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
1|Germans.
1|
1|The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
1|moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center
1|was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
1|ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in
1|front of the infantry, who had to wait.
1|
1|At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a
1|Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry
1|should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher
1|command, was to blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and
1|dispirited. After an hour's delay they at last moved on, descending
1|the hill. The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more
1|densely below, where they were descending. In front in the fog a
1|shot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at varying
1|intervals--trata... tat--and then more and more regularly and rapidly,
1|and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.
1|
1|Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having
1|stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their
1|commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading
1|through the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front
1|or around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the
1|enemy lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders
1|from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in
1|those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this
1|way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which
1|had gone down into the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutuzov
1|was, stood on the Pratzen Heights.
1|
1|Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog;
1|on the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of
1|what was going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we
1|supposed, six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea
1|of mist, no one knew till after eight o'clock.
1|
1|It was nine o'clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a
1|sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where
1|Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above
1|him was a clear blue sky, and the sun's vast orb quivered like a
1|huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist.
1|The whole French army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff,
1|were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and
1|Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and
1|begin the action, but were on this side, so close to our own forces
1|that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man
1|from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his
1|Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front
1|of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise
1|out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving
1|in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of firing in the
1|valley. Not a single muscle of his face--which in those days was still
1|thin--moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His
1|predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian force had
1|already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
1|part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack
1|and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that
1|in a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian
1|columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one
1|direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
1|the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from
1|the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the
1|night, by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all
1|indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far
1|away in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen
1|constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center was
1|already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still
1|he did not begin the engagement.
1|
1|Today was a great day for him--the anniversary of his coronation.
1|Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and
1|in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in
1|that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything
1|succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above
1|the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident,
1|self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily
1|in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his
1|attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun
1|floating up out of the mist.
1|
1|When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and
1|mist were aglow with dazzling light--as if he had only awaited this to
1|begin the action--he drew the glove from his shapely white hand,
1|made a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to
1|begin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in
1|different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of
1|the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which
1|were being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving down the
1|valley to their left.
1|
1|

1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|At eight o'clock Kutuzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth
1|column, Miloradovich's, the one that was to take the place of
1|Przebyszewski's and Langeron's columns which had already gone down
1|into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and
1|gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to
1|lead that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen
1|he halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number
1|forming the commander in chief's suite. He was in a state of
1|suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm as a
1|man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment. He was firmly
1|convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of
1|Arcola. How it would come about he did not know, but he felt sure it
1|would do so. The locality and the position of our troops were known to
1|him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. His own
1|strategic plan, which obviously could not now be carried out, was
1|forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince Andrew
1|considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
1|might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.
1|
1|To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen
1|forces could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight
1|would concentrate. "There we shall encounter difficulties, and there,"
1|thought he, "I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there,
1|standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of
1|me."
1|
1|He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.
1|Seeing them he kept thinking, "That may be the very standard with
1|which I shall lead the army."
1|
1|In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights
1|was a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay
1|like a milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left
1|into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of
1|firing. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the
1|vast orb of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that
1|sea of mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there
1|the enemy probably was, for something could be descried. On the
1|right the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of
1|hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the left
1|beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared
1|in the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The
1|commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting
1|the troops pass by him. That morning Kutuzov seemed worn and
1|irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt without
1|any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in front.
1|
1|"Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the
1|village!" he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. "Don't you
1|understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile
1|through narrow village streets when we are marching against the
1|enemy?"
1|
1|"I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,"
1|answered the general.
1|
1|Kutuzov laughed bitterly.
1|
1|"You'll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!
1|Very fine!"
1|
1|"The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the
1|dispositions..."
1|
1|"The dispositions!" exclaimed Kutuzov bitterly. "Who told you
1|that?... Kindly do as you are ordered."
1|
1|"Yes, sir."
1|
1|"My dear fellow," Nesvitski whispered to Prince Andrew, "the old man
1|is as surly as a dog."
1|
1|An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his
1|hat galloped up to Kutuzov and asked in the Emperor's name had the
1|fourth column advanced into action.
1|
1|Kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to
1|fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutuzov's
1|malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that
1|what was being done was not his adjutant's fault, and still not
1|answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski.
1|
1|"Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed
1|the village. Tell it to stop and await my orders."
1|
1|Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.
1|
1|"And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted," he added. "What
1|are they doing? What are they doing?" he murmured to himself, still
1|not replying to the Austrian.
1|
1|Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
1|
1|Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped
1|the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
1|sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of
1|the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief's order to
1|throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were
1|other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six
1|miles away. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a
1|barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the
1|commander in chief's name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew
1|galloped back. Kutuzov still in the same place, his stout body resting
1|heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily
1|with closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood with the
1|butts of their muskets on the ground.
1|
1|"All right, all right!" he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a
1|general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all
1|the left-flank columns had already descended.
1|
1|"Plenty of time, your excellency," muttered Kutuzov in the midst
1|of a yawn. "Plenty of time," he repeated.
1|
1|Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound of
1|regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole
1|extended line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person
1|they were greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the
1|regiment in front of which Kutuzov was standing began to shout, he
1|rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. Along the
1|road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen
1|in various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side in front, at full
1|gallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a
1|bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode
1|a black one. These were the two Emperors followed by their suites.
1|Kutuzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave
1|the command "Attention!" and rode up to the Emperors with a salute.
1|His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on
1|the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an
1|affectation of respect which evidently struck Alexander
1|unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.
1|
1|This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy
1|face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and
1|vanished. After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than
1|on the field of Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for the first time
1|abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty
1|and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the
1|same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance
1|of goodhearted innocent youth.
1|
1|At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed
1|brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping
1|two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked
1|round at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own.
1|Czartoryski, Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, and the others,
1|all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh,
1|only slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had
1|stopped behind the Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced
1|young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about
1|him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his
1|white adjutants and asked some question--"Most likely he is asking
1|at what o'clock they started," thought Prince Andrew, watching his old
1|acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his
1|reception at Brunn. In the Emperors' suite were the picked young
1|orderly officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and
1|Austrian. Among them were grooms leading the Tsar's beautiful relay
1|horses covered with embroidered cloths.
1|
1|As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields
1|enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and
1|confidence of success reached Kutuzov's cheerless staff with the
1|galloping advent of all these brilliant young men.
1|
1|"Why aren't you beginning, Michael Ilarionovich?" said the Emperor
1|Alexander hurriedly to Kutuzov, glancing courteously at the same
1|time at the Emperor Francis.
1|
1|"I am waiting, Your Majesty," answered Kutuzov, bending forward
1|respectfully.
1|
1|The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had
1|not quite heard.
1|
1|"Waiting, Your Majesty," repeated Kutuzov. (Prince Andrew noted that
1|Kutuzov's upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word
1|"waiting.") "Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty."
1|
1|The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his
1|rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was near him, as
1|if complaining of Kutuzov.
1|
1|"You know, Michael Ilarionovich, we are not on the
1|Empress' Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are
1|assembled," said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor
1|Francis, as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to
1|what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis continued to look about
1|him and did not listen.
1|
1|"That is just why I do not begin, sire," said Kutuzov in a
1|resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not
1|being heard, and again something in his face twitched--"That is just
1|why I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on
1|the Empress' Field," said clearly and distinctly.
1|
1|In the Emperor's suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
1|dissatisfaction and reproach. "Old though he may be, he should not, he
1|certainly should not, speak like that," their glances seemed to say.
1|
1|The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutuzov's eye
1|waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutuzov,
1|with respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence
1|lasted for about a minute.
1|
1|"However, if you command it, Your Majesty," said Kutuzov, lifting
1|his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning,
1|but submissive general.
1|
1|He touched his horse and having called Miloradovich, the commander
1|of the column, gave him the order to advance.
1|
1|The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Novgorod
1|and one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.
1|
1|As this Apsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Miloradovich,
1|without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous
1|tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners
1|front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing
1|salute reined in his horse before the Emperor.
1|
1|"God be with you, general!" said the Emperor.
1|
1|"Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite,
1|sire,"* he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among
1|the gentlemen of the Tsar's suite by his poor French.
1|
1|
1|*"Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to do, Sire."
1|
1|
1|Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a
1|little behind the Emperor. The Apsheron men, excited by the Tsar's
1|presence, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a
1|bold, brisk pace.
1|
1|"Lads!" shouted Miloradovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery
1|voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect
1|of battle, and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons, his comrades
1|in Suvorov's time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors,
1|that he forgot the sovereigns' presence. "Lads, it's not the first
1|village you've had to take," cried he.
1|
1|"Glad to do our best!" shouted the soldiers.
1|
1|The Emperor's horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had
1|carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the
1|field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot
1|and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
1|Empress' Field, not understanding the significance of the firing,
1|nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis' black cob, nor of all that
1|was being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.
1|
1|The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
1|remark to him, pointing to the gallant Apsherons.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind
1|the carabineers.
1|
1|When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column
1|he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been
1|an inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops
1|were marching along both.
1|
1|The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly
1|visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down
1|below, on the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutuzov had
1|stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who
1|was a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask
1|him for a field glass.
1|
1|"Look, look!" said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the
1|distance, but down the hill before him. "It's the French!"
1|
1|The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass,
1|trying to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their
1|faces suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to
1|be a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly
1|appeared just in front of us.
1|
1|"It's the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But
1|how is that?" said different voices.
1|
1|With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not
1|more than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing, a
1|dense French column coming up to meet the Apsherons.
1|
1|"Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,"
1|thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutuzov.
1|
1|"The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency," cried he. But at
1|that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was
1|heard quite close at hand, and a voice of naive terror barely two
1|steps from Prince Andrew shouted, "Brothers! All's lost!" And at
1|this as if at a command, everyone began to run.
1|
1|Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where
1|five minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would
1|it have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible
1|not to be carried back with it oneself. Bolkonski only tried not to
1|lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp
1|what was happening in front of him. Nesvitski with an angry face,
1|red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did not
1|ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutuzov
1|remained in the same place and without answering drew out a
1|handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced
1|his way to him.
1|
1|"You are wounded?" he asked, hardly able to master the trembling
1|of his lower jaw.
1|
1|"The wound is not here, it is there!" said Kutuzov, pressing the
1|handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing
1|soldiers. "Stop them!" he shouted, and at the same moment, probably
1|realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and
1|rode to the right.
1|
1|A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.
1|
1|The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
1|them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, "Get on! Why
1|are you hindering us?" Another in the same place turned round and
1|fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutuzov himself rode.
1|Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of
1|men, Kutuzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward
1|a sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the
1|crowd of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzov, saw on
1|the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was
1|still firing and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some
1|Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery nor
1|backward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself
1|from the infantry and approached Kutuzov. Of Kutuzov's suite only four
1|remained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.
1|
1|"Stop those wretches!" gasped Kutuzov to the regimental commander,
1|pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to
1|punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment
1|and across Kutuzov's suite like a flock of little birds.
1|
1|The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were firing
1|at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his
1|leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding
1|the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on
1|the muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing
1|without orders.
1|
1|"Oh! Oh! Oh!" groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked around....
1|"Bolkonski!" he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of
1|the feebleness of age, "Bolkonski!" he whispered, pointing to the
1|disordered battalion and at the enemy, "what's that?"
1|
1|But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of
1|shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and
1|run to the standard.
1|
1|"Forward, lads!" he shouted in a voice piercing as a child's.
1|
1|"Here it is!" thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and
1|hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.
1|Several soldiers fell.
1|
1|"Hurrah!" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the
1|heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole
1|battalion would follow him.
1|
1|And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then
1|another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting "Hurrah!"
1|and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag
1|that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew's hands, but he
1|was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,
1|dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw
1|our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having
1|abandoned their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French
1|infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning
1|the guns round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within
1|twenty paces of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above
1|him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually
1|groaned and dropped. But he did not look at them: he looked only at
1|what was going on in front of him--at the battery. He now saw
1|clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry,
1|pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other.
1|He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the
1|faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they were
1|doing.
1|
1|"What are they about?" thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.
1|"Why doesn't the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why
1|doesn't the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the
1|Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him...."
1|
1|And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to
1|the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had
1|triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited
1|him, was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it
1|ended. It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him
1|on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but
1|the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his
1|seeing what he had been looking at.
1|
1|"What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way," thought he, and
1|fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle
1|of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner
1|had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or
1|saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the
1|sky--the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with
1|gray clouds gliding slowly across it. "How quiet, peaceful, and
1|solemn; not at all as I ran," thought Prince Andrew--"not as we ran,
1|shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with
1|frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do
1|those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did
1|not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it
1|at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite
1|sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even it does not

1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|On our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o'clock the
1|battle had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov's
1|demand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility
1|from himself, Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgorukov to send to
1|inquire of the commander in chief. Bagration knew that as the distance
1|between the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the
1|messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), and found
1|the commander in chief (which would be very difficult), he would not
1|be able to get back before evening.
1|
1|Bagration cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his
1|suite, and the boyish face Rostov, breathless with excitement and
1|hope, was the first to catch his eye. He sent him.
1|
1|"And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in
1|chief, your excellency?" said Rostov, with his hand to his cap.
1|
1|"You can give the message to His Majesty," said Dolgorukov,
1|hurriedly interrupting Bagration.
1|
1|On being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few
1|hours' sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute,
1|with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and
1|generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem
1|possible, pleasant, and easy.
1|
1|All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be
1|a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he
1|was orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going
1|with a message to Kutuzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself.
1|The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart
1|was full of joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his
1|horse the rein and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the
1|line of Bagration's troops, which had not yet advanced into action but
1|were standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by
1|Uvarov's cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation
1|for battle; having passed Uvarov's cavalry he clearly heard the
1|sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder
1|and louder.
1|
1|In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket
1|shots at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two
1|cannon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the
1|hill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon
1|that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but
1|merged into a general roar.
1|
1|He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one
1|another down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling,
1|spreading, and mingling with one another. He could also, by the
1|gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of
1|infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons.
1|
1|Rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was
1|going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand
1|or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men
1|of some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of
1|troops; but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make
1|out. These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating
1|effect on him; on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and
1|determination.
1|
1|"Go on! Go on! Give it them!" he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,
1|and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther
1|and farther into the region where the army was already in action.
1|
1|"How it will be there I don't know, but all will be well!" thought
1|Rostov.
1|
1|After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part
1|of the line (the Guards) was already in action.
1|
1|"So much the better! I shall see it close," he thought.
1|
1|He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came
1|galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks
1|were returning from the attack. Rostov got out of their way,
1|involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.
1|
1|"That is no business of mine," he thought. He had not ridden many
1|hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole
1|width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
1|uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and
1|across his path. Rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
1|way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at
1|the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of
1|the horses were already galloping. Rostov heard the thud of their
1|hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their
1|figures, and even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our
1|Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming
1|to meet them.
1|
1|The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their
1|horses. Rostov could already see their faces and heard the command:
1|"Charge!" shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to
1|full speed. Rostov, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack
1|on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go,
1|but still was not in time to avoid them.
1|
1|The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned
1|angrily on seeing Rostov before him, with whom he would inevitably
1|collide. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostov and his
1|Bedouin over (Rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to
1|these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rostov to
1|flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman's horse. The
1|heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its
1|ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in
1|violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its neck,
1|galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostov
1|before he heard them shout, "Hurrah!" and looking back saw that
1|their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with
1|red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing more, for
1|immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
1|enveloped everything.
1|
1|At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him,
1|disappeared in the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after
1|them or to go where he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of
1|the Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves. Rostov was
1|horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome
1|men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had
1|galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were
1|left after the charge.
1|
1|"Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall
1|see the Emperor immediately!" thought Rostov and galloped on.
1|
1|When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them
1|and around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so
1|much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on
1|the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
1|officers.
1|
1|Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he
1|heard a voice calling him by name.
1|
1|"Rostov!"
1|
1|"What?" he answered, not recognizing Boris.
1|
1|"I say, we've been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!" said
1|Boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have
1|been under fire for the first time.
1|
1|Rostov stopped.
1|
1|"Have you?" he said. "Well, how did it go?"
1|
1|"We drove them back!" said Boris with animation, growing
1|talkative. "Can you imagine it?" and he began describing how the
1|Guards, having taken up their position and seeing troops before
1|them, thought they were Austrians, and all at once discovered from the
1|cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in
1|the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action. Rostov
1|without hearing Boris to the end spurred his horse.
1|
1|"Where are you off to?" asked Boris.
1|
1|"With a message to His Majesty."
1|
1|"There he is!" said Boris, thinking Rostov had said "His
1|Highness," and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high
1|shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in
1|his helmet and Horse Guards' jacket, shouting something to a pale,
1|white uniformed Austrian officer.
1|
1|"But that's the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the
1|Emperor," said Rostov, and was about to spur his horse.
1|
1|"Count! Count!" shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager
1|as Boris. "Count! I am wounded in my right hand" (and he showed his
1|bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) "and I remained at
1|the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family--the
1|von Bergs--have been knights!"
1|
1|He said something more, but Rostov did not wait to hear it and
1|rode away.
1|
1|Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostov, to
1|avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the
1|Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round
1|the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard.
1|Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind
1|our troops, where he could never have expected the enemy to be.
1|
1|"What can it be?" he thought. "The enemy in the rear of our army?
1|Impossible!" And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
1|and for the issue of the whole battle. "But be that what it may," he
1|reflected, "there is no riding round it now. I must look for the
1|commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish
1|with the rest."
1|
1|The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostov was more
1|and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the
1|village of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.
1|
1|"What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is
1|firing?" Rostov kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian
1|soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.
1|
1|"The devil knows! They've killed everybody! It's all up now!" he was
1|told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who
1|understood what was happening as little as he did.
1|
1|"Kill the Germans!" shouted one.
1|
1|"May the devil take them--the traitors!"
1|
1|"Zum Henker diese Russen!"* muttered a German.
1|
1|
1|*"Hang these Russians!"
1|
1|
1|Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse,
1|screams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing
1|died down. Rostov learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had
1|been firing at one another.
1|
1|"My God! What does it all mean?" thought he. "And here, where at any
1|moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a
1|handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can't be that, it
1|can't be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!"
1|
1|The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov's head.
1|Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights
1|just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief,
1|he could not, did not wish to, believe that.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|Rostov had been ordered to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor near the
1|village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer
1|were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He
1|urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but
1|the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on
1|which he had come out was thronged with caleches, carriages of all
1|sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and
1|some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
1|dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries
1|stationed on the Pratzen Heights.
1|
1|"Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutuzov?" Rostov kept asking
1|everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.
1|
1|At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.
1|
1|"Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!" said the soldier,
1|laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.
1|
1|Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostov stopped the
1|horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
1|question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a
1|carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
1|that he was dangerously wounded.
1|
1|"It can't be!" said Rostov. "It must have been someone else."
1|
1|"I saw him myself," replied the man with a self-confident smile of
1|derision. "I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I've
1|seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat
1|in the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black
1|horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It's time I knew the
1|Imperial horses and Ilya Ivanych. I don't think Ilya drives anyone
1|except the Tsar!"
1|
1|Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a
1|wounded officer passing by addressed him:
1|
1|"Who is it you want?" he asked. "The commander in chief? He was
1|killed by a cannon ball--struck in the breast before our regiment."
1|
1|"Not killed--wounded!" another officer corrected him.
1|
1|"Who? Kutuzov?" asked Rostov.
1|
1|"Not Kutuzov, but what's his name--well, never mind... there are not
1|many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders
1|are there," said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,
1|and he walked on.
1|
1|Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
1|going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible
1|to doubt it now. Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him, in
1|which he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now
1|to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov, even if they were alive and
1|unwounded?
1|
1|"Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!" a
1|soldier shouted to him. "They'd kill you there!"
1|
1|"Oh, what are you talking about?" said another. "Where is he to
1|go? That way is nearer."
1|
1|Rostov considered, and then went in the direction where they said he
1|would be killed.
1|
1|"It's all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to
1|save myself?" he thought. He rode on to the region where the
1|greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The
1|French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russians--the
1|uninjured and slightly wounded--had left it long ago. All about the
1|field, like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to
1|fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. The wounded crept
1|together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing
1|screams and groans, sometimes feigned--or so it seemed to Rostov. He
1|put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and
1|he felt afraid--afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed
1|and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates.
1|
1|The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
1|wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an
1|adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several
1|shots. The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the
1|corpses around him merged in Rostov's mind into a single feeling of
1|terror and pity for himself. He remembered his mother's last letter.
1|"What would she feel," thought he, "if she saw me here now on this
1|field with the cannon aimed at me?"
1|
1|In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from
1|the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less
1|disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry
1|fire sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the
1|battle was lost. No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the
1|Emperor or Kutuzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was
1|wounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false
1|rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor's carriage had
1|really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified
1|Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the
1|battlefield with others in the Emperor's suite. One officer told
1|Rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village
1|to the left, and thither Rostov rode, not hoping to find anyone but
1|merely to ease his conscience. When he had ridden about two miles
1|and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a
1|kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing
1|the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to
1|Rostov; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rostov
1|fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse
1|with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a
1|little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse's hind hoofs.
1|Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and
1|deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes,
1|evidently suggesting that he should do the same. The rider, whose
1|figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted his
1|attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by
1|that gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored
1|monarch.
1|
1|"But it can't be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!"
1|thought Rostov. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostov
1|saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory.
1|The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the
1|charm, the mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostov was
1|happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded
1|were false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and
1|even ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgorukov had
1|ordered him to deliver.
1|
1|But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter
1|the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help
1|or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and
1|he is alone with her, so Rostov, now that he had attained what he
1|had longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know
1|how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him
1|why it would be inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.
1|
1|"What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of
1|his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant
1|or painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to
1|him now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere
1|sight of him?" Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the
1|Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall.
1|Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for
1|the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph,
1|generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked
1|him for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his
1|actions had proved.
1|
1|"Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the
1|right flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost?
1|No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his
1|reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
1|look or bad opinion from him," Rostov decided; and sorrowfully and
1|with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at
1|the Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.
1|
1|While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,
1|Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the
1|Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him
1|to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling
1|unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.
1|Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke
1|long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,
1|covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll's hand.
1|
1|"And I might have been in his place!" thought Rostov, and hardly
1|restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter
1|despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.
1|
1|His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness
1|was the cause of his grief.
1|
1|He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the
1|sovereign. It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the
1|Emperor and he had not made use of it.... "What have I done?"
1|thought he. And he turned round and galloped back to the place where
1|he had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now.
1|Only some carts and carriages were passing by. From one of the drivers
1|he learned that Kutuzov's staff were not far off, in the village the
1|vehicles were going to. Rostov followed them. In front of him walked
1|Kutuzov's groom leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and
1|behind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked
1|cap and sheepskin coat.
1|
1|"Tit! I say, Tit!" said the groom.
1|
1|"What?" answered the old man absent-mindedly.
1|
1|"Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!"
1|
1|"Oh, you fool!" said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed
1|in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.
1|
1|
1|Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points.
1|More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.
1|
1|Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other
1|columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly
1|confused masses.
1|
1|The remains of Langeron's and Dokhturov's mingled forces were
1|crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of
1|Augesd.
1|
1|After five o'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot
1|cannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from
1|numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights,
1|directed at our retreating forces.
1|
1|In the rearguard, Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept
1|up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops.
1|It was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many
1|years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap
1|peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled
1|up, handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on
1|that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and
1|blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with
1|wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts--on that
1|narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses' hoofs and
1|between the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now
1|crowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying
1|and killing one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed
1|themselves in the same way.
1|
1|Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around,
1|or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and
1|splashing with blood those near them.
1|
1|Dolokhov--now an officer--wounded in the arm, and on foot, with
1|the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,
1|represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by
1|the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and,
1|jammed in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had
1|fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon
1|ball killed someone behind them, another fell in front and splashed
1|Dolokhov with blood. The crowd, pushing forward desperately,
1|squeezed together, moved a few steps, and again stopped.
1|
1|"Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here
1|another two minutes and it is certain death," thought each one.
1|
1|Dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the
1|edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto
1|the slippery ice that covered the millpool.
1|
1|"Turn this way!" he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked
1|under him; "turn this way!" he shouted to those with the gun. "It
1|bears!..."
1|
1|The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it
1|would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon
1|even under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to
1|the bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at
1|the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to
1|address Dolokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd
1|that everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general
1|fell from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or
1|thought of raising him.
1|
1|"Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don't you hear? Go
1|on!" innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the
1|general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were
1|shouting.
1|
1|One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto
1|the ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen
1|pond. The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg
1|slipped into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to
1|his waist. The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped
1|his horse, but from behind still came the shouts: "Onto the ice, why
1|do you stop? Go on! Go on!" And cries of horror were heard in the
1|crowd. The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the
1|horses to make them turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank.
1|The ice, that had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass,
1|and some forty men who were on it dashed, some forward and some
1|back, drowning one another.
1|
1|Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop
1|onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd

1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in
1|his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and
1|unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.
1|
1|Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did
1|not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt
1|that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his
1|head.
1|
1|"Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw
1|today?" was his first thought. "And I did not know this suffering
1|either," he thought. "Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all
1|till now. But where am I?"
1|
1|He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices
1|speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same
1|lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher,
1|and between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and
1|did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had
1|ridden up and stopped near him.
1|
1|It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding
1|over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the
1|batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and
1|wounded left on the field.
1|
1|"Fine men!" remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian
1|grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened
1|nape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.
1|
1|"The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your
1|Majesty," said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were
1|firing at Augesd.
1|
1|"Have some brought from the reserve," said Napoleon, and having gone
1|on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back
1|with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had
1|already been taken by the French as a trophy.)
1|
1|"That's a fine death!" said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski.
1|
1|Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
1|Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he
1|heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not
1|only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at
1|once forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to
1|death, and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He
1|knew it was Napoleon--his hero--but at that moment Napoleon seemed
1|to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was
1|passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the
1|clouds flying over it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who
1|might be standing over him, or what was said of him; he was only
1|glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they
1|would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so
1|beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so
1|differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound.
1|He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused
1|his own pity.
1|
1|"Ah! He is alive," said Napoleon. "Lift this young man up and
1|carry him to the dressing station."
1|
1|Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who,
1|hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the
1|victory.
1|
1|Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from
1|the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting
1|while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing
1|station. He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when
1|with other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the
1|hospital. During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was
1|able to look about him and even speak.
1|
1|The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a
1|French convoy officer, who said rapidly: "We must halt here: the
1|Emperor will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these
1|gentlemen prisoners."
1|
1|"There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,
1|that he is probably tired of them," said another officer.
1|
1|"All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
1|Alexander's Guards," said the first one, indicating a Russian
1|officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.
1|
1|Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg
1|society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of
1|the Horse Guards.
1|
1|Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.
1|
1|"Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.
1|
1|They named the colonel, Prince Repnin.
1|
1|"You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander's regiment of
1|Horse Guards?" asked Napoleon.
1|
1|"I commanded a squadron," replied Repnin.
1|
1|"Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably," said Napoleon.
1|
1|"The praise of a great commander is a soldier's highest reward,"
1|said Repnin.
1|
1|"I bestow it with pleasure," said Napoleon. "And who is that young
1|man beside you?"
1|
1|Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.
1|
1|After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
1|
1|"He's very young to come to meddle with us."
1|
1|"Youth is no hindrance to courage," muttered Sukhtelen in a
1|failing voice.
1|
1|"A splendid reply!" said Napoleon. "Young man, you will go far!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the
1|Emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to
1|attract his attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on
1|the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet "young
1|man" that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Well, and you, young man," said he. "How do you feel, mon brave?"
1|
1|Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few
1|words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed
1|straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that
1|moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so
1|mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory
1|appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he
1|had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.
1|
1|Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
1|stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,
1|suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into
1|Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
1|greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and
1|the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one
1|alive could understand or explain.
1|
1|The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to
1|one of the officers as he went: "Have these gentlemen attended to
1|and taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their
1|wounds. Au revoir, Prince Repnin!" and he spurred his horse and
1|galloped away.
1|
1|His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.
1|
1|The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the
1|little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck,
1|but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now
1|hastened to return the holy image.
1|
1|Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the
1|little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his
1|chest outside his uniform.
1|
1|"It would be good," thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his
1|sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, "it
1|would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
1|Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,
1|and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I
1|should be if I could now say: 'Lord, have mercy on me!'... But to whom
1|should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,
1|which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
1|words--the Great All or Nothing-" said he to himself, "or to that God
1|who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain,
1|nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and
1|the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important."
1|
1|The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable
1|pain; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his
1|father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt
1|the night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little
1|Napoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief
1|subjects of his delirious fancies.
1|
1|The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented
1|itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that little
1|Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
1|shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and
1|torments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward
1|morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness
1|of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon's
1|doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in
1|convalescence.
1|
1|"He is a nervous, bilious subject," said Larrey, "and will not
1|recover."
1|
1|And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care
1|of the inhabitants of the district.

1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostov returned home on leave.
1|Denisov was going home to Voronezh and Rostov persuaded him to
1|travel with him as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a
1|comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow, Denisov had
1|drunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts
1|across the snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to
1|Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostov, who grew
1|more and more impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.
1|
1|"How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,
1|shops, bakers' signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!" thought Rostov,
1|when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had
1|entered Moscow.
1|
1|"Denisov! We're here! He's asleep," he added, leaning forward with
1|his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed
1|of the sleigh.
1|
1|Denisov gave no answer.
1|
1|"There's the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakhar, has
1|his stand, and there's Zakhar himself and still the same horse! And
1|here's the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can't you
1|hurry up? Now then!"
1|
1|"Which house is it?" asked the driver.
1|
1|"Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don't you see? That's
1|our house," said Rostov. "Of course, it's our house! Denisov, Denisov!
1|We're almost there!"
1|
1|Denisov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.
1|
1|"Dmitri," said Rostov to his valet on the box, "those lights are
1|in our house, aren't they?"
1|
1|"Yes, sir, and there's a light in your father's study."
1|
1|"Then they've not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,
1|don't forget to put out my new coat," added Rostov, fingering his
1|new mustache. "Now then, get on," he shouted to the driver. "Do wake
1|up, Vaska!" he went on, turning to Denisov, whose head was again
1|nodding. "Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodka--get
1|on!" Rostov shouted, when the sleigh was only three houses from his
1|door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all. At last
1|the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostov saw
1|overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off,
1|the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He sprang out
1|before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house stood cold
1|and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it. There was no
1|one in the hall. "Oh God! Is everyone all right?" he thought, stopping
1|for a moment with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to
1|run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar
1|staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always angered the
1|countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely as
1|ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.
1|
1|Old Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokofy, the footman, who was
1|so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat
1|plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the
1|opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly
1|changed to one of delighted amazement.
1|
1|"Gracious heavens! The young count!" he cried, recognizing his young
1|master. "Can it be? My treasure!" and Prokofy, trembling with
1|excitement, rushed toward the drawing-room door, probably in order
1|to announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss
1|the young man's shoulder.
1|
1|"All well?" asked Rostov, drawing away his arm.
1|
1|"Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They've just finished supper. Let me have
1|a look at you, your excellency."
1|
1|"Is everything quite all right?"
1|
1|"The Lord be thanked, yes!"
1|
1|Rostov, who had completely forgotten Denisov, not wishing anyone
1|to forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
1|large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card
1|tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had
1|already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the
1|drawing room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and
1|began hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the
1|same kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more
1|kissing, more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish
1|which was Papa, which Natasha, and which Petya. Everyone shouted,
1|talked, and kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not
1|there, he noticed that.
1|
1|"And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!..."
1|
1|"Here he is... our own... Kolya,* dear fellow... How he has
1|changed!... Where are the candles?... Tea!..."
1|
1|
1|*Nicholas.
1|
1|
1|"And me, kiss me!"
1|
1|"Dearest... and me!"
1|
1|Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhaylovna, Vera, and the old count
1|were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the
1|room, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.
1|
1|Petya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, "And me too!"
1|
1|Natasha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his
1|face with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang
1|away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked
1|piercingly.
1|
1|All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all
1|around were lips seeking a kiss.
1|
1|Sonya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,
1|looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she
1|longed. Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at
1|this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not
1|taking her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave
1|her a grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for
1|someone. The old countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard
1|at the door, steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's.
1|
1|Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made
1|since he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her.
1|When they met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her
1|face, but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar's jacket.
1|Denisov, who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there
1|and wiped his eyes at the sight.
1|
1|"Vasili Denisov, your son's friend," he said, introducing himself to
1|the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.
1|
1|"You are most welcome! I know, I know," said the count, kissing
1|and embracing Denisov. "Nicholas wrote us... Natasha, Vera, look! Here
1|is Denisov!"
1|
1|The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of
1|Denisov.
1|
1|"Darling Denisov!" screamed Natasha, beside herself with rapture,
1|springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This
1|escapade made everybody feel confused. Denisov blushed too, but smiled
1|and, taking Natasha's hand, kissed it.
1|
1|Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostovs
1|all gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.
1|
1|The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
1|moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every
1|movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully
1|adoring eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places
1|nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him
1|his tea, handkerchief, and pipe.
1|
1|Rostov was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first
1|moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
1|insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.
1|
1|Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers
1|slept till ten o'clock.
1|
1|In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,
1|satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly
1|cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The
1|servants were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving,
1|and their well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell
1|of tobacco.
1|
1|"Hallo, Gwiska--my pipe!" came Vasili Denisov's husky voice.
1|"Wostov, get up!"
1|
1|Rostov, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his
1|disheveled head from the hot pillow.
1|
1|"Why, is it late?"
1|
1|"Late! It's nearly ten o'clock," answered Natasha's voice. A
1|rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of
1|girls' voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a
1|crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black
1|hair, and merry faces. It was Natasha, Sonya, and Petya, who had
1|come to see whether they were getting up.
1|
1|"Nicholas! Get up!" Natasha's voice was again heard at the door.
1|
1|"Directly!"
1|
1|Meanwhile, Petya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer
1|room, with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder
1|brother, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see
1|men undressed, opened the bedroom door.
1|
1|"Is this your saber?" he shouted.
1|
1|The girls sprang aside. Denisov hid his hairy legs under the
1|blanket, looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door,
1|having let Petya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from
1|behind it.
1|
1|"Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!" said Natasha's voice.
1|
1|"Is this your saber?" asked Petya. "Or is it yours?" he said,
1|addressing the black-mustached Denisov with servile deference.
1|
1|Rostov hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing
1|gown, and went out. Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just
1|getting her foot into the other. Sonya, when he came in, was
1|twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon
1|and sit down. They were dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and
1|were both fresh, rosy, and bright. Sonya ran away, but Natasha, taking
1|her brother's arm, led him into the sitting room, where they began
1|talking. They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give
1|replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not
1|interest anyone but themselves. Natasha laughed at every word he
1|said or that she said herself, not because what they were saying was
1|amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable to control her
1|joy which expressed itself by laughter.
1|
1|"Oh, how nice, how splendid!" she said to everything.
1|
1|Rostov felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that
1|childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he
1|left home now for the first time after eighteen months again
1|brightened his soul and his face.
1|
1|"No, but listen," she said, "now you are quite a man, aren't you?
1|I'm awfully glad you're my brother." She touched his mustache. "I want
1|to know what you men are like. Are you the same as we? No?"
1|
1|"Why did Sonya run away?" asked Rostov.
1|
1|"Ah, yes! That's a whole long story! How are you going to speak to
1|her--thou or you?"
1|
1|"As may happen," said Rostov.
1|
1|"No, call her you, please! I'll tell you all about it some other
1|time. No, I'll tell you now. You know Sonya's my dearest friend.
1|Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!"
1|
1|She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her
1|long, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is
1|covered even by a ball dress.
1|
1|"I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in
1|the fire and pressed it there!"
1|
1|Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what
1|used to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natasha's wildly
1|bright eyes, Rostov re-entered that world of home and childhood
1|which had no meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best
1|joys of his life; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of
1|love did not seem to him senseless, he understood and was not
1|surprised at it.
1|
1|"Well, and is that all?" he asked.
1|
1|"We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just
1|nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does
1|it for life, but I don't understand that, I forget quickly."
1|
1|"Well, what then?"
1|
1|"Well, she loves me and you like that."
1|
1|Natasha suddenly flushed.
1|
1|"Why, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are
1|to forget all that.... She says: 'I shall love him always, but let him
1|be free.' Isn't that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn't it?"
1|asked Natasha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that
1|what she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.
1|
1|Rostov became thoughtful.
1|
1|"I never go back on my word," he said. "Besides, Sonya is so
1|charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness."
1|
1|"No, no!" cried Natasha, "she and I have already talked it over.
1|We knew you'd say so. But it won't do, because you see, if you say
1|that--if you consider yourself bound by your promise--it will seem
1|as if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were
1|marrying her because you must, and that wouldn't do at all."
1|
1|Rostov saw that it had been well considered by them. Sonya had
1|already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when
1|he had caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She
1|was a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with
1|him (he did not doubt that for an instant). Why should he not love her
1|now, and even marry her, Rostov thought, but just now there were so
1|many other pleasures and interests before him! "Yes, they have taken a
1|wise decision," he thought, "I must remain free."
1|
1|"Well then, that's excellent," said he. "We'll talk it over later
1|on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!"
1|
1|"Well, and are you still true to Boris?" he continued.
1|
1|"Oh, what nonsense!" cried Natasha, laughing. "I don't think about
1|him or anyone else, and I don't want anything of the kind."
1|
1|"Dear me! Then what are you up to now?"
1|
1|"Now?" repeated Natasha, and a happy smile lit up her face. "Have
1|you seen Duport?"
1|
1|"No."
1|
1|"Not seen Duport--the famous dancer? Well then, you won't
1|understand. That's what I'm up to."
1|
1|Curving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran
1|back a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply
1|together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.
1|
1|"See, I'm standing! See!" she said, but could not maintain herself
1|on her toes any longer. "So that's what I'm up to! I'll never marry
1|anyone, but will be a dancer. Only don't tell anyone."
1|
1|Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov, in his bedroom,
1|felt envious and Natasha could not help joining in.
1|
1|"No, but don't you think it's nice?" she kept repeating.
1|
1|"Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Boris?"
1|
1|Natasha flared up. "I don't want to marry anyone. And I'll tell
1|him so when I see him!"
1|
1|"Dear me!" said Rostov.
1|
1|"But that's all rubbish," Natasha chattered on. "And is Denisov
1|nice?" she asked.
1|
1|"Yes, indeed!"
1|
1|"Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible,
1|Denisov?"
1|
1|"Why terrible?" asked Nicholas. "No, Vaska is a splendid fellow."
1|
1|"You call him Vaska? That's funny! And is he very nice?"
1|
1|"Very."
1|
1|"Well then, be quick. We'll all have breakfast together."
1|
1|And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet
1|dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When
1|Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know how
1|to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of
1|meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not
1|be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was
1|looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave
1|with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as
1|you--Sonya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender
1|kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by
1|Natasha's intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then thanked
1|him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom
1|and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her,
1|for that would be impossible.
1|
1|"How strange it is," said Vera, selecting a moment when all were
1|silent, "that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet
1|like strangers."
1|
1|Vera's remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most
1|of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only
1|Sonya, Nicholas, and Natasha, but even the old countess, who--dreading
1|this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant
1|match--blushed like a girl.
1|
1|Denisov, to Rostov's surprise, appeared in the drawing room with
1|pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as
1|he made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the
1|ladies and gentlemen than Rostov had ever expected to see him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostov was
1|welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their
1|darling Nikolenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and
1|polite young man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of
1|hussars, a good dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.
1|
1|The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough
1|that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,
1|acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the
1|latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
1|latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,
1|passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself
1|to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be
1|at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His
1|despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money
1|from Gavril to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing Sonya on the sly--he
1|now recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.
1|Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and
1|wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in
1|action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected
1|racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a
1|lady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led
1|the mazurka at the Arkharovs' ball, talked about the war with Field
1|Marshal Kamenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate
1|terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denisov had introduced him.
1|
1|His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But
1|still, as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him,
1|he often spoke about him and about his love for him, letting it be
1|understood that he had not told all and that there was something in
1|his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand, and with
1|his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in Moscow for the
1|Emperor, who was spoken of as the "angel incarnate."
1|
1|During Rostov's short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army,
1|he did not draw closer to Sonya, but rather drifted away from her. She
1|was very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him,
1|but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do
1|that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears
1|to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many
1|other things. When he thought of Sonya, during this stay in Moscow, he
1|said to himself, "Ah, there will be, and there are, many more such
1|girls somewhere whom I do not yet know. There will be time enough to
1|think about love when I want to, but now I have no time." Besides,
1|it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to
1|his manhood. He went to balls and into ladies' society with an
1|affectation of doing so against his will. The races, the English Club,
1|sprees with Denisov, and visits to a certain house--that was another
1|matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!
1|
1|At the beginning of March, old Count Ilya Rostov was very busy
1|arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club.
1|
1|The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving
1|orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist, the Club's head
1|cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish
1|for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee of
1|the Club from the day it was founded. To him the Club entrusted the
1|arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration, for few men knew so
1|well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and
1|still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
1|their own resources what might be needed for the success of the
1|fete. The club cook and the steward listened to the count's orders
1|with pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could
1|they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner
1|costing several thousand rubles.
1|
1|"Well then, mind and have cocks' comb in the turtle soup, you know!"
1|
1|"Shall we have three cold dishes then?" asked the cook.
1|
1|The count considered.
1|
1|"We can't have less--yes, three... the mayonnaise, that's one," said
1|he, bending down a finger.
1|
1|"Then am I to order those large sterlets?" asked the steward.
1|
1|"Yes, it can't be helped if they won't take less. Ah, dear me! I was
1|forgetting. We must have another entree. Ah, goodness gracious!" he
1|clutched at his head. "Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmitri! Eh,
1|Dmitri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate," he said to the factotum
1|who appeared at his call. "Hurry off and tell Maksim, the gardener, to
1|set the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must
1|be brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred
1|pots here on Friday."
1|
1|Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his
1|"little countess" to have a rest, but remembering something else of
1|importance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club
1|steward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the
1|clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count,
1|handsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made
1|sleeker by his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.
1|
1|"Ah, my boy, my head's in a whirl!" said the old man with a smile,
1|as if he felt a little confused before his son. "Now, if you would
1|only help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own
1|orchestra, but shouldn't we get the gypsy singers as well? You
1|military men like that sort of thing."
1|
1|"Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagration worried himself less
1|before the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now," said his son with
1|a smile.
1|
1|The old count pretended to be angry.
1|
1|"Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!"
1|
1|And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and
1|respectful expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the
1|father and son.
1|
1|"What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktist?" said
1|he. "Laughing at us old fellows!"
1|
1|"That's so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good
1|dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that's not their
1|business!"
1|
1|"That's it, that's it!" exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his
1|son by both hands, he cried, "Now I've got you, so take the sleigh and
1|pair at once, and go to Bezukhov's, and tell him 'Count Ilya has
1|sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.' We can't get
1|them from anyone else. He's not there himself, so you'll have to go in
1|and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay--the
1|coachman Ipatka knows--and look up the gypsy Ilyushka, the one who
1|danced at Count Orlov's, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and
1|bring him along to me."
1|
1|"And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?" asked
1|Nicholas, laughing. "Dear, dear!..."
1|
1|At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the
1|businesslike, preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never
1|left her face, Anna Mikhaylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon
1|the count in his dressing gown every day, he invariably became
1|confused and begged her to excuse his costume.
1|
1|"No matter at all, my dear count," she said, meekly closing her
1|eyes. "But I'll go to Bezukhov's myself. Pierre has arrived, and now
1|we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him in
1|any case. He has forwarded me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris is
1|now on the staff."
1|
1|The count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna's taking upon herself
1|one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.
1|
1|"Tell Bezukhov to come. I'll put his name down. Is his wife with
1|him?" he asked.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was
1|depicted on her face.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate," she said. "If what
1|we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing
1|when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul
1|as young Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to
1|give him what consolation I can."
1|
1|"Wh-what is the matter?" asked both the young and old Rostov.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna sighed deeply.
1|
1|"Dolokhov, Mary Ivanovna's son," she said in a mysterious whisper,
1|"has compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, invited
1|him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and
1|that daredevil after her!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, wishing to show
1|her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half
1|smile betraying her sympathy for the "daredevil," as she called
1|Dolokhov. "They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune."
1|
1|"Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the Club--it will all
1|blow over. It will be a tremendous banquet."
1|
1|Next day, the third of March, soon after one o'clock, two hundred
1|and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting
1|the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince
1|Bagration, to dinner.
1|
1|On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow
1|had been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to
1|victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not
1|believe it, while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so
1|strange an event. In the English Club, where all who were
1|distinguished, important, and well informed foregathered when the
1|news began to arrive in December, nothing was said about the war and
1|the last battle, as though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The
1|men who set the tone in conversation--Count Rostopchin, Prince Yuri
1|Dolgorukov, Valuev, Count Markov, and Prince Vyazemski--did not show
1|themselves at the Club, but met in private houses in intimate circles,
1|and the Moscovites who took their opinions from others--Ilya Rostov
1|among them--remained for a while without any definite opinion on the
1|subject of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that
1|something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult,
1|and so it was best to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury
1|comes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the Club's opinion
1|reappeared, and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely.
1|Reasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and impossible
1|event of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all corners
1|of Moscow the same things began to be said. These reasons were the
1|treachery of the Austrians, a defective commissariat, the treachery of
1|the Pole Przebyszewski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kutuzov's
1|incapacity, and (it was whispered) the youth and inexperience of the
1|sovereign, who had trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the
1|army, the Russian army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had
1|achieved miracles of valor. The soldiers, officers, and generals were
1|heroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagration, distinguished
1|by his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz,
1|where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day
1|beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also
1|conduced to Bagration's being selected as Moscow's hero was the fact
1|that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there. In
1|his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier
1|without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by
1|memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov. Moreover,
1|paying such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing
1|disapproval and dislike of Kutuzov.
1|
1|"Had there been no Bagration, it would have been necessary to invent
1|him," said the wit Shinshin, parodying the words of Voltaire.
1|Kutuzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,
1|calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.
1|
1|All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukov's saying: "If you go on
1|modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay," suggesting
1|consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and
1|the words of Rostopchin, that French soldiers have to be incited to
1|battle by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to
1|show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but
1|that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all
1|sides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of
1|heroism shown by our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a
1|standard, another had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five
1|cannon singlehanded. Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know
1|him, as having, when wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the
1|left, and gone forward. Of Bolkonski, nothing was said, and only those
1|who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a
1|pregnant wife with his eccentric father.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were
1|filled with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in
1|springtime. The members and guests of the Club wandered hither and
1|thither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in
1|evening dress, and a few here and there with powdered hair and in
1|Russian kaftans. Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and
1|smart stockings, stood at every door anxiously noting visitors'
1|every movement in order to offer their services. Most of those present
1|were elderly, respected men with broad, self-confident faces, fat
1|fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of guests and
1|members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual
1|groups. A minority of those present were casual guests--chiefly
1|young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov, and Dolokhov--who was
1|now again an officer in the Semenov regiment. The faces of these young
1|people, especially those who were military men, bore that expression of
1|condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older
1|generation, "We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the
1|same remember that the future belongs to us."
1|
1|Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club. Pierre, who at his
1|wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,
1|went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull.
1|Here, as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience
1|to his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people,
1|he treated them with absent-minded contempt.
1|
1|By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his
1|wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored
1|guests, and so he went from one group to another. Some of the most
1|important old men were the center of groups which even strangers
1|approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men. The
1|largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin, Valuev, and
1|Naryshkin. Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had been
1|overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through
1|them with bayonets.
1|
1|Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from
1|Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.
1|
1|In the third circle, Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
1|Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a cock in reply
1|to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinshin, standing
1|close by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had evidently
1|failed to learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of
1|crowing like a cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the
1|wit, making him feel that in that place and on that day, it was
1|improper to speak so of Kutuzov.
1|
1|Count Ilya Rostov, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft
1|boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the
1|important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all
1|equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up
1|young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostov
1|stood at a window with Dolokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made
1|and highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed
1|Dolokhov's hand.
1|
1|"Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been
1|together out there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasili
1|Ignatovich... How d'ye do, old fellow?" he said, turning to an old man
1|who was passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a
1|general stir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a
1|frightened face: "He's arrived!"
1|
1|Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and--like rye shaken
1|together in a shovel--the guests who had been scattered about in
1|different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by
1|the door of the ballroom.
1|
1|Bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or
1|sword, which, in accord with the Club custom, he had given up to the
1|hall porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded
1|whip over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of
1|the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian
1|and foreign Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast.
1|Evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and
1|whiskers trimmed, which changed his appearance for the worse. There
1|was something naively festive in his air, which, in conjunction with
1|his firm and virile features, gave him a rather comical expression.
1|Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov, who had arrived with him, paused at the
1|doorway to allow him, as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagration
1|was embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and
1|this caused some delay at the doors, but after all he did at last
1|enter first. He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of
1|the reception room, not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more
1|accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had done at
1|the head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabern--and he would have
1|found that easier. The committeemen met him at the first door and,
1|expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest, took
1|possession of him as it were, without waiting for his reply,
1|surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was at first
1|impossible to enter the drawing-room door for the crowd of members and
1|guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagration
1|over each other's shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count
1|Ilya Rostov, laughing and repeating the words, "Make way, dear boy!
1|Make way, make way!" pushed through the crowd more energetically
1|than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and seated them
1|on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the
1|Club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting his way
1|through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a
1|minute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver
1|which he presented to Prince Bagration. On the salver lay some
1|verses composed and printed in the hero's honor. Bagration, on
1|seeing the salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help.
1|But all eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in
1|their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and
1|looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it
1|to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration (or he
1|would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner
1|with it) and drew his attention to the verses.
1|
1|"Well, I will read them, then!" Bagration seemed to say, and, fixing
1|his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and
1|serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began
1|reading them aloud. Bagration bowed his head and listened:
1|
1|   Bring glory then to Alexander's reign
1|   And on the throne our Titus shield.
1|   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,
1|   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!
1|   E'en fortunate Napoleon
1|   Knows by experience, now, Bagration,
1|   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...
1|
1|But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo
1|announced that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the
1|dining room came the resounding strains of the polonaise:
1|
1|   Conquest's joyful thunder waken,
1|   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...
1|
1|and Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading
1|his verses, bowed to Bagration. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was
1|more important than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the
1|rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between
1|two Alexanders--Bekleshev and Naryshkin--which was a significant
1|allusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took
1|their seats in the dining room, according to their rank and
1|importance: the more important nearer to the honored guest, as
1|naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest.
1|
1|Just before dinner, Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to
1|Bagration, who recognized him and said a few words to him,
1|disjointed and awkward, as were all the words he spoke that day, and
1|Count Ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagration spoke to
1|his son.
1|
1|Nicholas Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov,
1|sat almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre,
1|beside Prince Nesvitski. Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of
1|the committee sat facing Bagration and, as the very personification of
1|Moscow hospitality, did the honors to the prince.
1|
1|His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and
1|the other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till
1|the end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions
1|to the footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety.
1|Everything was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet
1|(at sight of which Ilya Rostov blushed with self-conscious
1|pleasure), the footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne
1|glasses. After the fish, which made a certain sensation, the count
1|exchanged glances with the other committeemen. "There will be many
1|toasts, it's time to begin," he whispered, and taking up his glass, he
1|rose. All were silent, waiting for what he would say.
1|
1|"To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!" he cried, and at
1|the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and
1|enthusiasm. The band immediately struck up "Conquest's joyful
1|thunder waken..." All rose and cried "Hurrah!" Bagration also rose and
1|shouted "Hurrah!" in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it
1|on the field at Schon Grabern. Young Rostov's ecstatic voice could
1|be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. "To the
1|health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!" he roared, "Hurrah!" and
1|emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many
1|followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time.
1|When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass
1|and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and
1|exchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note
1|lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, "To the health of the
1|hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivanovich Bagration!" and
1|again his blue eyes grew moist. "Hurrah!" cried the three hundred
1|voices again, but instead of the band a choir began singing a
1|cantata composed by Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov:
1|
1|   Russians! O'er all barriers on!
1|   Courage conquest guarantees;
1|   Have we not Bagration?
1|   He brings foe men to their knees,... etc.
1|
1|
1|As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was
1|proposed and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved, more
1|glass was smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to
1|Bekleshev, Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, to the
1|committee, to all the Club members and to all the Club guests, and
1|finally to Count Ilya Rostov separately, as the organizer of the
1|banquet. At that toast, the count took out his handkerchief and,
1|covering his face, wept outright.

1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Pierre sat opposite Dolokhov and Nicholas Rostov. As usual, he ate
1|and drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed
1|that some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all
1|through dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed
1|eyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge
1|of his nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and
1|hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by
1|some depressing and unsolved problem.
1|
1|The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by
1|the princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dolokhov's intimacy
1|with his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that
1|morning, which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters
1|said that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that his wife's
1|connection with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre
1|absolutely disbelieved both the princess' hints and the letter, but he
1|feared now to look at Dolokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every
1|time he chanced to meet Dolokhov's handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt
1|something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly
1|away. Involuntarily recalling his wife's past and her relations with
1|Dolokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be
1|true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his
1|wife. He involuntarily remembered how Dolokhov, who had fully
1|recovered his former position after the campaign, had returned to
1|Petersburg and come to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations
1|with Pierre as a boon companion, Dolokhov had come straight to his
1|house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled
1|how Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov's living at
1|their house, and how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife's
1|beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left
1|them for a day.
1|
1|"Yes, he is very handsome," thought Pierre, "and I know him. It
1|would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule
1|me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended
1|him, and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add
1|to the pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it
1|were true, but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can't,
1|believe it." He remembered the expression Dolokhov's face assumed in
1|his moments of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and
1|dropping them into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel
1|without any reason, or shot a post-boy's horse with a pistol. That
1|expression was often on Dolokhov's face when looking at him. "Yes,
1|he is a bully," thought Pierre, "to kill a man means nothing to him.
1|It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must
1|please him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him--and in fact I
1|am afraid of him," he thought, and again he felt something terrible
1|and monstrous rising in his soul. Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov were
1|now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostov was talking
1|merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the
1|other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he
1|glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and
1|massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rostov
1|looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his
1|hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a
1|word--an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation
1|and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had not
1|responded to his greeting. When the Emperor's health was drunk,
1|Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.
1|
1|"What are you about?" shouted Rostov, looking at him in an ecstasy
1|of exasperation. "Don't you hear it's His Majesty the Emperor's
1|health?"
1|
1|Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting
1|till all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostov.
1|
1|"Why, I didn't recognize you!" he said. But Rostov was otherwise
1|engaged; he was shouting "Hurrah!"
1|
1|"Why don't you renew the acquaintance?" said Dolokhov to Rostov.
1|
1|"Confound him, he's a fool!" said Rostov.
1|
1|"One should make up to the husbands of pretty women," said Denisov.
1|
1|Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were
1|talking about him. He reddened and turned away.
1|
1|"Well, now to the health of handsome women!" said Dolokhov, and with
1|a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his
1|mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.
1|
1|"Here's to the health of lovely women, Peterkin--and their
1|lovers!" he added.
1|
1|Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking
1|at Dolokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing
1|leaflets with Kutuzov's cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of
1|the principal guests. He was just going to take it when Dolokhov,
1|leaning across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre
1|looked at Dolokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and
1|monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took
1|possession of him. He leaned his whole massive body across the table.
1|
1|"How dare you take it?" he shouted.
1|
1|Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvitski
1|and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov.
1|
1|"Don't! Don't! What are you about?" whispered their frightened
1|voices.
1|
1|Dolokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that
1|smile of his which seemed to say, "Ah! This is what I like!"
1|
1|"You shan't have it!" he said distinctly.
1|
1|Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.
1|
1|"You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!" he ejaculated, and,
1|pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.
1|
1|At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt
1|that the question of his wife's guilt which had been tormenting him
1|the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative.
1|He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Denisov's
1|request that he would take no part in the matter, Rostov agreed to
1|be Dolokhov's second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements
1|for the duel with Nesvitski, Bezukhov's second. Pierre went home,
1|but Rostov with Dolokhov and Denisov stayed on at the Club till
1|late, listening to the gypsies and other singers.
1|
1|"Well then, till tomorrow at Sokolniki," said Dolokhov, as he took
1|leave of Rostov in the Club porch.
1|
1|"And do you feel quite calm?" Rostov asked.
1|
1|Dolokhov paused.
1|
1|"Well, you see, I'll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two
1|words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write
1|affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be
1|killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the
1|firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as
1|possible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostroma
1|used to tell me. 'Everyone fears a bear,' he says, 'but when you see
1|one your fear's all gone, and your only thought is not to let him
1|get away!' And that's how it is with me. A demain, mon cher."*
1|
1|
1|*Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.
1|
1|
1|Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitski drove to the
1|Sokolniki forest and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov already
1|there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations
1|which had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face
1|was yellow. He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about
1|distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He
1|was entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wife's guilt, of
1|which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, and
1|the guiltlessness of Dolokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor
1|of a man who was nothing to him.... "I should perhaps have done the
1|same thing in his place," thought Pierre. "It's even certain that I
1|should have done the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I
1|shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee.
1|Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?" passed
1|through his mind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to
1|him, he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way,
1|which inspired the respect of the onlookers, "Will it be long? Are
1|things ready?"
1|
1|When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the
1|barriers, and the pistols loaded, Nesvitski went up to Pierre.
1|
1|"I should not be doing my duty, Count," he said in timid tones, "and
1|should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in
1|choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment
1|I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient
1|ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were
1|not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous..."
1|
1|"Oh yes, it is horribly stupid," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your
1|opponent will accept them," said Nesvitski (who like the others
1|concerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not
1|yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel). "You know,
1|Count, it is much more honorable to admit one's mistake than to let
1|matters become irreparable. There was no insult on either side.
1|Allow me to convey...."
1|
1|"No! What is there to talk about?" said Pierre. "It's all the
1|same.... Is everything ready?" he added. "Only tell me where to go and
1|where to shoot," he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.
1|
1|He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of
1|the trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand--a fact
1|that he did not wish to confess.
1|
1|"Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot," said he.
1|
1|"No apologies, none whatever," said Dolokhov to Denisov (who on
1|his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to
1|the appointed place.
1|
1|The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,
1|where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine
1|forest covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up
1|during the last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at
1|the farther edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces,
1|left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been
1|standing and Nesvitski's and Dolokhov's sabers, which were stuck
1|into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and
1|misty; at forty paces' distance nothing could be seen. For three
1|minutes all had been ready, but they still delayed and all were
1|silent.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|"Well begin!" said Dolokhov.
1|
1|"All right," said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling
1|of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly
1|begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course
1|independently of men's will.
1|
1|Denisov first went to the barrier and announced: "As the adve'sawies
1|have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your pistols,
1|and at the word thwee begin to advance.
1|
1|"O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!" he shouted angrily and stepped aside.
1|
1|The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and
1|nearer to one another, beginning to see one another through the
1|mist. They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached
1|the barrier. Dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol,
1|looking intently with his bright, sparkling blue eyes into his
1|antagonist's face. His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile.
1|
1|"So I can fire when I like!" said Pierre, and at the word "three,"
1|he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into
1|the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at arm's length,
1|apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left hand he held
1|carefully back, because he wished to support his right hand with it
1|and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and strayed
1|off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, then
1|quickly glanced at Dolokhov and, bending his finger as he had been
1|shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre
1|shuddered at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations,
1|stood still. The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him
1|from seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second report as
1|he had expected. He only heard Dolokhov's hurried steps, and his
1|figure came in view through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his
1|left side, while the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face
1|was pale. Rostov ran toward him and said something.
1|
1|"No-o-o!" muttered Dolokhov through his teeth, "no, it's not
1|over." And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the
1|saber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he
1|wiped it on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning
1|face was pallid and quivered.
1|
1|"Plea..." began Dolokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.
1|
1|"Please," he uttered with an effort.
1|
1|Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dolokhov
1|and was about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dolokhov
1|cried:
1|
1|"To your barrier!" and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by
1|his saber. Only ten paces divided them. Dolokhov lowered his head to
1|the snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself,
1|drew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He
1|sucked and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but
1|his eyes, still smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as
1|he mustered his remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.
1|
1|"Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!" ejaculated Nesvitski.
1|
1|"Cover yourself!" even Denisov cried to his adversary.
1|
1|Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs
1|helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing
1|Dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitski
1|closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report and
1|Dolokhov's angry cry.
1|
1|"Missed!" shouted Dolokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on
1|the snow.
1|
1|Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,
1|trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:
1|
1|"Folly... folly! Death... lies..." he repeated, puckering his face.
1|
1|Nesvitski stopped him and took him home.
1|
1|Rostov and Denisov drove away with the wounded Dolokhov.
1|
1|The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not
1|answer a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering
1|Moscow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort,
1|took Rostov, who was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostov was
1|struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender
1|expression on Dolokhov's face.
1|
1|"Well? How do you feel?" he asked.
1|
1|"Bad! But it's not that, my friend-" said Dolokhov with a gasping
1|voice. "Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don't matter, but I have
1|killed her, killed... She won't get over it! She won't survive...."
1|
1|"Who?" asked Rostov.
1|
1|"My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother," and
1|Dolokhov pressed Rostov's hand and burst into tears.
1|
1|When he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostov that
1|he was living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not
1|survive it. He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her.
1|
1|Rostov went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise
1|learned that Dolokhov the brawler, Dolokhov the bully, lived in Moscow
1|with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most
1|affectionate of sons and brothers.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg
1|and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after
1|the duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained
1|in his father's room, that huge room in which Count Bezukhov had died.
1|
1|He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
1|had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,
1|thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not
1|fall asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace
1|the room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early
1|days of their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid,
1|passionate look on her face, and then immediately he saw beside her
1|Dolokhov's handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen
1|it at the banquet, and then that same face pale, quivering, and
1|suffering, as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow.
1|
1|"What has happened?" he asked himself. "I have killed her lover,
1|yes, killed my wife's lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come
1|to do it?"--"Because you married her," answered an inner voice.
1|
1|"But in what was I to blame?" he asked. "In marrying her without
1|loving her; in deceiving yourself and her." And he vividly recalled
1|that moment after supper at Prince Vasili's, when he spoke those words
1|he had found so difficult to utter: "I love you." "It all comes from
1|that! Even then I felt it," he thought. "I felt then that it was not
1|so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out."
1|
1|He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.
1|Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection
1|of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into
1|his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his
1|head steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and
1|at his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing
1|respectful understanding of his employer's happiness.
1|
1|"But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic
1|beauty and social tact," thought he; "been proud of my house, in
1|which she received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and
1|beauty. So this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did
1|not understand her. How often when considering her character I have
1|told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her, for not
1|understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of
1|all interests or desires, and the whole secret lies in the terrible
1|truth that she is a depraved woman. Now I have spoken that terrible
1|word to myself all has become clear.
1|
1|"Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
1|naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be
1|kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied
1|with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: 'Let him
1|do what he pleases,' she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she
1|felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she
1|was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to
1|have any children by me."
1|
1|Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and
1|the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though
1|she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.
1|
1|"I'm not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous
1|promener,"* she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with
1|young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not
1|love her.
1|
1|
1|*"You clear out of this."
1|
1|
1|"Yes, I never loved her," said he to himself; "I knew she was a
1|depraved woman," he repeated, "but dared not admit it to myself. And
1|now there's Dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and
1|perhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!"
1|
1|Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of
1|what is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their
1|troubles. He digested his sufferings alone.
1|
1|"It is all, all her fault," he said to himself; "but what of that?
1|Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I say 'Je vous aime'* to her,
1|which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must
1|endure... what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that's
1|nonsense," he thought. "The slur on my name and honor--that's all
1|apart from myself.
1|
1|
1|*I love you.
1|
1|
1|"Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
1|criminal," came into Pierre's head, "and from their point of view they
1|were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr's
1|death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot.
1|Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive--live:
1|tomorrow you'll die as I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth
1|tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison
1|with eternity?"
1|
1|But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such
1|reflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments
1|when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he
1|felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move
1|about and break and tear whatever came to his hand. "Why did I tell
1|her that 'Je vous aime'?" he kept repeating to himself. And when he
1|had said it for the tenth time, Molibre's words: "Mais que diable
1|alloit-il faire dans cette galere?" occurred to him, and he began to
1|laugh at himself.
1|
1|In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
1|Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He
1|resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
1|intention to part from her forever.
1|
1|Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee,
1|Pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.
1|
1|He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled
1|expression, unable to realize where he was.
1|
1|"The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at
1|home," said the valet.
1|
1|But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the
1|countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with
1|silver and with simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round
1|her lovely head like a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic,
1|except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent
1|marble brow. With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in
1|front of the valet. She knew of the duel and had come to speak about
1|it. She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and
1|left the room. Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles, and
1|like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and
1|continues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he tried to
1|continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and impossible,
1|he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but looked at
1|him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go.
1|
1|"Well, what's this now? What have you been up to now, I should
1|like to know?" she asked sternly.
1|
1|"I? What have I...?" stammered Pierre.
1|
1|"So it seems you're a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel
1|about? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you."
1|
1|Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth,
1|but could not reply.
1|
1|"If you won't answer, I'll tell you..." Helene went on. "You believe
1|everything you're told. You were told..." Helene laughed, "that
1|Dolokhov was my lover," she said in French with her coarse plainness
1|of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other word, "and
1|you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel
1|prove? That you're a fool, que vous etes un sot, but everybody knew
1|that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of
1|all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing
1|what you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without
1|cause." Helene raised her voice and became more and more excited, "A
1|man who's a better man than you in every way..."
1|
1|"Hm... Hm...!" growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her,
1|and not moving a muscle.
1|
1|"And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like
1|his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should
1|prefer yours."
1|
1|"Don't speak to me... I beg you," muttered Pierre hoarsely.
1|
1|"Why shouldn't I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you
1|plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who
1|would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,"
1|said she.
1|
1|Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose
1|strange expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He
1|was suffering physically at that moment, there was a weight on his
1|chest and he could not breathe. He knew that he must do something to
1|put an end to this suffering, but what he wanted to do was too
1|terrible.
1|
1|"We had better separate," he muttered in a broken voice.
1|
1|"Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune," said
1|Helene. "Separate! That's a thing to frighten me with!"
1|
1|Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.
1|
1|"I'll kill you!" he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table
1|with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her
1|brandishing the slab.
1|
1|Helene's face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His
1|father's nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and
1|delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down
1|on her with outstretched hands shouted, "Get out!" in such a
1|terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows
1|what he would have done at that moment had Helene not fled from the
1|room.
1|
1|
1|A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his
1|estates in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property,
1|and left for Petersburg alone.

1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz
1|and the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite
1|of the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his
1|body had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What
1|was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a
1|possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the
1|people of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or
1|dying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. The
1|gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at
1|Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after
1|brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made
1|their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this
1|official report that our army had been defeated. A week after the
1|gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from
1|Kutuzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.
1|
1|"Your son," wrote Kutuzov, "fell before my eyes, a standard in his
1|hand and at the head of a regiment--he fell as a hero, worthy of his
1|father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the
1|whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort
1|myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise
1|he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field
1|of battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce."
1|
1|After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone
1|in his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next
1|morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the
1|architect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.
1|
1|When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at
1|his lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.
1|
1|"Ah, Princess Mary!" he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,
1|throwing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own
1|impetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that
1|wheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)
1|
1|She approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her.
1|Her eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father's face, not sad,
1|not crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging
1|over her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the
1|worst in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and
1|incomprehensible--the death of one she loved.
1|
1|"Father! Andrew!"--said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such
1|an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her
1|father could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.
1|
1|"Bad news! He's not among the prisoners nor among the killed!
1|Kutuzov writes..." and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to
1|drive the princess away by that scream... "Killed!"
1|
1|The princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but
1|on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in
1|her beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy--a supreme joy apart
1|from the joys and sorrows of this world--overflowed the great grief
1|within her. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took
1|his hand, and drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy
1|neck.
1|
1|"Father," she said, "do not turn away from me, let us weep together."
1|
1|"Scoundrels! Blackguards!" shrieked the old man, turning his face
1|away from her. "Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why?
1|Go, go and tell Lise."
1|
1|The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father
1|and wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he
1|took leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw
1|him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. "Did
1|he believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There
1|in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness?" she thought.
1|
1|"Father, tell me how it happened," she asked through her tears.
1|
1|"Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and
1|Russia's glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell
1|Lise. I will follow."
1|
1|When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat
1|working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy
1|calm peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did
1|not see Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at
1|something joyful and mysterious taking place within her.
1|
1|"Mary," she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying
1|back, "give me your hand." She took her sister-in-law's hand and
1|held it below her waist.
1|
1|Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained
1|lifted in childlike happiness.
1|
1|Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of
1|her sister-in-law's dress.
1|
1|"There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,
1|Mary, I am going to love him very much," said Lise, looking with
1|bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.
1|
1|Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.
1|
1|"What is the matter, Mary?"
1|
1|"Nothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew," she said, wiping
1|away her tears on her sister-in-law's knee.
1|
1|Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began
1|trying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry.
1|Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of
1|which she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but
1|looked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner
1|the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with
1|a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without
1|saying a word. She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a
1|while with that expression of attention to something within her that
1|is only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry.
1|
1|"Has anything come from Andrew?" she asked.
1|
1|"No, you know it's too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I
1|feel afraid."
1|
1|"So there's nothing?"
1|
1|"Nothing," answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant
1|eyes at her sister-in-law.
1|
1|She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to
1|hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement, which
1|was expected within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince
1|each bore and hid their grief in their own way. The old prince would
1|not cherish any hope: he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had
1|been killed, and though he sent an official to Austria to seek for
1|traces of his son, he ordered a monument from Moscow which he intended
1|to erect in his own garden to his memory, and he told everybody that
1|his son had been killed. He tried not to change his former way of
1|life, but his strength failed him. He walked less, ate less, slept
1|less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary hoped. She prayed for
1|her brother as living and was always awaiting news of his return.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|"Dearest," said the little princess after breakfast on the morning
1|of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit,
1|but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word,
1|and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had
1|come, so now the smile of the little princess--influenced by the
1|general mood though without knowing its cause--was such as to remind
1|one still more of the general sorrow.
1|
1|"Dearest, I'm afraid this morning's fruschtique*--as Foka the cook
1|calls it--has disagreed with me."
1|
1|
1|*Fruhstuck: breakfast.
1|
1|
1|"What is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you are
1|very pale!" said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,
1|ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.
1|
1|"Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdanovna be sent for?" said
1|one of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogdanovna was a midwife
1|from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last
1|fortnight.)
1|
1|"Oh yes," assented Princess Mary, "perhaps that's it. I'll go.
1|Courage, my angel." She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.
1|
1|"Oh, no, no!" And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on
1|the little princess' face, an expression of childish fear of
1|inevitable pain showed itself.
1|
1|"No, it's only indigestion?... Say it's only indigestion, say so,
1|Mary! Say..." And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a
1|suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
1|affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary
1|Bogdanovna.
1|
1|"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!" she heard as she left the room.
1|
1|The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small,
1|plump white hands with an air of calm importance.
1|
1|"Mary Bogdanovna, I think it's beginning!" said Princess Mary
1|looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.
1|
1|"Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess," said Mary Bogdanovna, not
1|hastening her steps. "You young ladies should not know anything
1|about it."
1|
1|"But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?" said the
1|princess. (In accordance with Lise's and Prince Andrew's wishes they
1|had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at
1|any moment.)
1|
1|"No matter, Princess, don't be alarmed," said Mary Bogdanovna.
1|"We'll manage very well without a doctor."
1|
1|Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy
1|being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the
1|large leather sofa from Prince Andrew's study into the bedroom. On
1|their faces was a quiet and solemn look.
1|
1|Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
1|house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and
1|watching what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with
1|quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and
1|turned away. She did not venture to ask any questions, and shut the
1|door again, now sitting down in her easy chair, now taking her
1|prayer book, now kneeling before the icon stand. To her surprise and
1|distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement.
1|Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse, Praskovya Savishna,
1|who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden
1|it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head.
1|
1|"I've come to sit with you a bit, Masha," said the nurse, "and
1|here I've brought the prince's wedding candles to light before his
1|saint, my angel," she said with a sigh.
1|
1|"Oh, nurse, I'm so glad!"
1|
1|"God is merciful, birdie."
1|
1|The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by
1|the door with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began
1|reading. Only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one
1|another, the princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging.
1|Everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that
1|Princess Mary experienced as she sat in her room. But owing to the
1|superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman
1|in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one
1|spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good
1|manners habitual in the prince's household, a common anxiety, a
1|softening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and
1|mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt.
1|
1|There was no laughter in the maids' large hall. In the men servants'
1|hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs'
1|quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old
1|prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent
1|Tikhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what news.--"Say only that 'the prince
1|told me to ask,' and come and tell me her answer."
1|
1|"Inform the prince that labor has begun," said Mary Bogdanovna,
1|giving the messenger a significant look.
1|
1|Tikhon went and told the prince.
1|
1|"Very good!" said the prince closing the door behind him, and Tikhon
1|did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.
1|
1|After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and,
1|seeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his
1|perturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed
1|him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles
1|or saying why he had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world
1|continued its course. Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of
1|suspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable
1|did not lessen but increased. No one slept.
1|
1|It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume
1|its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A
1|relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German
1|doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback
1|with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the
1|country road with its hollows and snow-covered pools of water.
1|
1|Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her
1|luminous eyes fixed on her nurse's wrinkled face (every line of
1|which she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from
1|under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.
1|
1|Nurse Savishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely
1|hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds
1|of times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess
1|Mary in Kishenev with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead
1|of a midwife.
1|
1|"God is merciful, doctors are never needed," she said.
1|
1|Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
1|window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of
1|the prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the
1|larks returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the
1|damask curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill,
1|snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the
1|stocking she was knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to
1|catch the open casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her
1|kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.
1|
1|"Princess, my dear, there's someone driving up the avenue!" she
1|said, holding the casement and not closing it. "With lanterns. Most
1|likely the doctor."
1|
1|"Oh, my God! thank God!" said Princess Mary. "I must go and meet
1|him, he does not know Russian."
1|
1|Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the
1|newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the
1|window a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went
1|out on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow candle which
1|guttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, the footman,
1|stood looking scared and holding another candle. Still lower, beyond
1|the turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of someone in
1|thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary
1|was saying something.
1|
1|"Thank God!" said the voice. "And Father?"
1|
1|"Gone to bed," replied the voice of Demyan the house steward, who
1|was downstairs.
1|
1|Then the voice said something more, Demyan replied, and the steps in
1|the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more
1|rapidly.
1|
1|"It's Andrew!" thought Princess Mary. "No it can't be, that would be
1|too extraordinary," and at the very moment she thought this, the
1|face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of
1|which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman
1|stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed
1|and strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up
1|the stairs and embraced his sister.
1|
1|"You did not get my letter?" he asked, and not waiting for a
1|reply--which he would not have received, for the princess was unable
1|to speak--he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the
1|doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last
1|post station), and again embraced his sister.
1|
1|"What a strange fate, Masha darling!" And having taken off his cloak
1|and felt boots, he went to the little princess' apartment.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on
1|her head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair
1|lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy
1|mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince
1|Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on
1|which she was lying. Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear
1|and excitement, rested on him without changing their expression. "I
1|love you all and have done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so?
1|Help me!" her look seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not
1|realize the significance of his appearance before her now. Prince
1|Andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead.
1|
1|"My darling!" he said--a word he had never used to her before.
1|"God is merciful...."
1|
1|She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.
1|
1|"I expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!"
1|said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did not
1|realize that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with her
1|sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary
1|Bogdanovna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.
1|
1|The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess
1|Mary, again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk
1|broke off at every moment. They waited and listened.
1|
1|"Go, dear," said Princess Mary.
1|
1|Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room
1|next to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and
1|became confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with
1|his hands and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless,
1|animal moans came through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to
1|the door, and tried to open it. Someone was holding it shut.
1|
1|"You can't come in! You can't!" said a terrified voice from within.
1|
1|He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more
1|seconds went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek--it could not be
1|hers, she could not scream like that--came from the bedroom. Prince
1|Andrew ran to the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of
1|an infant.
1|
1|"What have they taken a baby in there for?" thought Prince Andrew in
1|the first second. "A baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or
1|is the baby born?"
1|
1|Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail;
1|tears choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began
1|to cry, sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his
1|shirt sleeves tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling
1|jaw, came out of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor
1|gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman
1|rushed out and seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the
1|threshold. He went into his wife's room. She was lying dead, in the
1|same position he had seen her in five minutes before and, despite
1|the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the same expression was
1|on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny
1|black hair.
1|
1|"I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have
1|you done to me?"--said her charming, pathetic, dead face.
1|
1|In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and
1|squealed in Mary Bogdanovna's trembling white hands.
1|
1|
1|Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his
1|father's room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing
1|close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed
1|like a vise round his son's neck, and without a word he began to sob
1|like a child.
1|
1|
1|Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew
1|went up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the
1|farewell kiss. And there in the coffin was the same face, though
1|with closed eyes. "Ah, what have you done to me?" it still seemed to
1|say, and Prince Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and
1|that he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He
1|could not weep. The old man too came up and kissed the waxen little
1|hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on her breast, and
1|to him, too, her face seemed to say: "Ah, what have you done to me,
1|and why?" And at the sight the old man turned angrily away.
1|
1|
1|Another five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas
1|Andreevich was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her
1|chin, while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy's little
1|red and wrinkled soles and palms.
1|
1|His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of
1|dropping him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and
1|handed him over to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat
1|in another room, faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in
1|the font, and awaited the termination of the ceremony. He looked up
1|joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded
1|approval when she told him that the wax with the baby's hair had not
1|sunk in the font but had floated.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Rostov's share in Dolokhov's duel with Bezukhov was hushed up by the
1|efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks
1|as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
1|Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of
1|the family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties.
1|Dolokhov recovered, and Rostov became very friendly with him during
1|his convalescence. Dolokhov lay ill at his mother's who loved him
1|passionately and tenderly, and old Mary Ivanovna, who had grown fond
1|of Rostov for his friendship to her Fedya, often talked to him about
1|her son.
1|
1|"Yes, Count," she would say, "he is too noble and pure-souled for
1|our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like
1|a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it
1|honorable, of Bezukhov? And Fedya, with his noble spirit, loved him
1|and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg
1|when they played some tricks on a policeman, didn't they do it
1|together? And there! Bezukhov got off scotfree, while Fedya had to
1|bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go
1|through! It's true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail
1|to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons of the
1|fatherland out there as he. And now--this duel! Have these people no
1|feeling, or honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and
1|shoot so straight! It's well God had mercy on us. And what was it for?
1|Who doesn't have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I
1|see things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for
1|months. And then to call him out, reckoning on Fedya not fighting
1|because he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you
1|understand Fedya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond
1|of you. Few people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly
1|soul!"
1|
1|Dolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostov in a way
1|no one would have expected of him.
1|
1|"I know people consider me a bad man!" he said. "Let them! I don't
1|care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love, I love
1|so that I would give my life for them, and the others I'd throttle
1|if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, and two
1|or three friends--you among them--and as for the rest I only care
1|about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of them
1|are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy," he continued, "I
1|have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met any
1|women--countesses or cooks--who were not venal. I have not yet met
1|that divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a
1|one I'd give my life for her! But those!..." and he made a gesture of
1|contempt. "And believe me, if I still value my life it is only because
1|I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will regenerate,
1|purify, and elevate me. But you don't understand it."
1|
1|"Oh, yes, I quite understand," answered Rostov, who was under his
1|new friend's influence.
1|
1|In the autumn the Rostovs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter
1|Denisov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the
1|winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow, was one of
1|the happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas
1|brought many young men to his parents' house. Vera was a handsome girl
1|of twenty; Sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening
1|flower; Natasha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly
1|amusing, now girlishly enchanting.
1|
1|At that time in the Rostovs' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere
1|characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming
1|girls. Every young man who came to the house--seeing those
1|impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own
1|happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful
1|bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
1|young girls ready for anything and full of hope--experienced the same
1|feeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rostovs' household a
1|readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.
1|
1|Among the young men introduced by Rostov one of the first was
1|Dolokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Natasha. She
1|almost quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he
1|was a bad man, and that in the duel with Bezukhov, Pierre was right
1|and Dolokhov wrong, and further that he was disagreeable and
1|unnatural.
1|
1|"There's nothing for me to understand," she cried out with resolute
1|self-will, "he is wicked and heartless. There now, I like your Denisov
1|though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so you see I do
1|understand. I don't know how to put it... with this one everything
1|is calculated, and I don't like that. But Denisov..."
1|
1|"Oh, Denisov is quite different," replied Nicholas, implying that
1|even Denisov was nothing compared to Dolokhov--"you must understand
1|what a soul there is in Dolokhov, you should see him with his
1|mother. What a heart!"
1|
1|"Well, I don't know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And
1|do you know he has fallen in love with Sonya?"
1|
1|"What nonsense..."
1|
1|"I'm certain of it; you'll see."
1|
1|Natasha's prediction proved true. Dolokhov, who did not usually care
1|for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the
1|question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon
1|settled. He came because of Sonya. And Sonya, though she would never
1|have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time
1|Dolokhov appeared.
1|
1|Dolokhov often dined at the Rostovs', never missed a performance
1|at which they were present, and went to Iogel's balls for young people
1|which the Rostovs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to Sonya
1|and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
1|glances without coloring, but even the old countess and Natasha
1|blushed when they saw his looks.
1|
1|It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the
1|irresistible influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.
1|
1|Rostov noticed something new in Dolokhov's relations with Sonya, but
1|he did not explain to himself what these new relations were.
1|"They're always in love with someone," he thought of Sonya and
1|Natasha. But he was not as much at ease with Sonya and Dolokhov as
1|before and was less frequently at home.
1|
1|In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war
1|with Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders
1|were given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the
1|regular army, and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the
1|militia. Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow
1|nothing but the coming war was talked of. For the Rostov family the
1|whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that
1|Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the
1|termination of Denisov's furlough after Christmas to return with him
1|to their regiment. His approaching departure did not prevent his
1|amusing himself, but rather gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the
1|greater part of his time away from home, at dinners, parties, and
1|balls.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing
1|he had rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he
1|and Denisov were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany.
1|About twenty people were present, including Dolokhov and Denisov.
1|
1|Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous
1|atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostovs' house as at
1|this holiday time. "Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!
1|That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the
1|one thing we are interested in here," said the spirit of the place.
1|
1|Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without
1|visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been
1|invited, returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he
1|noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also
1|noticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present. Sonya,
1|Dolokhov, and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a
1|lesser degree Natasha. Nicholas understood that something must have
1|happened between Sonya and Dolokhov before dinner, and with the kindly
1|sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both
1|at dinner. On that same evening there was to be one of the balls
1|that Iogel (the dancing master) gave for his pupils during the
1|holidays.
1|
1|"Nicholas, will you come to Iogel's? Please do!" said Natasha. "He
1|asked you, and Vasili Dmitrich* is also going."
1|
1|
1|*Denisov.
1|
1|
1|"Where would I not go at the countess' command!" said Denisov, who
1|at the Rostovs' had jocularly assumed the role of Natasha's knight.
1|"I'm even weady to dance the pas de chale."
1|
1|"If I have time," answered Nicholas. "But I promised the
1|Arkharovs; they have a party."
1|
1|"And you?" he asked Dolokhov, but as soon as he had asked the
1|question he noticed that it should not have been put.
1|
1|"Perhaps," coldly and angrily replied Dolokhov, glancing at Sonya,
1|and, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given
1|Pierre at the Club dinner.
1|
1|"There is something up," thought Nicholas, and he was further
1|confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that Dolokhov left
1|immediately after dinner. He called Natasha and asked her what was the
1|matter.
1|
1|"And I was looking for you," said Natasha running out to him. "I
1|told you, but you would not believe it," she said triumphantly. "He
1|has proposed to Sonya!"
1|
1|Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sonya of late,
1|something seemed to give way within him at this news. Dolokhov was a
1|suitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless,
1|orphan girl. From the point of view of the old countess and of society
1|it was out of the question for her to refuse him. And therefore
1|Nicholas' first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with
1|Sonya.... He tried to say, "That's capital; of course she'll forget
1|her childish promises and accept the offer," but before he had time to
1|say it Natasha began again.
1|
1|"And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!" adding, after a
1|pause, "she told him she loved another."
1|
1|"Yes, my Sonya could not have done otherwise!" thought Nicholas.
1|
1|"Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won't change
1|once she has said..."
1|
1|"And Mamma pressed her!" said Nicholas reproachfully.
1|
1|"Yes," said Natasha. "Do you know, Nicholas--don't be angry--but I
1|know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know
1|for certain that you won't marry her."
1|
1|"Now you don't know that at all!" said Nicholas. "But I must talk to
1|her. What a darling Sonya is!" he added with a smile.
1|
1|"Ah, she is indeed a darling! I'll send her to you."
1|
1|And Natasha kissed her brother and ran away.
1|
1|A minute later Sonya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared
1|look. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the
1|first time since his return that they had talked alone and about their
1|love.
1|
1|"Sophie," he began, timidly at first and then more and more
1|boldly, "if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and
1|advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend..."
1|
1|Sonya interrupted him.
1|
1|"I have already refused," she said hurriedly.
1|
1|"If you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I..."
1|
1|Sonya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.
1|
1|"Nicholas, don't tell me that!" she said.
1|
1|"No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to
1|say it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole
1|truth. I love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else...."
1|
1|"That is enough for me," said Sonya, blushing.
1|
1|"No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love
1|again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,
1|confidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does
1|not wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider
1|Dolokhov's offer," he said, articulating his friend's name with
1|difficulty.
1|
1|"Don't say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and
1|always shall, and I want nothing more."
1|
1|"You are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of
1|misleading you."
1|
1|And Nicholas again kissed her hand.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|Iogel's were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers
1|as they watched their young people executing their newly learned
1|steps, and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced
1|till they were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and
1|women who came to these balls with an air of condescension and found
1|them most enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these
1|balls. The two pretty young Princesses Gorchakov met suitors there and
1|were married and so further increased the fame of these dances. What
1|distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess
1|and the presence of the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a
1|feather and bowing according to the rules of his art, as he
1|collected the tickets from all his visitors. There was the fact that
1|only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of
1|thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first
1|time. With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be,
1|pretty--so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes.
1|Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom Natasha, who was
1|exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas de chale, but
1|at this last ball only the ecossaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka,
1|which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a
1|ballroom in Bezukhov's house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a
1|great success. There were many pretty girls and the Rostov girls
1|were among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay.
1|That evening, proud of Dolokhov's proposal, her refusal, and her
1|explanation with Nicholas, Sonya twirled about before she left home so
1|that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was
1|transparently radiant with impulsive joy.
1|
1|Natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
1|ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with
1|pink ribbons.
1|
1|Natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She
1|was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever
1|person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.
1|
1|"Oh, how delightful it is!" she kept saying, running up to Sonya.
1|
1|Nicholas and Denisov were walking up and down, looking with kindly
1|patronage at the dancers.
1|
1|"How sweet she is--she will be a weal beauty!" said Denisov.
1|
1|"Who?"
1|
1|"Countess Natasha," answered Denisov.
1|
1|"And how she dances! What gwace!" he said again after a pause.
1|
1|"Who are you talking about?"
1|
1|"About your sister," ejaculated Denisov testily.
1|
1|Rostov smiled.
1|
1|"My dear count, you were one of my best pupils--you must dance,"
1|said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. "Look how many charming young
1|ladies-" He turned with the same request to Denisov who was also a
1|former pupil of his.
1|
1|"No, my dear fellow, I'll be a wallflower," said Denisov. "Don't you
1|wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?"
1|
1|"Oh no!" said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. "You were only
1|inattentive, but you had talent--oh yes, you had talent!"
1|
1| The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not
1|refuse Iogel and asked Sonya to dance. Denisov sat down by the old
1|ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot,
1|told them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the
1|young people dancing, Iogel with Natasha, his pride and his best
1|pupil, were the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with
1|his little feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with
1|Natasha, who, though shy, went on carefully executing her steps.
1|Denisov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber
1|in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was
1|because he would not and not because he could not. In the middle of
1|a figure he beckoned to Rostov who was passing:
1|
1|"This is not at all the thing," he said. "What sort of Polish
1|mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly."
1|
1|Knowing that Denisov had a reputation even in Poland for the
1|masterly way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to
1|Natasha:
1|
1|"Go and choose Denisov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!" he said.
1|
1|When it came to Natasha's turn to choose a partner, she rose and,
1|tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran
1|timidly to the corner where Denisov sat. She saw that everybody was
1|looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Denisov was refusing
1|though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.
1|
1|"Please, Vasili Dmitrich," Natasha was saying, "do come!"
1|
1|"Oh no, let me off, Countess," Denisov replied.
1|
1|"Now then, Vaska," said Nicholas.
1|
1|"They coax me as if I were Vaska the cat!" said Denisov jokingly.
1|
1|"I'll sing for you a whole evening," said Natasha.
1|
1|"Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!" said Denisov, and he
1|unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his
1|partner's hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,
1|waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was
1|Denisov's short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow
1|he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked
1|sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly
1|stamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew
1|round the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on
1|one foot half across the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs
1|was dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and
1|spreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood so a
1|second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round,
1|and, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a
1|circle. Natasha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to
1|him followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round,
1|holding her now with his left, now with his right hand, then falling
1|on one knee he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed
1|so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through
1|the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he
1|suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When
1|at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair,
1|he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natasha did not
1|even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,
1|smiling as if she did not recognize him.
1|
1|"What does this mean?" she brought out.
1|
1|Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka,
1|everyone was delighted with Denisov's skill, he was asked again and
1|again as a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about
1|Poland and the good old days. Denisov, flushed after the mazurka and
1|mopping himself with his handkerchief, sat down by Natasha and did not
1|leave her for the rest of the evening.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his own or at
1|Dolokhov's home: on the third day he received a note from him:
1|
1|
1|As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
1|of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell
1|supper tonight to my friends--come to the English Hotel.
1|
1|
1|About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight from the
1|theater, where he had been with his family and Denisov. He was at once
1|shown to the best room, which Dolokhov had taken for that evening.
1|Some twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dolokhov sat
1|between two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper
1|money, and he was keeping the bank. Rostov had not seen him since
1|his proposal and Sonya's refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought
1|of how they would meet.
1|
1|Dolokhov's clear, cold glance met Rostov as soon as he entered the
1|door, as though he had long expected him.
1|
1|"It's a long time since we met," he said. "Thanks for coming. I'll
1|just finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will come with his chorus."
1|
1|"I called once or twice at your house," said Rostov, reddening.
1|
1|Dolokhov made no reply.
1|
1|"You may punt," he said.
1|
1|Rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once
1|had with Dolokhov. "None but fools trust to luck in play," Dolokhov
1|had then said.
1|
1|"Or are you afraid to play with me?" Dolokhov now asked as if
1|guessing Rostov's thought.
1|
1|Beneath his smile Rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the
1|Club dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he
1|had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually
1|cruel, action.
1|
1|Rostov felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke
1|with which to reply to Dolokhov's words. But before he had thought
1|of anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and
1|deliberately so that everyone could hear:
1|
1|"Do you remember we had a talk about cards... 'He's a fool who
1|trusts to luck, one should make certain,' and I want to try."
1|
1|"To try his luck or the certainty?" Rostov asked himself.
1|
1|"Well, you'd better not play," Dolokhov added, and springing a new
1|pack of cards said: "Bank, gentlemen!"
1|
1|Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostov sat down by his
1|side and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.
1|
1|"Why don't you play?" he asked.
1|
1|And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up
1|a card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.
1|
1|"I have no money with me," he said.
1|
1|"I'll trust you."
1|
1|Rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and
1|again lost. Dolokhov "killed," that is, beat, ten cards of Rostov's
1|running.
1|
1|"Gentlemen," said Dolokhov after he had dealt for some time. "Please
1|place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning."
1|
1|One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.
1|
1|"Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I
1|ask you to put the money on your cards," replied Dolokhov. "Don't
1|stint yourself, we'll settle afterwards," he added, turning to Rostov.
1|
1|The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.
1|
1|All Rostov's cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles
1|scored up against him. He wrote "800 rubles" on a card, but while
1|the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to
1|his usual stake of twenty rubles.
1|
1|"Leave it," said Dolokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking
1|at Rostov, "you'll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others
1|but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?" he asked again.
1|
1|Rostov submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a
1|seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the
1|floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the
1|seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written
1|"800 rubles" in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm
1|champagne that was handed him, smiled at Dolokhov's words, and with
1|a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at Dolokhov's
1|hands which held the pack. Much depended on Rostov's winning or losing
1|on that seven of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had
1|given his son two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked
1|speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all
1|he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical
1|this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough
1|for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more
1|till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that
1|money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of
1|sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word.
1|With a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov's hands and thought, "Now
1|then, make haste and let me have this card and I'll take my cap and
1|drive home to supper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and will
1|certainly never touch a card again." At that moment his home life,
1|jokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with Natasha, piquet with
1|his father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the
1|Povarskaya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm
1|that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss,
1|long past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the
1|seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him
1|of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and
1|plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could
1|not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov's
1|hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from
1|under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a
1|pipe that were handed him.
1|
1|"So you are not afraid to play with me?" repeated Dolokhov, and as
1|if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in
1|his chair, and began deliberately with a smile:
1|
1|"Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a rumor going about Moscow
1|that I'm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful."
1|
1|"Come now, deal!" exclaimed Rostov.
1|
1|"Oh, those Moscow gossips!" said Dolokhov, and he took up the
1|cards with a smile.
1|
1|"Aah!" Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The
1|seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He
1|had lost more than he could pay.
1|
1|"Still, don't ruin yourself!" said Dolokhov with a side glance at
1|Rostov as he continued to deal.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|An hour and a half later most of the players were but little
1|interested in their own play.
1|
1|The whole interest was concentrated on Rostov. Instead of sixteen
1|hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,
1|which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he
1|vaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it
1|already exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dolokhov was no longer
1|listening to stories or telling them, but followed every movement of
1|Rostov's hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against
1|him. He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three
1|thousand. He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the
1|sum of his and Sonya's joint ages. Rostov, leaning his head on both
1|hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with
1|spilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did
1|not leave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy
1|wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he
1|loved and hated, held him in their power.
1|
1|"Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back's
1|impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or
1|quits... it can't be!... And why is he doing this to me?" Rostov
1|pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but Dolokhov refused to
1|accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him,
1|and at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at
1|the bridge over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came
1|first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him,
1|now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and
1|tried staking the total of his losses on it, then he looked round
1|for aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of
1|Dolokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.
1|
1|"He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can't want my
1|ruin. Wasn't he my friend? Wasn't I fond of him? But it's not his
1|fault. What's he to do if he has such luck?... And it's not my fault
1|either," he thought to himself, "I have done nothing wrong. Have I
1|killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a
1|terrible misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago
1|I came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to
1|buy that casket for Mamma's name day and then going home. I was so
1|happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I
1|was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things
1|begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place
1|at this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned
1|agile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has happened?
1|I am well and strong and still the same and in the same place. No,
1|it can't be! Surely it will all end in nothing!"
1|
1|He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not
1|hot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its
1|helpless efforts to seem calm.
1|
1|The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three
1|thousand. Rostov had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of
1|which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his
1|score, when Dolokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside
1|and began rapidly adding up the total of Rostov's debt, breaking the
1|chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.
1|
1|"Supper, it's time for supper! And here are the gypsies!"
1|
1|Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold
1|outside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas
1|understood that it was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:
1|
1|"Well, won't you go on? I had a splendid card all ready," as if it
1|were the fun of the game which interested him most.
1|
1|"It's all up! I'm lost!" thought he. "Now a bullet through my
1|brain--that's all that's left me!" And at the same time he said in a
1|cheerful voice:
1|
1|"Come now, just this one more little card!"
1|
1|"All right!" said Dolokhov, having finished the addition. "All
1|right! Twenty-one rubles," he said, pointing to the figure
1|twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three
1|thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rostov
1|submissively unbent the corner of his card and, instead of the six
1|thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.
1|
1|"It's all the same to me," he said. "I only want to see whether
1|you will let me win this ten, or beat it."
1|
1|Dolokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostov detested at that
1|moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy
1|wrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.
1|
1|"You owe forty-three thousand, Count," said Dolokhov, and stretching
1|himself he rose from the table. "One does get tired sitting so
1|long," he added.
1|
1|"Yes, I'm tired too," said Rostov.
1|
1|Dolokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for
1|him to jest.
1|
1|"When am I to receive the money, Count?"
1|
1|Rostov, flushing, drew Dolokhov into the next room.
1|
1|"I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?" he said.
1|
1|"I say, Rostov," said Dolokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas
1|straight in the eyes, "you know the saying, 'Lucky in love, unlucky at
1|cards.' Your cousin is in love with you, I know."
1|
1|"Oh, it's terrible to feel oneself so in this man's power,"
1|thought Rostov. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father
1|and mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be
1|to escape it all, and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him
1|from all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a
1|cat does with a mouse.
1|
1|"Your cousin..." Dolokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted
1|him.
1|
1|"My cousin has nothing to do with this and it's not necessary to
1|mention her!" he exclaimed fiercely.
1|
1|"Then when am I to have it?"
1|
1|"Tomorrow," replied Rostov and left the room.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|To say "tomorrow" and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult,
1|but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father,
1|confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word
1|of honor, was terrible.
1|
1|At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after
1|returning from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round
1|the clavichord. As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that
1|poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the Rostov household that
1|winter and, now after Dolokhov's proposal and Iogel's ball, seemed
1|to have grown thicker round Sonya and Natasha as the air does before a
1|thunderstorm. Sonya and Natasha, in the light-blue dresses they had
1|worn at the theater, looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing
1|by the clavichord, happy and smiling. Vera was playing chess with
1|Shinshin in the drawing room. The old countess, waiting for the return
1|of her husband and son, sat playing patience with the old
1|gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, with sparkling eyes and
1|ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short
1|fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang, with
1|his small, husky, but true voice, some verses called "Enchantress,"
1|which he had composed, and to which he was trying to fit music:
1|
1|   Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre
1|   What magic power is this recalls me still?
1|   What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,
1|   What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?
1|
1|He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his
1|sparkling black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natasha.
1|
1|"Splendid! Excellent!" exclaimed Natasha. "Another verse," she
1|said, without noticing Nicholas.
1|
1|"Everything's still the same with them," thought Nicholas,
1|glancing into the drawing room, where he saw Vera and his mother
1|with the old lady.
1|
1|"Ah, and here's Nicholas!" cried Natasha, running up to him.
1|
1|"Is Papa at home?" he asked.
1|
1|"I am so glad you've come!" said Natasha, without answering him. "We
1|are enjoying ourselves! Vasili Dmitrich is staying a day longer for my
1|sake! Did you know?"
1|
1|"No, Papa is not back yet," said Sonya.
1|
1|"Nicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!" called the old
1|countess from the drawing room.
1|
1|Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently
1|at her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the
1|dancing room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to
1|persuade Natasha to sing.
1|
1|"All wight! All wight!" shouted Denisov. "It's no good making
1|excuses now! It's your turn to sing the ba'cawolla--I entweat you!"
1|
1|The countess glanced at her silent son.
1|
1|"What is the matter?" she asked.
1|
1|"Oh, nothing," said he, as if weary of being continually asked the
1|same question. "Will Papa be back soon?"
1|
1|"I expect so."
1|
1|"Everything's the same with them. They know nothing about it!
1|Where am I to go?" thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing
1|room where the clavichord stood.
1|
1|Sonya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to
1|Denisov's favorite barcarolle. Natasha was preparing to sing.
1|Denisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.
1|
1|Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.
1|
1|"Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There's
1|nothing to be happy about!" thought he.
1|
1|Sonya struck the first chord of the prelude.
1|
1|"My God, I'm a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my
1|brain is the only thing left me--not singing!" his thoughts ran on.
1|"Go away? But where to? It's one--let them sing!"
1|
1|He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denisov and the
1|girls and avoiding their eyes.
1|
1|"Nikolenka, what is the matter?" Sonya's eyes fixed on him seemed to
1|ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.
1|
1|Nicholas turned away from her. Natasha too, with her quick instinct,
1|had instantly noticed her brother's condition. But, though she noticed
1|it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from
1|sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself
1|as young people often do. "No, I am too happy now to spoil my
1|enjoyment by sympathy with anyone's sorrow," she felt, and she said to
1|herself: "No, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as
1|I am."
1|
1|"Now, Sonya!" she said, going to the very middle of the room,
1|where she considered the resonance was best.
1|
1|Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as
1|ballet dancers do, Natasha, rising energetically from her heels to her
1|toes, stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.
1|
1|"Yes, that's me!" she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with
1|which Denisov followed her.
1|
1|"And what is she so pleased about?" thought Nicholas, looking at his
1|sister. "Why isn't she dull and ashamed?"
1|
1|Natasha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose, her
1|eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her
1|surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
1|produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which
1|leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
1|you and make you weep.
1|
1|Natasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing
1|seriously, mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing. She
1|no longer sang as a child, there was no longer in her singing that
1|comical, childish, painstaking effect that had been in it before;
1|but she did not yet sing well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her
1|said: "It is not trained, but it is a beautiful voice that must be
1|trained." Only they generally said this some time after she had
1|finished singing. While that untrained voice, with its incorrect
1|breathing and labored transitions, was sounding, even the connoisseurs
1|said nothing, but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again. In
1|her voice there was a virginal freshness, an unconsciousness of her
1|own powers, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, which so mingled
1|with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that
1|voice could be altered without spoiling it.
1|
1|"What is this?" thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely
1|opened eyes. "What has happened to her? How she is singing today!" And
1|suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the
1|next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided
1|into three beats: "Oh mio crudele affetto."... One, two, three... one,
1|two, three... One... "Oh mio crudele affetto."... One, two, three...
1|One. "Oh, this senseless life of ours!" thought Nicholas. "All this
1|misery, and money, and Dolokhov, and anger, and honor--it's all
1|nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natasha, now then, dearest!
1|Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She's taken it! Thank
1|God!" And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si
1|he sung a second, a third below the high note. "Ah, God! How fine! Did
1|I really take it? How fortunate!" he thought.
1|
1|Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was
1|finest in Rostov's soul! And this something was apart from
1|everything else in the world and above everything in the world.
1|"What were losses, and Dolokhov, and words of honor?... All
1|nonsense! One might kill and rob and yet be happy..."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|It was long since Rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he
1|did that day. But no sooner had Natasha finished her barcarolle than
1|reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and
1|went downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old
1|count came in from his Club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing
1|him drive up, went to meet him.
1|
1|"Well--had a good time?" said the old count, smiling gaily and
1|proudly at his son.
1|
1|Nicholas tried to say "Yes," but could not: and he nearly burst into
1|sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son's
1|condition.
1|
1|"Ah, it can't be avoided!" thought Nicholas, for the first and
1|last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him
1|feel ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his
1|father to let him have the carriage to drive to town:
1|
1|"Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting.
1|I need some money."
1|
1|"Dear me!" said his father, who was in a specially good humor. "I
1|told you it would not be enough. How much?"
1|
1|"Very much," said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless
1|smile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, "I have lost a
1|little, I mean a good deal, a great deal--forty three thousand."
1|
1|"What! To whom?... Nonsense!" cried the count, suddenly reddening
1|with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.
1|
1|"I promised to pay tomorrow," said Nicholas.
1|
1|"Well!..." said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking
1|helplessly on the sofa.
1|
1|"It can't be helped It happens to everyone!" said the son, with a
1|bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as
1|a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his
1|crime. He longed to kiss his father's hands and kneel to beg his
1|forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it
1|happens to everyone!
1|
1|The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son's words and
1|began bustlingly searching for something.
1|
1|"Yes, yes," he muttered, "it will be difficult, I fear, difficult to
1|raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?"
1|
1|And with a furtive glance at his son's face, the count went out of
1|the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at
1|all expected this.
1|
1|"Papa! Pa-pa!" he called after him, sobbing, "forgive me!" And
1|seizing his father's hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into
1|tears.
1|
1|While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and
1|daughter were having one not less important. Natasha came running to
1|her mother, quite excited.
1|
1|"Mamma!... Mamma!... He has made me..."
1|
1|"Made what?"
1|
1|"Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!" she exclaimed.
1|
1|The countess did not believe her ears. Denisov had proposed. To
1|whom? To this chit of a girl, Natasha, who not so long ago was playing
1|with dolls and who was still having lessons.
1|
1|"Don't, Natasha! What nonsense!" she said, hoping it was a joke.
1|
1|"Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact," said Natasha
1|indignantly. "I come to ask you what to do, and you call it
1|'nonsense!'"
1|
1|The countess shrugged her shoulders.
1|
1|"If it is true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal, tell him
1|he is a fool, that's all!"
1|
1|"No, he's not a fool!" replied Natasha indignantly and seriously.
1|
1|"Well then, what do you want? You're all in love nowadays. Well,
1|if you are in love, marry him!" said the countess, with a laugh of
1|annoyance. "Good luck to you!"
1|
1|"No, Mamma, I'm not in love with him, I suppose I'm not in love with
1|him."
1|
1|"Well then, tell him so."
1|
1|"Mamma, are you cross? Don't be cross, dear! Is it my fault?"
1|
1|"No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?"
1|said the countess smiling.
1|
1|"No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It's all very
1|well for you," said Natasha, with a responsive smile. "You should have
1|seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came out
1|accidently."
1|
1|"Well, all the same, you must refuse him."
1|
1|"No, I mustn't. I am so sorry for him! He's so nice."
1|
1|"Well then, accept his offer. It's high time for you to be married,"
1|answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.
1|
1|"No, Mamma, but I'm so sorry for him. I don't know how I'm to say
1|it."
1|
1|"And there's nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,"
1|said the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this
1|little Natasha as grown up.
1|
1|"No, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you'll listen
1|at the door," and Natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing
1|hall, where Denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord
1|with his face in his hands.
1|
1|He jumped up at the sound of her light step.
1|
1|"Nataly," he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, "decide my
1|fate. It is in your hands."
1|
1|"Vasili Dmitrich, I'm so sorry for you!... No, but you are so
1|nice... but it won't do...not that... but as a friend, I shall
1|always love you."
1|
1|Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did
1|not understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this
1|instant, they heard the quick rustle of the countess' dress. She
1|came up to them.
1|
1|"Vasili Dmitrich, I thank you for the honor," she said, with an
1|embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denisov--"but my
1|daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son's friend, you
1|would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would
1|not have obliged me to give this refusal."
1|
1|"Countess..." said Denisov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face. He
1|tried to say more, but faltered.
1|
1|Natasha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She
1|began to sob aloud.
1|
1|"Countess, I have done w'ong," Denisov went on in an unsteady voice,
1|"but believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I
1|would give my life twice over..." He looked at the countess, and
1|seeing her severe face said: "Well, good-by, Countess," and kissing
1|her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without
1|looking at Natasha.
1|
1|
1|Next day Rostov saw Denisov off. He did not wish to stay another day
1|in Moscow. All Denisov's Moscow friends gave him a farewell
1|entertainment at the gypsies', with the result that he had no
1|recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three
1|stages of his journey.
1|
1|After Denisov's departure, Rostov spent another fortnight in Moscow,
1|without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could
1|not at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls' room.
1|
1|Sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she
1|wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
1|love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
1|her.
1|
1|He filled the girls' albums with verses and music, and having at
1|last sent Dolokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and
1|received his receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking
1|leave of any of his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which
1|was already in Poland.

1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the
1|Torzhok post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster
1|would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,
1|he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big
1|feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.
1|
1|"Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and
1|tea?" asked his valet.
1|
1|Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had
1|begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
1|question--one so important that he took no notice of what went on
1|around him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to
1|Petersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at
1|this station, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it
1|was a matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours
1|or for the rest of his life.
1|
1|The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling
1|Torzhok embroidery came into the room offering their services. Without
1|changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his
1|spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could
1|go on living without having solved the problems that so absorbed
1|him. He had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day
1|he returned from Sokolniki after the duel and had spent that first
1|agonizing, sleepless night. But now, in the solitude of the journey,
1|they seized him with special force. No matter what he thought about,
1|he always returned to these same questions which he could not solve
1|and yet could not cease to ask himself. It was as if the thread of the
1|chief screw which held his life together were stripped, so that the
1|screw could not get in or out, but went on turning uselessly in the
1|same place.
1|
1|The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his
1|excellency to wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let
1|his excellency have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying
1|and only wanted to get more money from the traveler.
1|
1|"Is this good or bad?" Pierre asked himself. "It is good for me, bad
1|for another traveler, and for himself it's unavoidable, because he
1|needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a
1|thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses.
1|But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as
1|possible. And I," continued Pierre, "shot Dolokhov because I
1|considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they
1|considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who
1|executed him--also for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What
1|should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am
1|I? What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?"
1|
1|There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and
1|that not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer
1|was: "You'll die and all will end. You'll die and know all, or cease
1|asking." But dying was also dreadful.
1|
1|The Torzhok peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering
1|her wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. "I have hundreds of
1|rubles I don't know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered
1|cloak looking timidly at me," he thought. "And what does she want
1|the money for? As if that money could add a hair's breadth to
1|happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me
1|less a prey to evil and death?--death which ends all and must come
1|today or tomorrow--at any rate, in an instant as compared with
1|eternity." And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,
1|and again it turned uselessly in the same place.
1|
1|His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters,
1|by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
1|struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. "And why did she resist her
1|seducer when she loved him?" he thought. "God could not have put
1|into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife--as she
1|once was--did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has
1|been found out, nothing discovered," Pierre again said to himself.
1|"All we can know is that we know nothing. And that's the height of
1|human wisdom."
1|
1|Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and
1|repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre
1|found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.
1|
1|"I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
1|gentleman," said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another
1|traveler, also detained for lack of horses.
1|
1|The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old
1|man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
1|grayish color.
1|
1|Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a
1|bed that had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the
1|newcomer, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off
1|his wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With
1|a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn,
1|nankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa,
1|leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped
1|hair, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, shrewd, and penetrating
1|expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to
1|the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a
1|question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His
1|shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them
1|Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
1|death's head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as
1|it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant
1|was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,
1|evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never
1|grown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler's canteen
1|and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything
1|was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled
1|a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to
1|whom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the
1|need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with
1|this stranger.
1|
1|The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down,* with an
1|unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be
1|wanted.
1|
1|
1|*To indicate he did not want more tea.
1|
1|
1|"No. Give me the book," said the stranger.
1|
1|The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional
1|work, and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him.
1|All at once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and
1|again, leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his
1|former position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not
1|time to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady
1|and severe gaze straight on Pierre's face.
1|
1|Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright
1|old eyes attracted him irresistibly.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|"I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov, if I am not
1|mistaken," said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.
1|
1|Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.
1|
1|"I have heard of you, my dear sir," continued the stranger, "and
1|of your misfortune." He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to
1|say--"Yes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what
1|happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune."--"I regret it very
1|much, my dear sir."
1|
1|Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed,
1|bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.
1|
1|"I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but
1|for greater reasons."
1|
1|He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa
1|by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt
1|reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but,
1|submitting to him involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.
1|
1|"You are unhappy, my dear sir," the stranger continued. "You are
1|young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my
1|power."
1|
1|"Oh, yes!" said Pierre, with a forced smile. "I am very grateful
1|to you. Where are you traveling from?"
1|
1|The stranger's face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but
1|in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
1|irresistibly attractive to Pierre.
1|
1|"But if for reason you don't feel inclined to talk to me," said
1|the old man, "say so, my dear sir." And he suddenly smiled, in an
1|unexpected and tenderly paternal way.
1|
1|"Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your
1|acquaintance," said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger's
1|hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull--a Masonic
1|sign.
1|
1|"Allow me to ask," he said, "are you a Mason?"
1|
1|"Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons," said the
1|stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre's eyes. "And in
1|their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you."
1|
1|"I am afraid," said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the
1|confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his
1|own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs--"I am afraid I am very
1|far from understanding--how am I to put it?--I am afraid my way of
1|looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not
1|understand one another."
1|
1|"I know your outlook," said the Mason, "and the view of life you
1|mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,
1|is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit
1|of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if
1|I had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of
1|life is a regrettable delusion."
1|
1|"Just as I may suppose you to be deluded," said Pierre, with a faint
1|smile.
1|
1|"I should never dare to say that I know the truth," said the
1|Mason, whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision
1|and firmness. "No one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying
1|stone on stone with the cooperation of all, by the millions of
1|generations from our forefather Adam to our own times, is that
1|temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great
1|God," he added, and closed his eyes.
1|
1|"I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in God,"
1|said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to
1|speak the whole truth.
1|
1|The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with
1|millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he,
1|poor man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.
1|
1|"Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir," said the Mason. "You cannot
1|know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, I am unhappy," assented Pierre. "But what am I to do?"
1|
1|"You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You
1|do not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He
1|is in thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just
1|uttered!" pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.
1|
1|He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.
1|
1|"If He were not," he said quietly, "you and I would not be speaking of
1|Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou
1|denied?" he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in
1|his voice. "Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy
1|conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst
1|thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence
1|of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and
1|infinite in all His attributes?..."
1|
1|He stopped and remained silent for a long time.
1|
1|Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.
1|
1|"He exists, but to understand Him is hard," the Mason began again,
1|looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the
1|leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could
1|not keep still. "If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I
1|could bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to
1|thee. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence,
1|His infinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts
1|his eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or
1|understand his own vileness and sinfulness?" He paused again. "Who art
1|thou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter
1|those blasphemous words," he went on, with a somber and scornful
1|smile. "And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little
1|child, who, playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch, dares
1|to say that, as he does not understand its use, he does not believe in
1|the master who made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, from our
1|forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to attain that knowledge
1|and are still infinitely far from our aim; but in our lack of
1|understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness...."
1|
1|Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason's face
1|with shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but
1|believing with his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he
1|accepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason's words, or
1|believed as a child believes, in the speaker's tone of conviction
1|and earnestness, or the tremor of the speaker's voice--which sometimes
1|almost broke--or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this
1|conviction, or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation,
1|which radiated from his whole being (and which struck Pierre
1|especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness)--at
1|any rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did
1|believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration, and
1|return to life.
1|
1|"He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life," said the
1|Mason.
1|
1|"I do not understand," said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts
1|reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness,
1|in the Mason's arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.
1|"I don't understand," he said, "how it is that the mind of man
1|cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak."
1|
1|The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.
1|
1|"The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish
1|to imbibe," he said. "Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure
1|vessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of
1|myself can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, that is so," said Pierre joyfully.
1|
1|"The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those
1|worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into
1|which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.
1|The highest wisdom has but one science--the science of the whole--the
1|science explaining the whole creation and man's place in it. To
1|receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one's inner
1|self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to
1|perfect one's self. And to attain this end, we have the light called
1|conscience that God has implanted in our souls."
1|
1|"Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
1|
1|"Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask
1|thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained
1|relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich,
1|you are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all
1|these good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?"
1|
1|"No, I hate my life," Pierre muttered, wincing.
1|
1|"Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art
1|purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How
1|have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving
1|everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have
1|become the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you
1|done for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of
1|thousands of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally?
1|No! You have profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is
1|what you have done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of
1|service to your neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness.
1|Then you married, my dear sir--took on yourself responsibility for the
1|guidance of a young woman; and what have you done? You have not helped
1|her to find the way of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an
1|abyss of deceit and misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and
1|you say you do not know God and hate your life. There is nothing
1|strange in that, my dear sir!"
1|
1|After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse,
1|again leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes.
1|Pierre looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face
1|and moved his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, "Yes, a
1|vile, idle, vicious life!" but dared not break the silence.
1|
1|The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called
1|his servant.
1|
1|"How about the horses?" he asked, without looking at Pierre.
1|
1|"The exchange horses have just come," answered the servant. "Will
1|you not rest here?"
1|
1|"No, tell them to harness."
1|
1|"Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
1|all, and without promising to help me?" thought Pierre, rising with
1|downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at
1|the Mason. "Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a
1|contemptible and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not
1|want to," thought Pierre. "But this man knows the truth and, if he
1|wished to, could disclose it to me."
1|
1|Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The
1|traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began
1|fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bezukhov, and
1|said in a tone of indifferent politeness:
1|
1|"Where are you going to now, my dear sir?"
1|
1|"I?... I'm going to Petersburg," answered Pierre, in a childlike,
1|hesitating voice. "I thank you. I agree with all you have said. But do
1|not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what
1|you would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it
1|is I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me,
1|and perhaps I may..."
1|
1|Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.
1|
1|The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.
1|
1|"Help comes from God alone," he said, "but such measure of help as
1|our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to
1|Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski" (he took out his notebook
1|and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).
1|"Allow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital,
1|first of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and
1|do not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good
1|journey, my dear sir," he added, seeing that his servant had
1|entered... "and success."
1|
1|The traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre saw from the
1|postmaster's book. Bazdeev had been one of the best-known Freemasons
1|and Martinists, even in Novikov's time. For a long while after he
1|had gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and
1|down the room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous
1|sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful,
1|irreproachable, virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It
1|seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow
1|forgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not a trace of his former
1|doubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed in the possibility
1|of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one
1|another in the path of virtue, and that is how Freemasonry presented
1|itself to him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his
1|arrival, he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas a
1|Kempis, whose book had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing
1|he continually realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto
1|unknown to him, of believing in the possibility of attaining
1|perfection, and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men,
1|which Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to him. A week after his arrival,
1|the young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in
1|Petersburg society, came into his room one evening in the official and
1|ceremonious manner in which Dolokhov's second had called on him,
1|and, having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that
1|there was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre.
1|
1|"I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count," he said
1|without sitting down. "A person of very high standing in our
1|Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order
1|before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I
1|consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person's wishes. Do you wish
1|to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?"
1|
1|The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always
1|before met at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most
1|brilliant women, surprised Pierre.
1|
1|"Yes, I do wish it," said he.
1|
1|Willarski bowed his head.
1|
1|"One more question, Count," he said, "which I beg you to answer in all
1|sincerity--not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you
1|renounced your former convictions--do you believe in God?"
1|
1|Pierre considered.
1|
1|"Yes... yes, I believe in God," he said.
1|
1|"In that case..." began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.
1|
1|"Yes, I do believe in God," he repeated.
1|
1|"In that case we can go," said Willarski. "My carriage is at your
1|service."
1|
1|Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre's inquiries
1|as to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied
1|that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had
1|only to tell the truth.
1|
1|Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had
1|its headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a
1|small well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the
1|aid of a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in
1|strange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him,
1|said something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to
1|a small wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never
1|seen before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski
1|bound Pierre's eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching
1|some hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed
1|him, and taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the
1|knot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a
1|shamefaced smile. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a
1|puckered, though smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain,
1|timid steps.
1|
1|Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.
1|
1|"Whatever happens to you," he said, "you must bear it all manfully
1|if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood." (Pierre nodded
1|affirmatively.) "When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover
1|your eyes," added Willarski. "I wish you courage and success," and,
1|pressing Pierre's hand, he went out.
1|
1|Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice he
1|shrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to
1|take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his
1|eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs
1|almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He
1|experienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of
1|what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He
1|felt curious to know what was going to happen and what would be
1|revealed to him; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had
1|come when he would at last start on that path of regeneration and on
1|the actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he
1|met Joseph Alexeevich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took
1|the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black
1|darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre
1|went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which
1|lay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with
1|the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth. After
1|reading the first words of the Gospel: "In the beginning was the
1|Word and the Word was with God," Pierre went round the table and saw a
1|large open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones
1|inside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on
1|an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, he expected
1|everything to be unusual, even more unusual than what he was seeing. A
1|skull, a coffin, the Gospel--it seemed to him that he had expected all
1|this and even more. Trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around.
1|"God, death, love, the brotherhood of man," he kept saying to himself,
1|associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened
1|and someone came in.
1|
1|By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed,
1|he saw rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the
1|darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the
1|table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.
1|
1|This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his
1|chest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which
1|rose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit
1|up from below.
1|
1|"For what have you come hither?" asked the newcomer, turning in
1|Pierre's direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. "Why have
1|you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not
1|seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,
1|enlightenment?"
1|
1|At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre
1|felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his
1|boyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially
1|a complete stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man.
1|With bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by
1|which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the
1|Brotherhood was known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor
1|a man he knew, Smolyaninov, and it mortified him to think that the
1|newcomer was an acquaintance--he wished him simply a brother and a
1|virtuous instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so
1|that the Rhetor had to repeat his question.
1|
1|"Yes... I... I... desire regeneration," Pierre uttered with
1|difficulty.
1|
1|"Very well," said Smolyaninov, and went on at once: "Have you any
1|idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach
1|your aim?" said he quietly and quickly.
1|
1|"I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration," said Pierre,
1|with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
1|excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
1|Russian.
1|
1|"What is your conception of Freemasonry?"
1|
1|"I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men
1|who have virtuous aims," said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the
1|inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he
1|spoke. "I imagine..."
1|
1|"Good!" said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this
1|answer. "Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?"
1|
1|"No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it," said
1|Pierre, so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him
1|what he was saying. "I have been an atheist," answered Pierre.
1|
1|"You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,
1|therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?" said the
1|Rhetor, after a moment's pause.
1|
1|"Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
1|
1|The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his
1|breast, and began to speak.
1|
1|"Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order," he said,
1|"and if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood
1|with profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation
1|on which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the
1|preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important
1|mystery... which has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from
1|the first man--a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends.
1|But since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use
1|it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not
1|everyone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim,
1|that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their
1|hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to
1|us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery,
1|and thereby to render them capable of receiving it.
1|
1|"By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to
1|improve the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of
1|piety and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the
1|evil which sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you
1|again."
1|
1|"To combat the evil which sways the world..." Pierre repeated, and a
1|mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his
1|mind. He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and
1|he addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself
1|vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and
1|deed, imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the
1|three objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving
1|mankind, especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery
1|mentioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem
1|to him essential, and the second aim, that of purifying and
1|regenerating himself, did not much interest him because at that moment
1|he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former
1|faults and was ready for all that was good.
1|
1|Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of
1|the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon's
1|temple, which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These
1|virtues were:  1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order.
1| 2. Obedience to those of higher ranks in the Order.  3. Morality.  4.
1|Love of mankind.  5. Courage.  6. Generosity.  7. The love of death.
1|
1|"In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death," the
1|Rhetor said, "to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but
1|as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue
1|from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense
1|and peace."
1|
1|"Yes, that must be so," thought Pierre, when after these words the
1|Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. "It must be
1|so, but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which
1|is only now gradually opening before me." But five of the other
1|virtues which Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt
1|already in his soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind,
1|and especially obedience--which did not even seem to him a virtue, but
1|a joy. (He now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to
1|submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot
1|what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it.
1|
1|The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre
1|whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
1|all that would be required of him.
1|
1|"I am ready for everything," said Pierre.
1|
1|"I must also inform you," said the Rhetor, "that our Order
1|delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which
1|may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after
1|wisdom and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see
1|therein should already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere,
1|more than words could do. You will perhaps also see in your further
1|initiation a like method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the
1|ancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A
1|hieroglyph," said the Rhetor, "is an emblem of something not
1|cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling
1|those of the symbol."
1|
1|Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He
1|listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his
1|ordeal was about to begin.
1|
1|"If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation," said the Rhetor
1|coming closer to Pierre. "In token of generosity I ask you to give
1|me all your valuables."
1|
1|"But I have nothing here," replied Pierre, supposing that he was
1|asked to give up all he possessed.
1|
1|"What you have with you: watch, money, rings...."
1|
1|Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage
1|for some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that
1|had been done, the Rhetor said:
1|
1|"In token of obedience, I ask you to undress."
1|
1|Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to
1|the Rhetor's instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre's
1|left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his
1|trousers to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his
1|right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save
1|this stranger the trouble, but the Mason told him that was not
1|necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike
1|smile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on
1|his face against his will, Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and
1|legs apart, before his brother Rhetor, and awaited his further
1|commands.
1|
1|"And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief
1|passion," said the latter.
1|
1|"My passion! I have had so many," replied Pierre.
1|
1|"That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on
1|the path of virtue," said the Mason.
1|
1|Pierre paused, seeking a reply.
1|
1|"Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?" He
1|went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to
1|give the pre-eminence.
1|
1|"Women," he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.
1|
1|The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
1|answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that
1|lay on the table, again bound his eyes.
1|
1|"For the last time I say to you--turn all your attention upon
1|yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in
1|passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not
1|without us but within...."
1|
1|Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing
1|source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.
1|

1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre,
1|not the Rhetor but Pierre's sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized
1|by his voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his
1|resolution Pierre replied: "Yes, yes, I agree," and with a beaming,
1|childlike smile, his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and
1|timidly in one slippered and one booted foot, he advanced, while
1|Willarski held a sword to his bare chest. He was conducted from that
1|room along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was at last
1|brought to the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was
1|answered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors opened before
1|them. A bass voice (Pierre was still blindfolded) questioned him as to
1|who he was, when and where he was born, and so on. Then he was again
1|led somewhere still blindfolded, and as they went along he was told
1|allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of
1|the Eternal Architect of the universe, and of the courage with which
1|he should endure toils and dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre
1|noticed that he was spoken of now as the "Seeker," now as the
1|"Sufferer," and now as the "Postulant," to the accompaniment of
1|various knockings with mallets and swords. As he was being led up to
1|some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his
1|conductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of
1|them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet. After
1|that they took his right hand, placed it on something, and told him to
1|hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to
1|repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of
1|the Order. The candles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted,
1|as Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told that he would now see the
1|lesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint
1|light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men
1|standing before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor's and holding
1|swords in their hands pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man
1|whose white shirt was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved
1|forward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce
1|it. But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once
1|blindfolded again.
1|
1|"Now thou hast seen the lesser light," uttered a voice. Then the
1|candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light;
1|the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said
1|together: "Sic transit gloria mundi."
1|
1|Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the
1|room and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black
1|sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some
1|of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President's chair
1|sat a young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from
1|his neck. On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre had met at
1|Anna Pavlovna's two years before. There were also present a very
1|distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the
1|Kuragins'. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words
1|of the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was
1|a star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet
1|with various figures worked upon it, at the other was something
1|resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it
1|stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the
1|brothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right
1|angles, and bade him lie down, saying that he must prostrate himself
1|at the Gates of the Temple.
1|
1|"He must first receive the trowel," whispered one of the brothers.
1|
1|"Oh, hush, please!" said another.
1|
1|Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
1|obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. "Where am I? What am I
1|doing? Aren't they laughing at me? Shan't I be ashamed to remember
1|this?" But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the
1|serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone
1|through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast at
1|his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,
1|prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the
1|feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before.
1|When he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white
1|leather apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a
1|trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master
1|addressed him. He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain
1|the whiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength and purity;
1|then of the unexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse
1|his own heart from vice, and indulgently to smooth with it the heart
1|of his neighbor. As to the first pair of gloves, a man's, he said that
1|Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them. The second
1|pair of man's gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of
1|the third, a pair of women's gloves, he said: "Dear brother, these
1|woman's gloves are intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom
1|you shall honor most of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity
1|of heart to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in
1|Masonry." And after a pause, he added: "But beware, dear brother, that
1|these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean." While the Grand
1|Master said these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew
1|embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more confused, blushed like a
1|child till tears came to his eyes, began looking about him uneasily,
1|and an awkward pause followed.
1|
1|This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to
1|the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation
1|of all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a
1|trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows,
1|and so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs
1|of the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit
1|down. The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very
1|long, and Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a
1|state to understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the
1|last words of the statutes and these remained in his mind.
1|
1|"In our temples we recognize no other distinctions," read the
1|Grand Master, "but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any
1|distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother's aid
1|whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that
1|falleth, never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and
1|courteous. Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy
1|happiness with thy neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that
1|bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him
1|good. Thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of
1|the ancient dignity which thou hast lost."
1|
1|He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with
1|tears of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to
1|answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met
1|him on all sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all
1|these men only brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work
1|with them.
1|
1|The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down
1|in their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the
1|necessity of humility.
1|
1|The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed,
1|and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of "Collector of
1|Alms" went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to
1|subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride
1|subscribed the same amount as the others.
1|
1|The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he
1|had returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of
1|years, had become completely changed, and had quite left behind his
1|former habits and way of life.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was
1|sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance
1|of the Square, one side of which symbolized God, another moral things,
1|a third physical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now
1|and then his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he
1|formed in imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at
1|the Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the
1|Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre
1|proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to
1|the welfare of his serfs. He was joyfully planning this new life, when
1|Prince Vasili suddenly entered the room.
1|
1|"My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you
1|quarreled with Helene, mon cher? You are under a delusion," said
1|Prince Vasili, as he entered. "I know all about it, and I can tell you
1|positively that Helene is as innocent before you as Christ was
1|before the Jews."
1|
1|Pierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasili interrupted him.
1|
1|"And why didn't you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I
1|know all about it and understand it all," he said. "You behaved as
1|becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won't go
1|into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her
1|and me in the eyes of society, and even of the court," he added,
1|lowering his voice. "She is living in Moscow and you are here.
1|Remember, dear boy," and he drew Pierre's arm downwards, "it is simply
1|a misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her
1|a letter at once, and she'll come here and all will be explained, or
1|else, my dear boy, let me tell you it's quite likely you'll have to
1|suffer for it."
1|
1|Prince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look.
1|
1|"I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a
1|keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to
1|Helene."
1|
1|Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vasili
1|did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to
1|speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he
1|had firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words
1|of the Masonic statutes, "be kindly and courteous," recurred to him.
1|He blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with
1|himself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life--to
1|say an unpleasant thing to a man's face, to say what the other,
1|whoever he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to
1|Prince Vasili's tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he
1|would be unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what
1|he said now his future depended--whether he would follow the same
1|old road, or that new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on
1|which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life.
1|
1|"Now, dear boy," said Prince Vasili playfully, "say 'yes,' and
1|I'll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf."
1|
1|But before Prince Vasili had finished his playful speech, Pierre,
1|without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his
1|father, muttered in a whisper:
1|
1|"Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!" And he jumped up
1|and opened the door for him.
1|
1|"Go!" he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
1|confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasili's face.
1|
1|"What's the matter with you? Are you ill?"
1|
1|"Go!" the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasili had to go
1|without receiving any explanation.
1|
1|A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the
1|Masons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went
1|away to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and
1|Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new
1|activity.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|The duel between Pierre and Dolokhov was hushed up and, in spite
1|of the Emperor's severity regarding duels at that time, neither the
1|principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the
1|duel, confirmed by Pierre's rupture with his wife, was the talk of
1|society. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension
1|when he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was
1|the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society
1|after his marriage--when the marriageable daughters and their
1|mothers had nothing to hope from him--especially as he did not know
1|how, and did not wish, to court society's favor. Now he alone was
1|blamed for what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and
1|subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after
1|Pierre's departure Helene returned to Petersburg, she was received
1|by all her acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade
1|of deference due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her
1|husband Helene assumed a dignified expression, which with
1|characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its
1|significance. This expression suggested that she had resolved to
1|endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross
1|laid upon her by God. Prince Vasili expressed his opinion more openly.
1|He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and, pointing to
1|his forehead, remarked:
1|
1|"A bit touched--I always said so."
1|
1|"I said from the first," declared Anna Pavlovna referring to Pierre,
1|"I said at the time and before anyone else" (she insisted on her
1|priority) "that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved
1|ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody was
1|in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and
1|when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my
1|soirees. And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then
1|and foretold all that has happened."
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
1|soirees as before--such as she alone had the gift of arranging--at
1|which was to be found "the cream of really good society, the bloom
1|of the intellectual essence of Petersburg," as she herself put it.
1|Besides this refined selection of society Anna Pavlovna's receptions
1|were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new
1|and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the
1|state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court
1|society so dearly and distinctly indicated.
1|
1|Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon's
1|destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the
1|surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when
1|our troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with
1|Napoleon was beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one of her soirees. The
1|"cream of really good society" consisted of the fascinating Helene,
1|forsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte
1|who had just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a
1|young man referred to in that drawing room as "a man of great merit"
1|(un homme de beaucoup de merite), a newly appointed maid of honor
1|and her mother, and several other less noteworthy persons.
1|
1|The novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening
1|was Boris Drubetskoy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from
1|the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.
1|
1|The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company
1|that evening was this:
1|
1|"Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to
1|countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance
1|and mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not
1|cease to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say
1|to the King of Prussia and others: 'So much the worse for you. Tu l'as
1|voulu, George Dandin,' that's all we have to say about it!"
1|
1|When Boris, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the
1|drawing room, almost all the company had assembled, and the
1|conversation, guided by Anna Pavlovna, was about our diplomatic
1|relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her.
1|
1|Boris, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and
1|self-possessed, entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the
1|uniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his
1|respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him
1|to several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered
1|description of each.
1|
1|"Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, M. Krug, the charge d'affaires from
1|Copenhagen--a profound intellect," and simply, "Mr. Shitov--a
1|man of great merit"--this of the man usually so described.
1|
1|Thanks to Anna Mikhaylovna's efforts, his own tastes, and the
1|peculiarities of his reserved nature, Boris had managed during his
1|service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a
1|very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to
1|Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He
1|had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which
1|he had been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign
1|might rank incomparably higher than a general, and according to
1|which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or
1|work, or courage, or perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to
1|get on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself often
1|surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of
1|others to understand these things. In consequence of this discovery
1|his whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends, all
1|his plans for his future, were completely altered. He was not rich,
1|but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others, and
1|would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to
1|be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in
1|an old uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of
1|only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use
1|to him. He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of
1|the Rostovs' house and of his childish love for Natasha was unpleasant
1|to him and he had not once been to see the Rostovs since the day of
1|his departure for the army. To be in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room he
1|considered an important step up in the service, and he at once
1|understood his role, letting his hostess make use of whatever interest
1|he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each face, appraising
1|the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of those present,
1|and the advantages that might accrue. He took the seat indicated to
1|him beside the fair Helene and listened to the general conversation.
1|
1|"Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable
1|that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure
1|them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the
1|actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet," said the Danish charge
1|d'affaires.
1|
1|"The doubt is flattering," said "the man of profound intellect,"
1|with a subtle smile.
1|
1|"We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of
1|Austria," said Mortemart. "The Emperor of Austria can never have
1|thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it."
1|
1|"Ah, my dear vicomte," put in Anna Pavlovna, "L'Urope" (for some
1|reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined
1|French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing
1|with a Frenchman), "L'Urope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere."*
1|
1|
1|*"Europe will never be our sincere ally."
1|
1|
1|After that Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the
1|King of Prussia, in order to draw Boris into the conversation.
1|
1|Boris listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his
1|turn, but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his
1|neighbor, the beautiful Helene, whose eyes several times met those
1|of the handsome young aide-de-camp with a smile.
1|
1|Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna very naturally
1|asked Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state
1|he found the Prussian army. Boris, speaking with deliberation, told
1|them in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies
1|and the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of
1|his own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he
1|engrossed the general attention, and Anna Pavlovna felt that the
1|novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her
1|visitors. The greatest attention of all to Boris' narrative was
1|shown by Helene. She asked him several questions about his journey and
1|seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army. As soon
1|as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile.
1|
1|"You absolutely must come and see me," she said in a tone that
1|implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this
1|was absolutely necessary.
1|
1|"On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure."
1|
1|Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a
1|conversation with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away on the
1|pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.
1|
1|"You know her husband, of course?" said Anna Pavlovna, closing her
1|eyes and indicating Helene with a sorrowful gesture. "Ah, she is
1|such an unfortunate and charming woman! Don't mention him before
1|her--please don't! It is too painful for her!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|When Boris and Anna Pavlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte
1|had the ear of the company.
1|
1|Bending forward in his armchair he said: "Le Roi de Prusse!" and
1|having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.
1|
1|"Le Roi de Prusse?" Hippolyte said interrogatively, again
1|laughing, and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna
1|Pavlovna waited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to
1|say no more she began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious
1|Bonaparte had stolen the sword of Frederick the Great.
1|
1|"It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I..." she began, but
1|Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: "Le Roi de Prusse..." and
1|again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and
1|said no more.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte's friend, addressed
1|him firmly.
1|
1|"Come now, what about your Roi de Prusse?"
1|
1|Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.
1|
1|"Oh, it's nothing. I only wished to say..." (he wanted to repeat a
1|joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that
1|evening to get in) "I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight
1|pour le Roi de Prusse!"
1|
1|Boris smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or
1|appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody
1|laughed.
1|
1|"Your joke is too bad, it's witty but unjust," said Anna Pavlovna,
1|shaking her little shriveled finger at him.
1|
1|"We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right
1|principles. Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!" she said.
1|
1|The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on
1|the political news. It became particularly animated toward the end
1|of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were
1|mentioned.
1|
1|"You know N-- N-- received a snuffbox with the portrait last
1|year?" said "the man of profound intellect." "Why shouldn't
1|S-- S-- get the same distinction?"
1|
1|"Pardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor's portrait is a reward but
1|not a distinction," said the diplomatist--"a gift, rather."
1|
1|"There are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg."
1|
1|"It's impossible," replied another.
1|
1|"Will you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter...."
1|
1|When everybody rose to go, Helene who had spoken very little all the
1|evening again turned to Boris, asking him in a tone of caressing
1|significant command to come to her on Tuesday.
1|
1|"It is of great importance to me," she said, turning with a smile
1|toward Anna Pavlovna, and Anna Pavlovna, with the same sad smile
1|with which she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported Helene's
1|wish.
1|
1|It seemed as if from some words Boris had spoken that evening
1|about the Prussian army, Helene had suddenly found it necessary to see
1|him. She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he
1|came on Tuesday.
1|
1|But on Tuesday evening, having come to Helene's splendid salon,
1|Boris received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for
1|him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to
1|him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said
1|unexpectedly and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face:
1|"Come to dinner tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!"
1|
1|During that stay in Petersburg, Boris became an intimate in the
1|countess' house.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier.
1|Everywhere one heard curses on Bonaparte, "the enemy of mankind."
1|Militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and
1|from the seat of war came contradictory news, false as usual and
1|therefore variously interpreted. The life of old Prince Bolkonski,
1|Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.
1|
1|In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
1|then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout
1|Russia. Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly
1|noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed,
1|he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been
1|appointed by the Emperor himself, and this fresh opportunity for
1|action gave him new energy and strength. He was continually
1|traveling through the three provinces entrusted to him, was pedantic
1|in the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruelty with his
1|subordinates, and went into everything down to the minutest details
1|himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from
1|her father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with
1|the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called
1|him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse
1|Savishna in the late princess' rooms and Princess Mary spent most of
1|the day in the nursery, taking a mother's place to her little nephew
1|as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passionately
1|fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give
1|her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel--as she called
1|her nephew--and playing with him.
1|
1|Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over
1|the tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble
1|monument brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread
1|wings ready to fly upwards. The angel's upper lip was slightly
1|raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the
1|chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that
1|the angel's face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But
1|what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing
1|to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to
1|give the angel's face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he
1|had read on the face of his dead wife: "Ah, why have you done this
1|to me?"
1|
1|Soon after Prince Andrew's return the old prince made over to him
1|a large estate, Bogucharovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald
1|Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with
1|Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal
1|to bearing with his father's peculiarities, and partly because he
1|needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo, began building
1|and spent most of his time there.
1|
1|After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved
1|not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and
1|everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the
1|recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his
1|son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old
1|man, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new
1|campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the
1|war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.
1|
1|On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.
1|Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father's
1|absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman
1|who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and
1|letters for Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
1|letters to Princess Mary's apartments, but did not find him there.
1|He was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.
1|
1|"If you please, your excellency, Petrusha has brought some
1|papers," said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting
1|on a child's little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he
1|poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of
1|water.
1|
1|"What is it?" he said crossly, and, his hand shaking
1|unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the
1|mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought
1|it.
1|
1|There were in the room a child's cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a
1|table, a child's table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew
1|was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was
1|burning on the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light
1|did not fall on the cot.
1|
1|"My dear," said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside
1|the cot where she was standing, "better wait a bit... later..."
1|
1|"Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things
1|off--and this is what comes of it!" said Prince Andrew in an
1|exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.
1|
1|"My dear, really... it's better not to wake him... he's asleep,"
1|said the princess in a tone of entreaty.
1|
1|Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed,
1|wineglass in hand.
1|
1|"Perhaps we'd really better not wake him," he said hesitating.
1|
1|"As you please... really... I think so... but as you please," said
1|Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had
1|prevailed. She drew her brother's attention to the maid who was
1|calling him in a whisper.
1|
1|It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the
1|boy who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their
1|household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town,
1|they had been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by
1|sleeplessness and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one
1|another and reproached and disputed with each other.
1|
1|"Petrusha has come with papers from your father," whispered the
1|maid.
1|
1|Prince Andrew went out.
1|
1|"Devil take them!" he muttered, and after listening to the verbal
1|instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
1|father's letter, he returned to the nursery.
1|
1|"Well?" he asked.
1|
1|"Still the same. Wait, for heaven's sake. Karl Ivanich always says
1|that sleep is more important than anything," whispered Princess Mary
1|with a sigh.
1|
1|Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.
1|
1|"Confound you and your Karl Ivanich!" He took the glass with the
1|drops and again went up to the cot.
1|
1|"Andrew, don't!" said Princess Mary.
1|
1|But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his
1|eyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.
1|
1|"But I wish it," he said. "I beg you--give it him!"
1|
1|Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively
1|and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed
1|hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and
1|sat down on a sofa in the next room.
1|
1|He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them
1|mechanically he began reading. The old prince, now and then using
1|abbreviations, wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as
1|follows:
1|
1|
1|Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful
1|news--if it's not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete
1|victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,
1|and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a
1|German--I congratulate him! I can't make out what the commander at
1|Korchevo--a certain Khandrikov--is up to; till now the additional
1|men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say
1|I'll have his head off if everything is not here in a week. Have
1|received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from
1|Petenka--he took part in it--and it's all true. When mischief-makers
1|don't meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is said to be
1|fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to Korchevo without
1|delay and carry out instructions!
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It
1|was a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin. He folded
1|it up without reading it and reread his father's letter, ending with
1|the words: "Gallop off to Korchevo and carry out instructions!"
1|
1|"No, pardon me, I won't go now till the child is better," thought
1|he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.
1|
1|Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the
1|baby.
1|
1|"Ah yes, and what else did he say that's unpleasant?" thought Prince
1|Andrew, recalling his father's letter. "Yes, we have gained a
1|victory over Bonaparte, just when I'm not serving. Yes, yes, he's
1|always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!" And he began reading
1|Bilibin's letter which was written in French. He read without
1|understanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment,
1|what he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of
1|all else.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and
1|though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,
1|he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and
1|self-derision genuinely Russian. Bilibin wrote that the obligation
1|of diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in
1|Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the
1|bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the
1|army. The letter was old, having been written before the battle at
1|Preussisch-Eylau.
1|
1|"Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz," wrote
1|Bilibin, "as you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I
1|have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for
1|me; what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.
1|
1|"I begin ab ovo. 'The enemy of the human race,' as you know, attacks
1|the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only
1|betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but it
1|turns out that 'the enemy of the human race' pays no heed to our
1|fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the
1|Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had
1|begun, and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and
1|installs himself in the palace at Potsdam.
1|
1|"'I most ardently desire,' writes the King of Prussia to
1|Bonaparte, 'that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my
1|palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as
1|circumstances allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that
1|end. May I have succeeded!' The Prussian generals pride themselves
1|on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first
1|demand.
1|
1|"The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the
1|King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender....
1|All this is absolutely true.
1|
1|"In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude,
1|it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more,
1|in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have
1|everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,
1|a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success
1|might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so
1|young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozorovski and
1|Kamenski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,
1|Suvorov-like, in a kibitka, and is received with acclamations of joy
1|and triumph.
1|
1|"On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails
1|are taken to the field marshal's room, for he likes to do everything
1|himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those
1|meant for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters
1|addressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field
1|marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters
1|from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts
1|into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything,
1|seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those from the Emperor
1|addressed to others. 'Ah! So that's the way they treat me! No
1|confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then!
1|Get along with you!' So he writes the famous order of the day to
1|General Bennigsen:
1|
1|'I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the
1|army. You have brought your army corps to Pultusk, routed: here it
1|is exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done,
1|and, as you yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday, you must
1|think of retreating to our frontier--which do today.'
1|
1|"'From all my riding,' he writes to the Emperor, 'I have got a
1|saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite
1|prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on
1|the command to the general next in seniority, Count Buxhowden,
1|having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising
1|him if there is a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior
1|of Prussia, for only one day's ration of bread remains, and in some
1|regiments none at all, as reported by the division commanders,
1|Ostermann and Sedmoretzki, and all that the peasants had has been
1|eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I
1|recover. In regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the
1|information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another
1|fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring.
1|
1|"'Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is
1|already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great
1|and glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most
1|gracious permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play
1|the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army. My
1|removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir--a blind man
1|has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.'
1|
1|"The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,
1|isn't it logical?
1|
1|"This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly
1|interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal's departure it
1|appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.
1|Buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen
1|does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who
1|are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the
1|opportunity to fight a battle 'on his own hand' as the Germans say. He
1|does so. This is the battle of Pultusk, which is considered a great
1|victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as
1|you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or
1|lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say;
1|and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultusk. In
1|short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg
1|with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from
1|Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory,
1|does not give up the command of the army to General Buxhowden. During
1|this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of
1|maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack
1|the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxhowden who by right of
1|seniority should be our chief. So energetically do we pursue this aim
1|that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to
1|separate ourselves from our enemy, who at the moment is not Bonaparte
1|but Buxhowden. General Buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by
1|a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that
1|enabled us to escape him. Buxhowden pursues us--we scuttle. He hardly
1|crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other. At last
1|our enemy. Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are angry,
1|and the result is a challenge on Buxhowden's part and an epileptic fit
1|on Bennigsen's. But at the critical moment the courier who carried the
1|news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg returns bringing our
1|appointment as commander in chief, and our first foe, Buxhowden, is
1|vanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But
1|as it turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before
1|us--namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread,
1|meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads
1|impassable. The Orthodox begin looting, and in a way of which our last
1|campaign can give you no idea. Half the regiments form bands and scour
1|the countryside and put everything to fire and sword. The inhabitants
1|are totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is
1|everywhere. Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters, and the
1|commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them. During
1|one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my
1|dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of
1|divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear this will
1|oblige one half the army to shoot the other."
1|
1|At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,
1|in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust
1|Bilibin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When
1|he had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away.
1|It was not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life
1|out there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his
1|eyes, rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what
1|he had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly
1|he thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized
1|with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he
1|was reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and
1|opened it.
1|
1|Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from
1|him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the
1|cot.
1|
1|"My dear," he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
1|him.
1|
1|As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was
1|seized by an unreasoning panic--it occurred to him that the child
1|was dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.
1|
1|"All is over," he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his
1|forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find
1|it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the
1|curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could
1|not find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about
1|till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and
1|was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had
1|already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught
1|him, tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The
1|soft forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand;
1|even the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was
1|not dead, but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent.
1|Prince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart,
1|this helpless little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him,
1|gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed
1|under the blanket. He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow
1|appeared under the curtain of the cot. He did not look round, but
1|still gazing at the infant's face listened to his regular breathing.
1|The dark shadow was Princess Mary, who had come up to the cot with
1|noiseless steps, lifted the curtain, and dropped it again behind
1|her. Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his
1|hand to her. She pressed it.
1|
1|"He has perspired," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"I was coming to tell you so."
1|
1|The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his
1|forehead against the pillow.
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain
1|her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy
1|that were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him,
1|slightly catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a
1|warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain
1|as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut
1|off from all the world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away,
1|ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain.
1|
1|"Yes, this is the one thing left me now," he said with a sigh.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went
1|to the Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs,
1|taking with him full directions which he had written down for his
1|own guidance as to what he should do on his estates.
1|
1|When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office
1|and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that
1|steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs--and that till then
1|they were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their
1|babies were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to
1|the serfs, punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and
1|hospitals, asylums, and schools were to be established on all the
1|estates. Some of the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among
1|them) listened with alarm, supposing these words to mean that the
1|young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of
1|money, some after their first fright were amused by Pierre's lisp
1|and the new words they had not heard before, others simply enjoyed
1|hearing how the master talked, while the cleverest among them,
1|including the chief steward, understood from this speech how they
1|could best handle the master for their own ends.
1|
1|The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre's intentions,
1|but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go
1|into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.
1|
1|Despite Count Bezukhov's enormous wealth, since he had come into
1|an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a
1|year, Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him
1|an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the
1|following budget:
1|
1|About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank,
1|about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town
1|house, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was
1|given in pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was
1|sent to the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The
1|building of a new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in
1|each of the last two years, and he did not know how the rest, about
1|100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost every year he was obliged to
1|borrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of
1|fires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuilding factories
1|and workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face was one for
1|which he had very little aptitude or inclination--practical business.
1|
1|He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But he
1|felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these
1|consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
1|them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the
1|state of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the
1|necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities
1|with serf labor, to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand,
1|Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs,
1|which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the
1|loans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of a speedy
1|emancipation.
1|
1|The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested
1|selling the forests in the province of Kostroma, the land lower down
1|the river, and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all
1|of which operations according to him were connected with such
1|complicated measures--the removal of injunctions, petitions,
1|permits, and so on--that Pierre became quite bewildered and only
1|replied:
1|
1|"Yes, yes, do so."
1|
1|Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled
1|him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only
1|tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The
1|steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he
1|considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and
1|troublesome to himself.
1|
1|In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened
1|to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer,
1|the largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre's
1|greatest weakness--the one to which he had confessed when admitted
1|to the Lodge--were so strong that he could not resist them. Again
1|whole days, weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush
1|and were as much occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches,
1|and balls, giving him no time for reflection, as in Petersburg.
1|Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old
1|life, only in new surroundings.
1|
1|Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not
1|fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral
1|life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two--morality and the
1|love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled
1|another of the precepts--that of reforming the human race--and had
1|other virtues--love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.
1|
1|In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way
1|he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his
1|orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom
1|God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.
1|
1|The chief steward, who considered the young count's attempts
1|almost insane--unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the
1|serfs--made some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation
1|of the serfs as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large
1|buildings--schools, hospitals, and asylums--on all the estates
1|before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for
1|ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for
1|just such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the
1|bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of
1|his master, would touch and delude him.
1|
1|The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna
1|carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on
1|Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more
1|picturesque than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and
1|touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere
1|were receptions, which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a
1|joyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In one place the peasants
1|presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint
1|Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits
1|he had conferred on them, to build a new chantry to the church at
1|their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In
1|another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him
1|for releasing them from hard work. On a third estate the priest,
1|bearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded by children whom, by
1|the count's generosity, he was instructing in reading, writing, and
1|religion. On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick
1|buildings erected or in course of erection, all on one plan, for
1|hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon to be opened.
1|Everywhere he saw the stewards' accounts, according to which the
1|serfs' manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching
1|thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats.
1|
1|What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
1|with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter
1|and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter's
1|day, and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had
1|begun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in
1|that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know
1|that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his
1|land, they did still harder work on their own land. He did not know
1|that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by
1|his exactions, and that the pupils' parents wept at having to let
1|him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments.
1|He did not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being
1|built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased, though
1|lessened on paper. He did not know that where the steward had shown
1|him in the accounts that the serfs' payments had been diminished by
1|a third, their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a
1|half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and
1|quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
1|Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his "brother-instructor"
1|as he called the Grand Master.
1|
1|"How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,"
1|thought Pierre, "and how little attention we pay to it!"
1|
1|He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at
1|receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
1|for these simple, kindly people.
1|
1|The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
1|through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with
1|a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,
1|pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above
1|all the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it
1|was.
1|
1|Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
1|difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would
1|happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though
1|reluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward promised to do
1|all in his power to carry out the count's wishes, seeing clearly
1|that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all
1|measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to
1|release them from the Land Bank, but would probably never even inquire
1|and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing
1|empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all
1|that other people's serfs gave--that is to say, all that could be
1|got out of them.
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest
1|state of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of
1|visiting his friend Bolkonski, whom he had not seen for two years.
1|
1|Bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among
1|fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The
1|house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and
1|with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that
1|stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which
1|were a few fir trees.
1|
1|The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables,
1|a bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular facade
1|still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly
1|laid out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps
1|and a water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were
1|straight, the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore
1|an impress of tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre
1|met, in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a
1|small newly built lodge close to the pond. Anton, a man who had looked
1|after Prince Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage,
1|said that the prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little
1|anteroom.
1|
1|Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house
1|after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend
1|in Petersburg.
1|
1|He quickly entered the small reception room with its
1|still-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone
1|farther, but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.
1|
1|"Well, what is it?" came a sharp, unpleasant voice.
1|
1|"A visitor," answered Anton.
1|
1|"Ask him to wait," and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed
1|back.
1|
1|Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to
1|face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre
1|embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
1|and looked at him closely.
1|
1|"Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with
1|surprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly
1|and there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and
1|lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give
1|them a joyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner,
1|paler, and more manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre
1|till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow
1|indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought.
1|
1|As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged
1|separation, it was long before their conversation could settle on
1|anything. They put questions and gave brief replies about things
1|they knew ought to be talked over at length. At last the
1|conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first
1|lightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierre's
1|journeys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and
1|despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend's look was now
1|still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to
1|Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past
1|or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to
1|sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter
1|began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms,
1|dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew's
1|presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had
1|been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He
1|checked himself, fearing to seem naive, yet he felt an irresistible
1|desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a
1|quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.
1|
1|"I can't tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly
1|know myself again."
1|
1|"Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then," said Prince
1|Andrew.
1|
1|"Well, and you? What are your plans?"
1|
1|"Plans!" repeated Prince Andrew ironically. "My plans?" he said,
1|as if astonished at the word. "Well, you see, I'm building. I mean
1|to settle here altogether next year...."
1|
1|Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew's face,
1|which had grown much older.
1|
1|"No, I meant to ask..." Pierre began, but Prince Andrew
1|interrupted him.
1|
1|"But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your
1|travels and all you have been doing on your estates."
1|
1|Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as
1|far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had
1|been made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre's story of what
1|he had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he
1|listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what
1|Pierre was telling him.
1|
1|Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend's company
1|and at last became silent.
1|
1|"I'll tell you what, my dear fellow," said Prince Andrew, who
1|evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, "I
1|am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am
1|going back to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of
1|course you know her already," he said, evidently trying to entertain a
1|visitor with whom he now found nothing in common. "We will go after
1|dinner. And would you now like to look round my place?"
1|
1|They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the
1|political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know
1|each other intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and
1|interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its
1|buildings, but even here, while on the scaffolding, in the midst of
1|a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house, he interrupted
1|himself:
1|
1|"However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and
1|then we'll set off."
1|
1|At dinner, conversation turned on Pierre's marriage.
1|
1|"I was very much surprised when I heard of it," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said
1|hurriedly: "I will tell you some time how it all happened. But you
1|know it is all over, and forever."
1|
1|"Forever?" said Prince Andrew. "Nothing's forever."
1|
1|"But you know how it all ended, don't you? You heard of the duel?"
1|
1|"And so you had to go through that too!"
1|
1|"One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man," said
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"Why so?" asked Prince Andrew. "To kill a vicious dog is a very good
1|thing really."
1|
1|"No, to kill a man is bad--wrong."
1|
1|"Why is it wrong?" urged Prince Andrew. "It is not given to man to
1|know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will
1|err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong."
1|
1|"What does harm to another is wrong," said Pierre, feeling with
1|pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was
1|roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought
1|him to his present state.
1|
1|"And who has told you what is bad for another man?" he asked.
1|
1|"Bad! Bad!" exclaimed Pierre. "We all know what is bad for
1|ourselves."
1|
1|"Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is
1|something I cannot inflict on others," said Prince Andrew, growing
1|more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new
1|outlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. "I only know two very real
1|evils in life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of
1|those evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole
1|philosophy now."
1|
1|"And love of one's neighbor, and self-sacrifice?" began Pierre. "No,
1|I can't agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to
1|have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself
1|and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least trying"
1|(Pierre's modesty made him correct himself) "to live for others,
1|only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I shall
1|not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are
1|saying." Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.
1|
1|"When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you'll get on with her,"
1|he said. "Perhaps you are right for yourself," he added after a
1|short pause, "but everyone lives in his own way. You lived for
1|yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found
1|happiness when you began living for others. I experienced just the
1|reverse. I lived for glory.--And after all what is glory? The same
1|love of others, a desire to do something for them, a desire for
1|their approval.--So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite,
1|ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only
1|for myself."
1|
1|"But what do you mean by living only for yourself?" asked Pierre,
1|growing excited. "What about your son, your sister, and your father?"
1|
1|"But that's just the same as myself--they are not others," explained
1|Prince Andrew. "The others, one's neighbors, le prochain, as you and
1|Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil.
1|Le prochain--your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good."
1|
1|And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He
1|evidently wished to draw him on.
1|
1|"You are joking," replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.
1|"What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even
1|doing a little--though I did very little and did it very badly? What
1|evil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people
1|like ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and
1|truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed
1|in a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and
1|consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying
1|of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
1|rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum
1|for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a
1|peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give
1|them rest and leisure?" said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. "And I have
1|done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done
1|something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a
1|good action, and more than that, you can't make me believe that you do
1|not think so yourself. And the main thing is," he continued, "that I
1|know, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is
1|the only sure happiness in life."
1|
1|"Yes, if you put it like that it's quite a different matter," said
1|Prince Andrew. "I build a house and lay out a garden, and you build
1|hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what's
1|right and what's good must be judged by one who knows all, but not
1|by us. Well, you want an argument," he added, "come on then."
1|
1|They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which
1|served as a veranda.
1|
1|"Come, let's argue then," said Prince Andrew, "You talk of schools,"
1|he went on, crooking a finger, "education and so forth; that is, you
1|want to raise him" (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking
1|off his cap) "from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual
1|needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only
1|happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him
1|of. I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him
1|my means. Then you say, 'lighten his toil.' But as I see it,
1|physical labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his
1|existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can't help
1|thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I
1|can't sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can't help
1|thinking, just as he can't help plowing and mowing; if he didn't, he
1|would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand
1|his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he
1|could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die.
1|The third thing--what else was it you talked about?" and Prince Andrew
1|crooked a third finger. "Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit,
1|he is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch him up. He will drag
1|about as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for another ten years. It
1|would be far easier and simpler for him to die. Others are being
1|born and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be different if
1|you grudged losing a laborer--that's how I regard him--but you want to
1|cure him from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides,
1|what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!" said
1|he, frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.
1|
1|Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that
1|it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he
1|spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long
1|time. His glance became more animated as his conclusions became more
1|hopeless.
1|
1|"Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!" said Pierre. "I don't understand
1|how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long
1|ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so
1|that I don't live at all--everything seems hateful to me... myself
1|most of all. Then I don't eat, don't wash... and how is it with
1|you?..."
1|
1|"Why not wash? That is not cleanly," said Prince Andrew; "on the
1|contrary one must try to make one's life as pleasant as possible.
1|I'm alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best
1|I can without hurting others."
1|
1|"But with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would
1|sit without moving, undertaking nothing...."
1|
1|"Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do
1|nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me
1|the honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to
1|get out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary
1|qualifications for it--the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness
1|necessary for the position. Then there's this house, which must be
1|built in order to have a nook of one's own in which to be quiet. And
1|now there's this recruiting."
1|
1|"Why aren't you serving in the army?"
1|
1|"After Austerlitz!" said Prince Andrew gloomily. "No, thank you very
1|much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active
1|Russian army. And I won't--not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk
1|threatening Bald Hills--even then I wouldn't serve in the Russian
1|army! Well, as I was saying," he continued, recovering his
1|composure, "now there's this recruiting. My father is chief in command
1|of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active service is
1|to serve under him."
1|
1|"Then you are serving?"
1|
1|"I am."
1|
1|He paused a little while.
1|
1|"And why do you serve?"
1|
1|"Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men
1|of his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he
1|has too energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited
1|power that he is terrible, and now he has this authority of a
1|commander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had
1|been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster's
1|clerk at Yukhnovna hanged," said Prince Andrew with a smile. "So I
1|am serving because I alone have any influence with my father, and
1|now and then can save him from actions which would torment him
1|afterwards."
1|
1|"Well, there you see!"
1|
1|"Yes, but it is not as you imagine," Prince Andrew continued. "I did
1|not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who
1|had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been
1|very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father--that again
1|is for myself."
1|
1|Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered
1|feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there
1|was no desire to do good to his neighbor.
1|
1|"There now, you wish to liberate your serfs," he continued; "that is
1|a very good thing, but not for you--I don't suppose you ever had
1|anyone flogged or sent to Siberia--and still less for your serfs. If
1|they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don't suppose they are
1|any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and
1|the stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it
1|is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon
1|themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being
1|able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people
1|I pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You
1|may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those
1|traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more
1|irritable, become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot
1|restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable."
1|
1|Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking
1|that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his
1|father's case.
1|
1|He did not reply.
1|
1|"So that's what I'm sorry for--human dignity, peace of mind, purity,
1|and not the serfs' backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you
1|may, always remain the same backs and foreheads."
1|
1|"No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you," said
1|Pierre.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and
1|drove to Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the
1|silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good
1|temper.
1|
1|Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making
1|in his husbandry.
1|
1|Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and
1|apparently immersed in his own thoughts.
1|
1|He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did
1|not see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid,
1|enlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he
1|should say, he felt that Prince Andrew with one word, one argument,
1|would upset all his teaching, and he shrank from beginning, afraid
1|of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred.
1|
1|"No, but why do you think so?" Pierre suddenly began, lowering his
1|head and looking like a bull about to charge, "why do you think so?
1|You should not think so."
1|
1|"Think? What about?" asked Prince Andrew with surprise.
1|
1|"About life, about man's destiny. It can't be so. I myself thought
1|like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don't
1|smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it
1|was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal,
1|aspects of humanity."
1|
1|And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince
1|Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed
1|from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality,
1|brotherhood, and love.
1|
1|"Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the
1|rest is a dream," said Pierre. "Understand, my dear fellow, that
1|outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree
1|with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to
1|live out his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But
1|make our fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood,
1|give yourself up to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once
1|feel yourself, as I have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible
1|chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven," said Pierre.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence
1|to Pierre's words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels
1|prevented his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it,
1|and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew's eyes and by
1|his silence, Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that
1|Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.
1|
1|They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they
1|had to cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed
1|on it, they also stepped on the raft.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed
1|silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.
1|
1|"Well, what do you think about it?" Pierre asked. "Why are you
1|silent?"
1|
1|"What do I think about it? I am listening to you. It's all very
1|well.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of
1|life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who
1|are we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see
1|what you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I
1|don't see it."
1|
1|Pierre interrupted him.
1|
1|"Do you believe in a future life?" he asked.
1|
1|"A future life?" Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no
1|time to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as
1|he knew Prince Andrew's former atheistic convictions.
1|
1|"You say you can't see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor
1|could I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the
1|end of everything. On earth, here on this earth" (Pierre pointed to
1|the fields), "there is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the
1|universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we
1|who are now the children of earth are--eternally--children of the
1|whole universe. Don't I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast
1|harmonious whole? Don't I feel that I form one link, one step, between
1|the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of
1|beings in whom the Deity--the Supreme Power if you prefer the term--is
1|manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to
1|man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go
1|farther and farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing
1|vanishes in this world, but that I shall always exist and always
1|have existed. I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits,
1|and that in this world there is truth."
1|
1|"Yes, that is Herder's theory," said Prince Andrew, "but it is not
1|that which can convince me, dear friend--life and death are what
1|convince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound
1|up with one's own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped
1|to make it right" (Prince Andrew's voice trembled and he turned away),
1|"and suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to
1|exist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe
1|there is.... That's what convinces, that is what has convinced me,"
1|said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, of course," said Pierre, "isn't that what I'm saying?"
1|
1|"No. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
1|necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with
1|someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere,
1|and you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have
1|looked in...."
1|
1|"Well, that's it then! You know that there is a there and there is a
1|Someone? There is the future life. The Someone is--God."
1|
1|Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long
1|since been taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The
1|sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was
1|starring the puddles near the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the
1|astonishment of the footmen, coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on
1|the raft and talked.
1|
1|"If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and
1|man's highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must
1|live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on
1|this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there,
1|in the Whole," said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.
1|
1|Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening
1|to Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of
1|the sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness.
1|Pierre became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the
1|waves of the current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew
1|felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre's words,
1|whispering:
1|
1|"It is true, believe it."
1|
1|He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at
1|Pierre's face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his
1|superior friend.
1|
1|"Yes, if it only were so!" said Prince Andrew. "However, it is
1|time to get on," he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at
1|the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since
1|Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on
1|that battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering,
1|something that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and
1|youthful, in his soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the
1|customary conditions of his life, but he knew that this feeling
1|which he did not know how to develop existed within him. His meeting
1|with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew's life. Though
1|outwardly he continued to live in the same old way, inwardly he
1|began a new life.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the
1|front entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the
1|house, Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre's attention to a
1|commotion going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a
1|wallet on her back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black
1|garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up.
1|Two women ran out after them, and all four, looking round at the
1|carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch.
1|
1|"Those are Mary's 'God's folk,'" said Prince Andrew. "They have
1|mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she
1|disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she
1|receives them."
1|
1|"But what are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet
1|them, and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was
1|expected back soon.
1|
1|The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any
1|minute.
1|
1|Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always
1|kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father's house;
1|he himself went to the nursery.
1|
1|"Let us go and see my sister," he said to Pierre when he returned.
1|"I have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her
1|'God's folk.' It will serve her right, she will be confused, but you
1|will see her 'God's folk.' It's really very curious."
1|
1|"What are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Come, and you'll see for yourself."
1|
1|Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her
1|face when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before
1|the icon stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing
1|a monk's cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near
1|them, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek
1|expression on her childlike face.
1|
1|"Andrew, why didn't you warn me?" said the princess, with mild
1|reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her
1|chickens.
1|
1|"Charmee de vous voir. Je suis tres contente de vous voir,"* she
1|said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child,
1|and now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife,
1|and above all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward
1|him. She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to
1|say, "I like you very much, but please don't laugh at my people."
1|After exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.
1|
1|
1|*"Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you."
1|
1|
1|"Ah, and Ivanushka is here too!" said Prince Andrew, glancing with a
1|smile at the young pilgrim.
1|
1|"Andrew!" said Princess Mary, imploringly. "Il faut que vous sachiez
1|que c'est une femme,"* said Prince Andrew to Pierre.
1|
1|"Andrew, au nom de Dieu!"*[2] Princess Mary repeated.
1|
1|
1|*"You must know that this is a woman."
1|
1|*[2] "For heaven's sake."
1|
1|
1|It was evident that Prince Andrew's ironical tone toward the
1|pilgrims and Princess Mary's helpless attempts to protect them were
1|their customary long-established relations on the matter.
1|
1|"Mais, ma bonne amie," said Prince Andrew, "vous devriez au
1|contraire m'etre reconnaissante de ce que j'explique a Pierre votre
1|intimite avec ce jeune homme."*
1|
1|
1|*"But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for
1|explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man."
1|
1|
1|"Really?" said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
1|seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him)
1|into Ivanushka's face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about,
1|looked round at them all with crafty eyes.
1|
1|Princess Mary's embarrassment on her people's account was quite
1|unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman,
1|lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had
1|turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside
1|it, and sat quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered
1|another cup of tea. Ivanushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked
1|with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men.
1|
1|"Where have you been? To Kiev?" Prince Andrew asked the old woman.
1|
1|"I have, good sir," she answered garrulously. "Just at Christmastime
1|I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at
1|the shrine of the saint. And now I'm from Kolyazin, master, where a
1|great and wonderful blessing has been revealed."
1|
1|"And was Ivanushka with you?"
1|
1|"I go by myself, benefactor," said Ivanushka, trying to speak in a
1|bass voice. "I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo..."
1|
1|Pelageya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell
1|what she had seen.
1|
1|"In Kolyazin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed."
1|
1|"What is it? Some new relics?" asked Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Andrew, do leave off," said Princess Mary. "Don't tell him,
1|Pelageya."
1|
1|"No... why not, my dear, why shouldn't I? I like him. He is kind, he
1|is one of God's chosen, he's a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles,
1|I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he's one of
1|God's own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says, 'Why are
1|you not going to the right place? Go to Kolyazin where a
1|wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.' On
1|hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went."
1|
1|All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,
1|drawing in her breath.
1|
1|"So I come, master, and the people say to me: 'A great blessing
1|has been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed
1|Mother, the Holy Virgin Mother of God'...."
1|
1|"All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards," said Princess
1|Mary, flushing.
1|
1|"Let me ask her," said Pierre. "Did you see it yourselves?" he
1|inquired.
1|
1|"Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the
1|face like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother's cheek
1|it drops and drops...."
1|
1|"But, dear me, that must be a fraud!" said Pierre, naively, who
1|had listened attentively to the pilgrim.
1|
1|"Oh, master, what are you saying?" exclaimed the horrified Pelageya,
1|turning to Princess Mary for support.
1|
1|"They impose on the people," he repeated.
1|
1|"Lord Jesus Christ!" exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing
1|herself. "Oh, don't speak so, master! There was a general who did
1|not believe, and said, 'The monks cheat,' and as soon as he'd said
1|it he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the
1|Kiev catacombs came to him and said, 'Believe in me and I will make
1|you whole.' So he begged: 'Take me to her, take me to her.' It's the
1|real truth I'm telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought,
1|quite blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and
1|says, 'Make me whole,' says he, 'and I'll give thee what the Tsar
1|bestowed on me.' I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the
1|icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! It's a sin
1|to speak so. God will punish you," she said admonishingly, turning
1|to Pierre.
1|
1|"How did the star get into the icon?" Pierre asked.
1|
1|"And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?" said
1|Prince Andrew, with a smile.
1|
1|Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.
1|
1|"Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!" she began,
1|her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. "Master, what have you
1|said? God forgive you!" And she crossed herself. "Lord forgive him! My
1|dear, what does it mean?..." she asked, turning to Princess Mary.
1|She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She
1|evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a
1|house where such things could be said, and was at the same time
1|sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house.
1|
1|"Now, why need you do it?" said Princess Mary. "Why did you come
1|to me?..."
1|
1|"Come, Pelageya, I was joking," said Pierre. "Princesse, ma
1|parole, je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser.* I did not mean anything, I
1|was only joking," he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his
1|offense. "It was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking."
1|
1|
1|*"Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her."
1|
1|
1|Pelageya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre's face there was such a
1|look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now
1|at her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a
1|long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his
1|hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks
1|she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking
1|some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with
1|the saints. "I'd pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to
1|another. I'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and
1|there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one don't want
1|to come out, even into the light of heaven again."
1|
1|Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went
1|out of the room, and then, leaving "God's folk" to finish their tea,
1|Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.
1|
1|"You are very kind," she said to him.
1|
1|"Oh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them
1|so well and have the greatest respect for them."
1|
1|Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.
1|
1|"I have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as
1|of a brother," she said. "How do you find Andrew?" she added
1|hurriedly, not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words.
1|"I am very anxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but
1|last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away
1|for a cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has
1|not a character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our
1|sorrows. He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in
1|good spirits, but that is the effect of your visit--he is not often
1|like that. If you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs
1|activity, and this quiet regular life is very bad for him. Others
1|don't notice it, but I see it."
1|
1|Toward ten o'clock the men servants rushed to the front door,
1|hearing the bells of the old prince's carriage approaching. Prince
1|Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch.
1|
1|"Who's that?" asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out
1|of the carriage.
1|
1|"Ah! Very glad! Kiss me," he said, having learned who the young
1|stranger was.
1|
1|The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.
1|
1|Before supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father's study,
1|found him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining
1|that a time would come when there would be no more wars. The old
1|prince disputed it chaffingly, but without getting angry.
1|
1|"Drain the blood from men's veins and put in water instead, then
1|there will be no more war! Old women's nonsense--old women's
1|nonsense!" he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately on
1|the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,
1|evidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over
1|the papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to
1|him and began to talk business.
1|
1|"The marshal, a Count Rostov, hasn't sent half his contingent. He
1|came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner--I gave him a pretty
1|dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy," the old prince
1|went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. "A
1|fine fellow--your friend--I like him! He stirs me up. Another says
1|clever things and one doesn't care to listen, but this one talks
1|rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps
1|I'll come and sit with you at supper. We'll have another dispute. Make
1|friends with my little fool, Princess Mary," he shouted after
1|Pierre, through the door.
1|
1|Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the
1|strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm
1|was not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his
1|family and with the household. With the stern old prince and the
1|gentle, timid Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre
1|at once felt like an old friend. They were all fond of him already.
1|Not only Princess Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the
1|pilgrims, gave him her most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old
1|"Prince Nicholas" (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and
1|let himself be taken in his arms, and Michael Ivanovich and
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he
1|talked to the old prince.
1|
1|The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre's
1|account. And during the two days of the young man's visit he was
1|extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.
1|
1|When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met
1|together, they began to express their opinions of him as people always
1|do after a new acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one
1|said anything but what was good of him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|When returning from his leave, Rostov felt, for the first time, how
1|close was the bond that united him to Denisov and the whole regiment.
1|
1|On approaching it, Rostov felt as he had done when approaching his
1|home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned
1|uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dementyev and
1|saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrushka gleefully
1|shouted to his master, "The count has come!" and Denisov, who had been
1|asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace
1|him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostov
1|experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his
1|sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could
1|not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and
1|precious as his parents' house.
1|
1|When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and
1|had been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had
1|gone out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little
1|interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and
1|bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense
1|of peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in
1|his own place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was
1|none of all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not
1|know his right place and took mistaken decisions; here was no Sonya
1|with whom he ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was
1|no possibility of going there or not going there; here there were
1|not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a
1|variety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of
1|whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there
1|were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his
1|father, and nothing to recall that terrible loss to Dolokhov. Here, in
1|the regiment, all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided
1|into two unequal parts: one, our Pavlograd regiment; the other, all
1|the rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment,
1|everything was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a
1|good fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The
1|canteenkeeper gave one credit, one's pay came every four months, there
1|was nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do nothing that
1|was considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and, when given an order,
1|to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely ordered--and all
1|would be well.
1|
1|Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this
1|regimental life, Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on
1|lying down to rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was
1|all the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to Dolokhov (for
1|which, in spite of all his family's efforts to console him, he could
1|not forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault
1|by serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a
1|perfectly first-rate comrade and officer--in a word, a splendid man
1|altogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so
1|possible in the regiment.
1|
1|After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his
1|parents in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now
1|resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the
1|debt to his parents.
1|
1|Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at
1|Pultusk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It
1|was awaiting the Emperor's arrival and the beginning of a new
1|campaign.
1|
1|The Pavlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had
1|served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in
1|Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of
1|the campaign. It had been neither at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau
1|and, when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the
1|campaign, was attached to Platov's division.
1|
1|Platov's division was acting independently of the main army. Several
1|times parts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the
1|enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal
1|Oudinot's carriages. In April the Pavlograds were stationed
1|immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German
1|village.
1|
1|A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river
1|broke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions
1|for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no
1|transports could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and
1|deserted villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of
1|these.
1|
1|Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled--if
1|any remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be
1|taken from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead
1|of taking anything from them, often gave them the last of their
1|rations.
1|
1|The Pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but
1|had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the
1|hospitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or
1|the swelling that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and
1|hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the
1|hospitals. When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just
1|showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus, which, for
1|some reason, they called "Mashka's sweet root." It was very bitter,
1|but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with
1|their sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not to do so, as
1|it was a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke
1|out among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face,
1|which the doctors attributed to eating this root. But in spite of
1|all this, the soldiers of Denisov's squadron fed chiefly on
1|"Mashka's sweet root," because it was the second week that the last of
1|the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man
1|and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.
1|
1|The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the
1|thatched roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with
1|tufts of felty winter hair.
1|
1|Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living
1|just as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms,
1|the hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed
1|their horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the
1|thatched roofs in place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the
1|caldrons from which they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food
1|and their hunger. As usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires,
1|steamed themselves before them naked; smoked, picked out and baked
1|sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened to stories of
1|Potemkin's and Suvorov's campaigns, or to legends of Alesha the Sly,
1|or the priest's laborer Mikolka.
1|
1|The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,
1|half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes
1|and, in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied
1|themselves as before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money,
1|though there was no food), some with more innocent games, such as
1|quoits and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely
1|spoken of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly
1|because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly.
1|
1|Rostov lived, as before, with Denisov, and since their furlough they
1|had become more friendly than ever. Denisov never spoke of Rostov's
1|family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him,
1|Rostov felt that the elder hussar's luckless love for Natasha played a
1|part in strengthening their friendship. Denisov evidently tried to
1|expose Rostov to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action
1|greeted his safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging
1|expeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come
1|in search of provisions, Rostov found a family consisting of an old
1|Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad,
1|hungry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a
1|conveyance. Rostov brought them to his quarters, placed them in his
1|own lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old man was
1|recovering. One of his comrades, talking of women, began chaffing
1|Rostov, saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it
1|would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish
1|girl he had saved. Rostov took the joke as an insult, flared up, and
1|said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all Denisov
1|could do to prevent a duel. When the officer had gone away, Denisov,
1|who did not himself know what Rostov's relations with the Polish
1|girl might be, began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper, and
1|Rostov replied:
1|
1|"Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can't
1|tell you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason...."
1|
1|Denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
1|without looking at Rostov, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.
1|
1|"Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs are!" he muttered, and Rostov
1|noticed tears in his eyes.
1|

1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor's arrival,
1|but Rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at
1|Bartenstein, as the Pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
1|place.
1|
1|They were bivouacking. Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut,
1|dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf.
1|The hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into
1|vogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight
1|inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were
1|cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself
1|was the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander,
1|had a board, lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve
1|as a table. On each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a
1|breadth of about two and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads
1|and couches. The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in
1|the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew
1|close to the table. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the
1|soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at
1|the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a
1|window. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers' campfire were
1|placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the "reception
1|room"--as Denisov called that part of the hut--and it was then so warm
1|that the officers, of whom there were always some with Denisov and
1|Rostov, sat in their shirt sleeves.
1|
1|In April, Rostov was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and
1|eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers,
1|changed his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got
1|warm, then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner,
1|and, his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on
1|but his shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his
1|head. He was pleasantly considering the probability of being
1|promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition, and
1|was awaiting Denisov, who had gone out somewhere and with whom he
1|wanted a talk.
1|
1|Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the
1|hut, evidently much excited. Rostov moved to the window to see whom he
1|was speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topcheenko.
1|
1|"I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff!" Denisov
1|was shouting. "And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some
1|fwom the fields."
1|
1|"I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they
1|don't obey," answered the quartermaster.
1|
1|Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: "Let
1|him fuss and bustle now, my job's done and I'm lying down--capitally!"
1|He could hear that Lavrushka--that sly, bold orderly of Denisov's--was
1|talking, as well as the quartermaster. Lavrushka was saying
1|something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when
1|he had gone out for provisions.
1|
1|Then Denisov's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.
1|"Saddle! Second platoon!"
1|
1|"Where are they off to now?" thought Rostov.
1|
1|Five minutes later, Denisov came into the hut, climbed with muddy
1|boots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things
1|about, took his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again.
1|In answer to Rostov's inquiry where he was going, he answered
1|vaguely and crossly that he had some business.
1|
1|"Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!" said Denisov
1|going out, and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing
1|through the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had
1|gone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not
1|leave the hut till toward evening. Denisov had not yet returned. The
1|weather had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet
1|were playing svayka, laughing as they threw their missiles which
1|buried themselves in the soft mud. Rostov joined them. In the middle
1|of the game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen
1|hussars on their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the
1|hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars
1|surrounded them.
1|
1|"There now, Denisov has been worrying," said Rostov, "and here are
1|the provisions."
1|
1|"So they are!" said the officers. "Won't the soldiers be glad!"
1|
1|A little behind the hussars came Denisov, accompanied by two
1|infantry officers with whom he was talking.
1|
1|Rostov went to meet them.
1|
1|"I warn you, Captain," one of the officers, a short thin man,
1|evidently very angry, was saying.
1|
1|"Haven't I told you I won't give them up?" replied Denisov.
1|
1|"You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny--seizing the
1|transport of one's own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two
1|days."
1|
1|"And mine have had nothing for two weeks," said Denisov.
1|
1|"It is robbery! You'll answer for it, sir!" said the infantry
1|officer, raising his voice.
1|
1|"Now, what are you pestewing me for?" cried Denisov, suddenly losing
1|his temper. "I shall answer for it and not you, and you'd better not
1|buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!" he shouted at the
1|officers.
1|
1|"Very well, then!" shouted the little officer, undaunted and not
1|riding away. "If you are determined to rob, I'll..."
1|
1|"Go to the devil! quick ma'ch, while you're safe and sound!" and
1|Denisov turned his horse on the officer.
1|
1|"Very well, very well!" muttered the officer, threateningly, and
1|turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.
1|
1|"A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!" shouted Denisov
1|after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
1|mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostov, he burst out laughing.
1|
1|"I've taken twansports from the infantwy by force!" he said.
1|"After all, can't let our men starve."
1|
1|The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
1|infantry regiment, but learning from Lavrushka that the transport
1|was unescorted, Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force. The
1|soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared
1|them with the other squadrons.
1|
1|The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov, and
1|holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said:
1|
1|"This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and
1|won't begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff
1|and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if
1|possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not,
1|as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a
1|row and the affair may end badly."
1|
1|From the regimental commander's, Denisov rode straight to the
1|staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he
1|came back to his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen
1|him in. Denisov could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rostov
1|asked what was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and
1|threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.
1|
1|Alarmed at Denisov's condition, Rostov suggested that he should
1|undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.
1|
1|"Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but
1|I'll always thwash scoundwels... and I'll tell the Empewo'...
1|Ice..." he muttered.
1|
1|The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely
1|necessary to bleed Denisov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken
1|from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had
1|happened to him.
1|
1|"I get there," began Denisov. "'Now then, where's your chief's
1|quarters?' They were pointed out. 'Please to wait.' 'I've widden
1|twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait.
1|Announce me.' Vewy well, so out comes their head chief--also took it
1|into his head to lecture me: 'It's wobbewy!'--'Wobbewy,' I say, 'is
1|not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him
1|who takes them to fill his own pockets!' 'Will you please be silent?'
1|'Vewy good!' Then he says: 'Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner,
1|but your affair will be passed on to headquarters.' I go to the
1|commissioner. I enter, and at the table... who do you think? No, but
1|wait a bit!... Who is it that's starving us?" shouted Denisov, hitting
1|the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the
1|table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about.
1|"Telyanin! 'What? So it's you who's starving us to death! Is it? Take
1|this and this!' and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... 'Ah,
1|what a... what a...!' and I sta'ted fwashing him... Well, I've had a
1|bit of fun I can tell you!" cried Denisov, gleeful and yet angry, his
1|white teeth showing under his black mustache. "I'd have killed him if
1|they hadn't taken him away!"
1|
1|"But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself," said Rostov. "You've
1|set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again."
1|
1|Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke
1|calm and cheerful.
1|
1|But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov's and
1|Denisov's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully
1|showed them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental
1|commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday's occurrence.
1|The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad
1|turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the
1|severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded,
1|degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.
1|
1|The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after
1|seizing the transports, Major Denisov, being drunk, went to the
1|chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief,
1|threatened to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the
1|office and given two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm
1|of one of them.
1|
1|In answer to Rostov's renewed questions, Denisov said, laughing,
1|that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed
1|up in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not
1|in the least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels
1|dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not
1|easily forget.
1|
1|Denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostov knew
1|him too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart
1|he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was
1|evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices
1|from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov was ordered
1|to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
1|the staff of his division to explain his violence at the
1|commissariat office. On the previous day Platov reconnoitered with two
1|Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Denisov, as was his
1|wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A
1|bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of
1|his leg. Perhaps at another time Denisov would not have left the
1|regiment for so slight a wound, but now he took advantage of it to
1|excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the
1|Pavlograds did not take part, and after that an armistice was
1|proclaimed. Rostov, who felt his friend's absence very much, having no
1|news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and
1|the progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get
1|leave to visit Denisov in hospital.
1|
1|The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice
1|devastated by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when
1|it is so beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a
1|particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its
1|foul streets, tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken
1|soldiers wandering about.
1|
1|The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window
1|frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a
1|wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged
1|soldiers, with pale swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in
1|the sunshine in the yard.
1|
1|Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
1|putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army
1|doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian
1|assistant.
1|
1|"I can't tear myself to pieces," the doctor was saying. "Come to
1|Makar Alexeevich in the evening. I shall be there."
1|
1|The assistant asked some further questions.
1|
1|"Oh, do the best you can! Isn't it all the same?" The doctor noticed
1|Rostov coming upstairs.
1|
1|"What do you want, sir?" said the doctor. "What do you want? The
1|bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a
1|pesthouse, sir."
1|
1|"How so?" asked Rostov.
1|
1|"Typhus, sir. It's death to go in. Only we two, Makeev and I" (he
1|pointed to the assistant), "keep on here. Some five of us doctors have
1|died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,"
1|said the doctor with evident satisfaction. "Prussian doctors have been
1|invited here, but our allies don't like it at all."
1|
1|Rostov explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the hussars,
1|who was wounded.
1|
1|"I don't know. I can't tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in
1|charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It's
1|well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of
1|coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost!" he laughed.
1|"Four hundred, sir, and they're always sending me fresh ones. There
1|are four hundred? Eh?" he asked, turning to the assistant.
1|
1|The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and
1|impatient for the talkative doctor to go.
1|
1|"Major Denisov," Rostov said again. "He was wounded at Molliten."
1|
1|"Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makeev?" queried the doctor, in a tone of
1|indifference.
1|
1|The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor's words.
1|
1|"Is he tall and with reddish hair?" asked the doctor.
1|
1|Rostov described Denisov's appearance.
1|
1|"There was one like that," said the doctor, as if pleased. "That one
1|is dead, I fancy. However, I'll look up our list. We had a list.
1|Have you got it, Makeev?"
1|
1|"Makar Alexeevich has the list," answered the assistant. "But if
1|you'll step into the officers' wards you'll see for yourself," he
1|added, turning to Rostov.
1|
1|"Ah, you'd better not go, sir," said the doctor, "or you may have to
1|stay here yourself."
1|
1|But Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the
1|assistant to show him the way.
1|
1|"Only don't blame me!" the doctor shouted up after him.
1|
1|Rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell
1|was so strong there that Rostov held his nose and had to pause and
1|collect his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the
1|right, and an emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in
1|underclothing, limped out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked
1|with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at
1|the door, Rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor
1|on straw and overcoats.
1|
1|"May I go in and look?"
1|
1|"What is there to see?" said the assistant.
1|
1|But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,
1|Rostov entered the soldiers' ward. The foul air, to which he had
1|already begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It
1|was a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where
1|it originated.
1|
1|In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large
1|windows, the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to
1|the walls, and leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were
1|unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were
1|conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all
1|looked intently at Rostov with the same expression of hope, of relief,
1|reproach, and envy of another's health. Rostov went to the middle of
1|the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining
1|rooms saw the same thing there. He stood still, looking silently
1|around. He had not at all expected such a sight. Just before him,
1|almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor, lay a
1|sick man, probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair. The
1|man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. His face was
1|purple, his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen,
1|and on his bare legs and arms which were still red, the veins stood
1|out like cords. He was knocking the back of his head against the
1|floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating. Rostov
1|listened and made out the word. It was "drink, drink, a drink!" Rostov
1|glanced round, looking for someone who would put this man back in
1|his place and bring him water.
1|
1|"Who looks after the sick here?" he asked the assistant.
1|
1|Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from
1|the next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rostov.
1|
1|"Good day, your honor!" he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostov and
1|evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.
1|
1|"Get him to his place and give him some water," said Rostov,
1|pointing to the Cossack.
1|
1|"Yes, your honor," the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his
1|eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not
1|move.
1|
1|"No, it's impossible to do anything here," thought Rostov,
1|lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an
1|intense look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the
1|corner, on an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier
1|as thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently
1|fixed on Rostov. The man's neighbor on one side whispered something to
1|him, pointing at Rostov, who noticed that the old man wanted to
1|speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg
1|bent under him, the other had been amputated above the knee. His
1|neighbor on the other side, who lay motionless some distance from
1|him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with a snub nose.
1|His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled
1|back. Rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his
1|back.
1|
1|"Why, this one seems..." he began, turning to the assistant.
1|
1|"And how we've been begging, your honor," said the old soldier,
1|his jaw quivering. "He's been dead since morning. After all we're men,
1|not dogs."
1|
1|"I'll send someone at once. He shall be taken away--taken away at
1|once," said the assistant hurriedly. "Let us go, your honor."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, let us go," said Rostov hastily, and lowering his eyes
1|and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of
1|reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the
1|room.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|Going along the corridor, the assistant led Rostov to the
1|officers' wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood
1|open. There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers
1|were lying or sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in
1|hospital dressing gowns. The first person Rostov met in the
1|officers' ward was a thin little man with one arm, who was walking
1|about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with
1|a pipe between his teeth. Rostov looked at him, trying to remember
1|where he had seen him before.
1|
1|"See where we've met again!" said the little man. "Tushin, Tushin,
1|don't you remember, who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern? And I've had
1|a bit cut off, you see..." he went on with a smile, pointing to the
1|empty sleeve of his dressing gown. "Looking for Vasili Dmitrich
1|Denisov? My neighbor," he added, when he heard who Rostov wanted.
1|"Here, here," and Tushin led him into the next room, from whence
1|came sounds of several laughing voices.
1|
1|"How can they laugh, or even live at all here?" thought Rostov,
1|still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong
1|in the soldiers' ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those
1|envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face
1|of that young soldier with eyes rolled back.
1|
1|Denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket,
1|though it was nearly noon.
1|
1|"Ah, Wostov? How are you, how are you?" he called out, still in
1|the same voice as in the regiment, but Rostov noticed sadly that under
1|this habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling
1|showed itself in the expression of Denisov's face and the
1|intonations of his voice.
1|
1|His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six
1|weeks after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as
1|the faces of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that
1|struck Rostov. What struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to
1|see him, and smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the
1|regiment, nor about the general state of affairs, and when Rostov
1|spoke of these matters did not listen.
1|
1|Rostov even noticed that Denisov did not like to be reminded of the
1|regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on
1|outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and was
1|only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On
1|Rostov's inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from
1|under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
1|rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began
1|reading his paper and specially drew Rostov's attention to the
1|stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions,
1|who had gathered round Rostov--a fresh arrival from the world
1|outside--gradually began to disperse as soon as Denisov began reading
1|his answer. Rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had
1|already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the
1|man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,
1|gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed Tushin
1|still listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the
1|reading, the Uhlan interrupted Denisov.
1|
1|"But what I say is," he said, turning to Rostov, "it would be best
1|simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will
1|now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted...."
1|
1|"Me petition the Empewo'!" exclaimed Denisov, in a voice to which he
1|tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like
1|an expression of irritable impotence. "What for? If I were a wobber
1|I would ask mercy, but I'm being court-martialed for bwinging
1|wobbers to book. Let them twy me, I'm not afwaid of anyone. I've
1|served the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I
1|to be degwaded?... Listen, I'm w'iting to them stwaight. This is
1|what I say: 'If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...'"
1|
1|"It's certainly well written," said Tushin, "but that's not the
1|point, Vasili Dmitrich," and he also turned to Rostov. "One has to
1|submit, and Vasili Dmitrich doesn't want to. You know the auditor told
1|you it was a bad business."
1|
1|"Well, let it be bad," said Denisov.
1|
1|"The auditor wrote out a petition for you," continued Tushin, "and
1|you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he"
1|(indicating Rostov) "has connections on the staff. You won't find a
1|better opportunity."
1|
1|"Haven't I said I'm not going to gwovel?" Denisov interrupted him,
1|went on reading his paper.
1|
1|Rostov had not the courage to persuade Denisov, though he
1|instinctively felt that the way advised by Tushin and the other
1|officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of
1|service to Denisov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward
1|hasty temper.
1|
1|When the reading of Denisov's virulent reply, which took more than an
1|hour, was over, Rostov said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day
1|in a most dejected state of mind amid Denisov's hospital comrades, who
1|had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to
1|their stories. Denisov was moodily silent all the evening.
1|
1|Late in the evening, when Rostov was about to leave, he asked
1|Denisov whether he had no commission for him.
1|
1|"Yes, wait a bit," said Denisov, glancing round at the officers, and
1|taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where
1|he had an inkpot, and sat down to write.
1|
1|"It seems it's no use knocking one's head against a wall!" he
1|said, coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope. In it
1|was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which
1|Denisov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat
1|officials, simply asked for pardon.
1|
1|"Hand it in. It seems..."
1|
1|He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state
1|of Denisov's affairs, Rostov rode to Tilsit with the letter to the
1|Emperor.
1|
1|On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in
1|Tilsit. Boris Drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom
1|he was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the
1|stay at Tilsit.
1|
1|"I should like to see the great man," he said, alluding to Napoleon,
1|whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.
1|
1|"You are speaking of Buonaparte?" asked the general, smiling.
1|
1|Boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that
1|he was being tested.
1|
1|"I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon," he replied. The
1|general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.
1|
1|"You will go far," he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.
1|
1|Boris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
1|Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon
1|pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw
1|the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a
1|tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon's arrival, saw both
1|Emperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleon--reaching the raft
1|first--stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand
1|to him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had
1|begun to move in the highest circles Boris had made it his habit to
1|watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At
1|the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had
1|come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened
1|attentively to words spoken by important personages. At the moment the
1|Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not
1|forget to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview had
1|lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same
1|evening, among other facts he felt to be of historic importance. As
1|the Emperor's suite was a very small one, it was a matter of great
1|importance, for a man who valued his success in the service, to be at
1|Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors, and
1|having succeeded in this, Boris felt that henceforth his position was
1|fully assured. He had not only become known, but people had grown
1|accustomed to him and accepted him. Twice he had executed commissions
1|to the Emperor himself, so that the latter knew his face, and all
1|those at court, far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they
1|considered him a newcomer, would now have been surprised had he been
1|absent.
1|
1|Boris lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilinski.
1|Zhilinski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond
1|of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French
1|officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and
1|lunching with him and Boris.
1|
1|On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinski
1|arranged a supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an
1|aide-de-camp of Napoleon's, there were also several French officers of
1|the Guard, and a page of Napoleon's, a young lad of an old
1|aristocratic French family. That same day, Rostov, profiting by the
1|darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit
1|and went to the lodging occupied by Boris and Zhilinski.
1|
1|Rostov, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far
1|from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and
1|the French--who from being foes had suddenly become friends--that
1|had taken place at headquarters and in Boris. In the army, Bonaparte
1|and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger,
1|contempt, and fear. Only recently, talking with one of Platov's
1|Cossack officers, Rostov had argued that if Napoleon were taken
1|prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal.
1|Quite lately, happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the
1|road, Rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible
1|between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rostov
1|was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers
1|in Boris' lodging, dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see
1|from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank.
1|As soon as he noticed a French officer, who thrust his head out of the
1|door, that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at
1|the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He stopped at the
1|threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived there.
1|Boris, hearing a strange voice in the anteroom, came out to meet
1|him. An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face
1|on first recognizing Rostov.
1|
1|"Ah, it's you? Very glad, very glad to see you," he said, however,
1|coming toward him with a smile. But Rostov had noticed his first
1|impulse.
1|
1|"I've come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have
1|business," he said coldly.
1|
1|"No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.
1|Dans un moment je suis a vous,"* he said, answering someone who called
1|him.
1|
1|
1|*"In a minute I shall be at your disposal."
1|
1|
1|"I see I'm intruding," Rostov repeated.
1|
1|The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris' face:
1|having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly
1|took both Rostov's hands and led him into the next room. His eyes,
1|looking serenely and steadily at Rostov, seemed to be veiled by
1|something, as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it
1|seemed to Rostov.
1|
1|"Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!" said Boris,
1|and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and
1|introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian,
1|but an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.
1|
1|"Count Zhilinski--le Comte N. N.--le Capitaine S. S.," said he,
1|naming his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed
1|reluctantly, and remained silent.
1|
1|Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very
1|willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov. Boris did not
1|appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the
1|same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with
1|which he had met Rostov, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the
1|Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,
1|addressed the obstinately taciturn Rostov, saying that the latter
1|had probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.
1|
1|"No, I came on business," replied Rostov, briefly.
1|
1|Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look
1|of dissatisfaction on Boris' face, and as always happens to those in a
1|bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion
1|and that he was in everybody's way. He really was in their way, for he
1|alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The
1|looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: "And what is he
1|sitting here for?" He rose and went up to Boris.
1|
1|"Anyhow, I'm in your way," he said in a low tone. "Come and talk
1|over my business and I'll go away."
1|
1|"Oh, no, not at all," said Boris. "But if you are tired, come and
1|lie down in my room and have a rest."
1|
1|"Yes, really..."
1|
1|They went into the little room where Boris slept. Rostov, without
1|sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Boris were to blame in
1|some way) telling him about Denisov's affair, asking him whether,
1|through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor
1|on Denisov's behalf and get Denisov's petition handed in. When he
1|and Boris were alone, Rostov felt for the first time that he could not
1|look Boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness. Boris, with one
1|leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender
1|fingers of his right, listened to Rostov as a general listens to the
1|report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight
1|into Rostov's eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this
1|happened Rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.
1|
1|"I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe
1|in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the
1|Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in
1|general, I think..."
1|
1|"So you don't want to do anything? Well then, say so!" Rostov almost
1|shouted, not looking Boris in the face.
1|
1|Boris smiled.
1|
1|"On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought..."
1|
1|At that moment Zhilinski's voice was heard calling Boris.
1|
1|"Well then, go, go, go..." said Rostov, and refusing supper and
1|remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long
1|time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
1|Denisov's behalf. He could not himself go to the general in attendance
1|as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so,
1|and Boris, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the
1|following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were
1|signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the
1|Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of
1|the First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening,
1|given by a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk
1|battalion. The Emperors were to be present at that banquet.
1|
1|Rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris that, when
1|the latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and
1|early next morning went away, avoiding Boris. In his civilian
1|clothes and a round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the
1|French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the
1|Russian and French Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables
1|being set up and preparations made for the dinner; he saw the
1|Russian and French colors draped from side to side of the streets,
1|with huge monograms A and N. In the windows of the houses also flags
1|and bunting were displayed.
1|
1|"Boris doesn't want to help me and I don't want to ask him. That's
1|settled," thought Nicholas. "All is over between us, but I won't leave
1|here without having done all I can for Denisov and certainly not
1|without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is
1|here!" thought Rostov, who had unconsciously returned to the house
1|where Alexander lodged.
1|
1|Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
1|assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.
1|
1|"I may see him at any moment," thought Rostov. "If only I were to
1|hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really
1|arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand
1|on whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows
1|everything. Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even
1|if they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?" thought
1|he, looking at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor
1|occupied. "After all, people do go in.... It's all nonsense! I'll go
1|in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for
1|Drubetskoy who drives me to it!" And suddenly with a determination
1|he himself did not expect, Rostov felt for the letter in his pocket
1|and went straight to the house.
1|
1|"No, I won't miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz," he
1|thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious
1|of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. "I will fall
1|at his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will
1|even thank me. 'I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice
1|is the greatest happiness,'" Rostov fancied the sovereign saying.
1|And passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the
1|porch of the Emperor's house.
1|
1|A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right
1|he saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading
1|to the lower floor.
1|
1|"Whom do you want?" someone inquired.
1|
1|"To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty," said Nicholas,
1|with a tremor in his voice.
1|
1|"A petition? This way, to the officer on duty" (he was
1|shown the door leading downstairs), "only it won't be accepted."
1|
1|On hearing this indifferent voice, Rostov grew frightened at what he
1|was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so
1|fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run
1|away, but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and
1|Rostov entered.
1|
1|A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots
1|and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing
1|in that room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his
1|breeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some
1|reason, attracted Rostov's attention. This man was speaking to someone
1|in the adjoining room.
1|
1|"A good figure and in her first bloom," he was saying, but on seeing
1|Rostov, he stopped short and frowned.
1|
1|"What is it? A petition?"
1|
1|"What is it?" asked the person in the other room.
1|
1|"Another petitioner," answered the man with the braces.
1|
1|"Tell him to come later. He'll be coming out directly, we must go."
1|
1|"Later... later! Tomorrow. It's too late..."
1|
1|Rostov turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped
1|him.
1|
1|"Whom have you come from? Who are you?"
1|
1|"I come from Major Denisov," answered Rostov.
1|
1|"Are you an officer?"
1|
1|"Lieutenant Count Rostov."
1|
1|"What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with
1|you... go," and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed
1|him.
1|
1|Rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there
1|were many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to
1|pass.
1|
1|Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding
1|himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to
1|shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety
1|of his conduct and repenting of it, Rostov, with downcast eyes, was
1|making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
1|familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.
1|
1|"What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?" asked a deep
1|voice.
1|
1|It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor's special
1|favor during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the
1|division in which Rostov was serving.
1|
1|Rostov, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the
1|kindly, jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an
1|excited voice told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for
1|Denisov, whom the general knew. Having heard Rostov to the end, the
1|general shook his head gravely.
1|
1|"I'm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter."
1|
1|Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining
1|Denisov's case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were
1|heard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the
1|porch. The gentlemen of the Emperor's suite ran down the stairs and
1|went to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at
1|Austerlitz, led up the Emperor's horse, and the faint creak of a
1|footstep Rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the
1|danger of being recognized, Rostov went close to the porch, together
1|with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw those
1|features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the
1|same union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm
1|and love for his sovereign rose again in Rostov's soul in all its
1|old force. In the uniform of the Preobrazhensk regiment--white
1|chamois-leather breeches and high boots--and wearing a star Rostov did
1|not know (it was that of the Legion d'honneur), the monarch came out
1|into the porch, putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his
1|arm. He stopped and looked about him, brightening everything around by
1|his glance. He spoke a few words to some of the generals, and,
1|recognizing the former commander of Rostov's division, smiled and
1|beckoned to him.
1|
1|All the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general talking for
1|some time to the Emperor.
1|
1|The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his
1|horse. Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers
1|(among whom was Rostov) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside
1|his horse, with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the
1|cavalry general and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be
1|heard by all:
1|
1|"I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than
1|I," and he raised his foot to the stirrup.
1|
1|The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and
1|rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm,
1|Rostov ran after him with the crowd.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a
1|battalion of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a
1|battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.
1|
1|As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which
1|presented arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the
1|opposite flank, and at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon. It
1|could be no one else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue
1|uniform open over a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his
1|shoulder. He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse
1|with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. On approaching
1|Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did so, Rostov, with his
1|cavalryman's eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit
1|well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted "Hurrah!" and
1|"Vive l'Empereur!" Napoleon said something to Alexander, and both
1|Emperors dismounted and took each other's hands. Napoleon's face
1|wore an unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying
1|something affable to him.
1|
1|In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes' horses, which
1|were pushing back the crowd, Rostov kept his eyes on every movement of
1|Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander
1|treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease
1|with the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday
1|matter to him.
1|
1|Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites,
1|approached the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and came
1|straight up to the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly
1|found itself so close to the Emperors that Rostov, standing in the
1|front row, was afraid he might be recognized.
1|
1|"Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the
1|bravest of your soldiers," said a sharp, precise voice, articulating
1|every letter.
1|
1|This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into
1|Alexander's eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to
1|him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.
1|
1|"To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,"
1|added Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and
1|assurance exasperating to Rostov, he ran his eyes over the Russian
1|ranks drawn up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes
1|fixed on their Emperor.
1|
1|"Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?" said
1|Alexander and took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlovski, the
1|commander of the battalion.
1|
1|Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,
1|tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him
1|rushed forward and picked it up.
1|
1|"To whom shall it be given?" the Emperor Alexander asked
1|Koslovski, in Russian in a low voice.
1|
1|"To whomever Your Majesty commands."
1|
1|The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing
1|back, remarked:
1|
1|"But we must give him an answer."
1|
1|Kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostov in his
1|scrutiny.
1|
1|"Can it be me?" thought Rostov.
1|
1|"Lazarev!" the colonel called, with a frown, and Lazarev, the
1|first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.
1|
1|"Where are you off to? Stop here!" voices whispered to Lazarev who
1|did not know where to go. Lazarev stopped, casting a sidelong look
1|at his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to
1|soldiers called before the ranks.
1|
1|Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out
1|behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing
1|at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed
1|something from one to another, and a page--the same one Rostov had
1|seen the previous evening at Boris'--ran forward and, bowing
1|respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a
1|moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without
1|looking, pressed two fingers together and the badge was between
1|them. Then he approached Lazarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently
1|gazed at his own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to
1|imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally,
1|and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lazarev's
1|buttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his
1|hand to deign to touch that soldier's breast for the soldier to be
1|forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone else in the
1|world. Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarev's breast and,
1|dropping his hand, turned toward Alexander as though sure that the
1|cross would adhere there. And it really did.
1|
1|Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross
1|and fastened it to the uniform. Lazarev glanced morosely at the little
1|man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still
1|standing motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into
1|Alexander's eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go
1|away, or do something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for
1|some time in that rigid position.
1|
1|The Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhensk battalion,
1|breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the
1|tables prepared for them.
1|
1|Lazarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers
1|embraced him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of
1|officers and civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of
1|Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables
1|in the square. Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and
1|happy, passed by Rostov.
1|
1|"What d'you think of the treat? All on silver plate," one of them
1|was saying. "Have you seen Lazarev?"
1|
1|"I have."
1|
1|"Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner."
1|
1|"Yes, but what luck for Lazarev! Twelve hundred francs' pension
1|for life."
1|
1|"Here's a cap, lads!" shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier, donning a
1|shaggy French cap.
1|
1|"It's a fine thing! First-rate!"
1|
1|"Have you heard the password?" asked one Guards' officer of another.
1|"The day before yesterday it was 'Napoleon, France, bravoure';
1|yesterday, 'Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.' One day our Emperor gives it
1|and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. George's
1|Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be done. He
1|must respond in kind."
1|
1|Boris, too, with his friend Zhilinski, came to see the Preobrazhensk
1|banquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostov standing by the corner
1|of a house.
1|
1|"Rostov! How d'you do? We missed one another," he said, and could
1|not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and
1|troubled was Rostov's face.
1|
1|"Nothing, nothing," replied Rostov.
1|
1|"You'll call round?"
1|
1|"Yes, I will."
1|
1|Rostov stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from
1|a distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on
1|which he could not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in
1|his soul. Now he remembered Denisov with his changed expression, his
1|submission, and the whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and
1|its dirt and disease. So vividly did he recall that hospital stench of
1|dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from. Next
1|he thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white
1|hand, who was now an Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then
1|why those severed arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he
1|thought of Lazarev rewarded and Denisov punished and unpardoned. He
1|caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.
1|
1|The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
1|hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to
1|eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
1|There he found so many people, among them officers who, like
1|himself, had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in
1|getting a dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The
1|conversation naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his
1|comrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied with the peace
1|concluded after the battle of Friedland. They said that had we held
1|out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for, as his troops
1|had neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly
1|the latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by
1|himself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without
1|reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet
1|could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers' saying
1|that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov began shouting
1|with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the
1|officers:
1|
1|"How can you judge what's best?" he cried, the blood suddenly rushing
1|to his face. "How can you judge the Emperor's actions? What right have
1|we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor's aims or his
1|actions!"
1|
1|"But I never said a word about the Emperor!" said the officer,
1|justifying himself, and unable to understand Rostov's outburst, except
1|on the supposition that he was drunk.
1|
1|But Rostov did not listen to him.
1|
1|"We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,"
1|he went on. "If we are ordered to die, we must die. If we're punished,
1|it means that we have deserved it, it's not for us to judge. If the
1|Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an
1|alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If
1|once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred
1|will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God--nothing!"
1|shouted Nicholas, banging the table--very little to the point as it
1|seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own
1|thoughts.
1|
1|"Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That's
1|all...." said he.
1|
1|"And to drink," said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.
1|
1|"Yes, and to drink," assented Nicholas. "Hullo there! Another
1|bottle!" he shouted.
1|
1|In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview
1|with the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg
1|there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.

1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|In 1809 the intimacy between "the world's two arbiters," as Napoleon
1|and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared war on
1|Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our
1|old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and
1|in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and
1|one of Alexander's sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations
1|of foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time
1|keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken
1|in all the departments of government.
1|
1|Life meanwhile--real life, with its essential interests of health
1|and sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in
1|thought, science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and
1|passions--went on as usual, independently of and apart from
1|political friendship or enmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all
1|the schemes of reconstruction.

1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.
1|
1|All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates--and constantly
1|changing from one thing to another had never accomplished--were
1|carried out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible
1|difficulty.
1|
1|He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre
1|lacked, and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.
1|
1|On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and
1|became free agricultural laborers--this being one of the first
1|examples of the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfs' compulsory
1|labor was commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for
1|Bogucharovo at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and
1|writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs.
1|
1|Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father
1|and his son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he
1|spent in "Bogucharovo Cloister," as his father called Prince
1|Andrew's estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the
1|world he had expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went
1|on, received many books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or
1|his father had visitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life,
1|these people lagged behind himself--who never left the country--in
1|knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs.
1|
1|Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
1|books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our
1|last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a
1|reform of the army rules and regulations.
1|
1|In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazan estates which
1|had been inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.
1|
1|Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the
1|new grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of
1|white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not
1|thinking of anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from
1|side to side.
1|
1|They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year
1|before. They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and
1|green fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near
1|the bridge, uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past
1|strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there,
1|and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the
1|forest it was almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with
1|their sticky green leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers
1|and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last
1|year's leaves. The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees
1|scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant
1|reminder of winter. On entering the forest the horses began to snort
1|and sweated visibly.
1|
1|Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter
1|assented. But apparently the coachman's sympathy was not enough for
1|Peter, and he turned on the box toward his master.
1|
1|"How pleasant it is, your excellency!" he said with a respectful
1|smile.
1|
1|"What?"
1|
1|"It's pleasant, your excellency!"
1|
1|"What is he talking about?" thought Prince Andrew. "Oh, the
1|spring, I suppose," he thought as he turned round. "Yes, really
1|everything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry
1|and alders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah,
1|here is one oak!"
1|
1| At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of
1|the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and
1|twice as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as
1|great as a man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its
1|branches had been broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge
1|ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and
1|fingers, it stood an aged, stern, and scornful monster among the
1|smiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about
1|in the forest, and this oak, refused to yield to the charm of spring
1|or notice either the spring or the sunshine.
1|
1|"Spring, love, happiness!" this oak seemed to say. "Are you not
1|weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always
1|the same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness!
1|Look at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too,
1|sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have
1|grown, whether from my back or my sides: as they have grown so I
1|stand, and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies."
1|
1|As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times
1|to look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,
1|too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling,
1|rigid, misshapen, and grim as ever.
1|
1|"Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right," thought Prince
1|Andrew. "Let others--the young--yield afresh to that fraud, but we
1|know life, our life is finished!"
1|
1|A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully
1|pleasant, rose in his soul in connection with that tree. During this
1|journey he, as it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at
1|his old conclusion, restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for
1|him to begin anything anew--but that he must live out his life,
1|content to do no harm, and not disturbing himself or desiring
1|anything.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the
1|district in connection with the affairs of the Ryazan estate of
1|which he was trustee. This Marshal was Count Ilya Rostov, and in the
1|middle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him.
1|
1|It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already
1|clothed in green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water
1|one longed to bathe.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about
1|which he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the
1|grounds of the Rostovs' house at Otradnoe. He heard merry girlish
1|cries behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to
1|cross the path of his caleche. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran
1|a dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz
1|dress, with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose
1|locks of hair escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing
1|that he was a stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.
1|
1|Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so
1|beautiful, the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim
1|pretty girl did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was
1|contented and cheerful in her own separate--probably foolish--but
1|bright and happy life. "What is she so glad about? What is she
1|thinking of? Not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of
1|the Ryazan serfs' quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so
1|happy?" Prince Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.
1|
1|In 1809 Count Ilya Rostov was living at Otradnoe just as he had done
1|in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province
1|with hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince
1|Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his
1|staying the night.
1|
1|During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by
1|his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old
1|count's house was crowded on account of an approaching name day),
1|Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Natasha, gay and laughing among
1|the younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, "What
1|is she thinking about? Why is she so glad?"
1|
1|That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to
1|sleep. He read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It
1|was hot in the room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He
1|was cross with the stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had
1|made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not
1|yet arrived from town, and he was vexed with himself for having
1|stayed.
1|
1|He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened
1|the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for
1|this, burst into the room. He opened the casement. The night was
1|fresh, bright, and very still. Just before the window was a row of
1|pollard trees, looking black on one side and with a silvery light on
1|the other. Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush, wet, bushy
1|vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there. Farther
1|back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew, to the right was
1|a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches, and above it
1|shone the moon, nearly at its full, in a pale, almost starless, spring
1|sky. Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his
1|eyes rested on that sky.
1|
1|His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were
1|also awake. He heard female voices overhead.
1|
1|"Just once more," said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew
1|recognized at once.
1|
1|"But when are you coming to bed?" replied another voice.
1|
1|"I won't, I can't sleep, what's the use? Come now for the last
1|time."
1|
1| Two girlish voices sang a musical passage--the end of some song.
1|
1|"Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there's an end of it."
1|
1|"You go to sleep, but I can't," said the first voice, coming
1|nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the
1|rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard.
1|Everything was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the
1|shadows. Prince Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his
1|unintentional presence.
1|
1|"Sonya! Sonya!" he again heard the first speaker. "Oh, how can you
1|sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,
1|Sonya!" she said almost with tears in her voice. "There never, never
1|was such a lovely night before!"
1|
1|Sonya made some reluctant reply.
1|
1|"Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come
1|here.... Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like
1|sitting down on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this,
1|straining tight, as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this...."
1|
1|"Take care, you'll fall out."
1|
1|He heard the sound of a scuffle and Sonya's disapproving voice:
1|"It's past one o'clock."
1|
1|"Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!"
1|
1|Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting
1|there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.
1|
1|"O God, O God! What does it mean?" she suddenly exclaimed. "To bed
1|then, if it must be!" and she slammed the casement.
1|
1|"For her I might as well not exist!" thought Prince Andrew while
1|he listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that
1|she might say something about him. "There she is again! As if it
1|were on purpose," thought he.
1|
1|In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of
1|youthful thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his
1|life, that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down
1|and fell asleep at once.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not
1|waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.
1|
1|It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he
1|drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so
1|strange and memorable an impression on him. In the forest the
1|harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks
1|before, for now all was thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs
1|dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but,
1|lending themselves to the mood around, were delicately green with
1|fluffy young shoots.
1|
1|The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but
1|only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling
1|the road and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in
1|the shade, the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and
1|scarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the
1|nightingales trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now
1|far away.
1|
1|"Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed," thought
1|Prince Andrew. "But where is it?" he again wondered, gazing at the
1|left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with
1|admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured,
1|spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and
1|slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled
1|fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in
1|evidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were
1|no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old
1|veteran could have produced.
1|
1|"Yes, it is the same oak," thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he
1|was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal.
1|All the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory.
1|Austerlitz with the lofty heavens, his wife's dead reproachful face,
1|Pierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night,
1|and that night itself and the moon, and.... all this rushed suddenly
1|to his mind.
1|
1|"No, life is not over at thirty-one!" Prince Andrew suddenly decided
1|finally and decisively. "It is not enough for me to know what I have
1|in me--everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted
1|to fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may
1|not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it,
1|but so that it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live
1|in harmony!"
1|
1|
1|On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that
1|autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole
1|series of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be
1|essential for him to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the
1|service, kept springing up in his mind. He could not now understand
1|how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an
1|active share in life, just as a month before he had not understood how
1|the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head. It
1|now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be
1|senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again
1|played an active part in life. He did not even remember how
1|formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments, it
1|had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now, after
1|the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe in the
1|possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or
1|love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey to
1|Ryazan he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer
1|interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,
1|went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he
1|would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled
1|a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame.
1|She did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked
1|simply, merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing
1|his arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling,
1|as he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as
1|a crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with
1|Pierre, with fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman's
1|beauty and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he
1|was particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.
1|
1|"My dear," Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say,
1|"little Nicholas can't go out today, it's very cold."
1|
1|"If it were hot," Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly
1|to his sister, "he could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he
1|must wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That
1|is what follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child
1|who needs fresh air should remain at home," he would add with
1|extreme logic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical
1|emotions that stirred within him.
1|
1|At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work
1|dries men up.

1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time
1|when the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his
1|reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That
1|same August the Emperor was thrown from his caleche, injured his
1|leg, and remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving Speranski every
1|day and no one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being
1|prepared that so agitated society--abolishing court ranks and
1|introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate
1|Assessor and State Councilor--and not merely these but a whole state
1|constitution, intended to change the existing order of government in
1|Russia: legal, administrative, and financial, from the Council of
1|State down to the district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams
1|with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he
1|had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates,
1|Czartoryski, Novosiltsev, Kochubey, and Strogonov--whom he himself
1|in jest had called his Comite de salut public--were taking shape and
1|being realized.
1|
1|Now all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil side,
1|and Arakcheev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew,
1|as a gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a
1|levee. The Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with
1|a single word. It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he
1|was antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his
1|face and personality generally, and in the cold, repellent glance
1|the Emperor gave him, he now found further confirmation of this
1|surmise. The courtiers explained the Emperor's neglect of him by His
1|Majesty's displeasure at Bolkonski's not having served since 1805.
1|
1|"I know myself that one cannot help one's sympathies and
1|antipathies," thought Prince Andrew, "so it will not do to present
1|my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor
1|personally, but the project will speak for itself."
1|
1|He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend
1|of his father's. The field marshal made an appointment to see him,
1|received him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few
1|days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see
1|the Minister of War, Count Arakcheev.
1|
1|
1|On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev's waiting
1|room at nine in the morning.
1|
1|He did not know Arakcheev personally, had never seen him, and all he
1|had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.
1|
1|"He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not
1|concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been
1|commissioned to consider my project, so he alone can get it
1|adopted," thought Prince Andrew as he waited among a number of
1|important and unimportant people in Count Arakcheev's waiting room.
1|
1|During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen
1|the anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such
1|rooms were well known to him. Count Arakcheev's anteroom had quite a
1|special character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting
1|their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the
1|faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of
1|awkwardness, covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of
1|themselves, their situation, and the person for whom they were
1|waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others whispered and
1|laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname "Sila Andreevich" and the
1|words, "Uncle will give it to us hot," in reference to Count
1|Arakcheev. One general (an important personage), evidently feeling
1|offended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing his
1|legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.
1|
1|But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
1|faces--that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the
1|adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look
1|and was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others
1|had been shown in and out of the minister's room by the adjutant on
1|duty, an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and
1|frightened air was admitted at that terrible door. This officer's
1|audience lasted a long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a
1|harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door, and the
1|officer--with pale face and trembling lips--came out and passed
1|through the waiting room, clutching his head.
1|
1|After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer
1|on duty said in a whisper, "To the right, at the window."
1|
1|Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man
1|of forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep
1|wrinkles, scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an
1|overhanging red nose. Arakcheev turned his head toward him without
1|looking at him.
1|
1|"What is your petition?" asked Arakcheev.
1|
1|"I am not petitioning, your excellency," returned Prince Andrew
1|quietly.
1|
1|Arakcheev's eyes turned toward him.
1|
1|"Sit down," said he. "Prince Bolkonski?"
1|
1|"I am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has
1|deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me..."
1|
1|"You see, my dear sir, I have read your project," interrupted
1|Arakcheev, uttering only the first words amiably and then--again
1|without looking at Prince Andrew--relapsing gradually into a tone of
1|grumbling contempt. "You are proposing new military laws? There are
1|many laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody
1|designs laws, it is easier writing than doing."
1|
1|"I came at His Majesty the Emperor's wish to learn from your
1|excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have
1|presented," said Prince Andrew politely.
1|
1|"I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to
1|the committee. I do not approve of it," said Arakcheev, rising and
1|taking a paper from his writing table. "Here!" and he handed it to
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Across the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,
1|misspelled, and without punctuation: "Unsoundly constructed because
1|resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the
1|Articles of War needlessly deviating."
1|
1|"To what committee has the memorandum been referred?" inquired
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that
1|your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary."
1|
1|Prince Andrew smiled.
1|
1|"I don't want one."
1|
1|"A member without salary," repeated Arakcheev. "I have the
1|honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?" he shouted, bowing
1|to Prince Andrew.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the
1|committee Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances,
1|particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need.
1|In Petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the
1|eve of a battle, when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly
1|attracted to the ruling circles where the future, on which the fate of
1|millions depended, was being shaped. From the irritation of the
1|older men, the curiosity of the uninitiated, the reserve of the
1|initiated, the hurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the
1|innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned
1|every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast
1|civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in chief of which was
1|a mysterious person he did not know, but who was supposed to be a
1|man of genius--Speranski. And this movement of reconstruction of which
1|Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Speranski its chief promoter,
1|began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army
1|regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception
1|in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The
1|reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place
1|because he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly
1|because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of
1|being a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured
1|the innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy in their
1|disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the son of his
1|father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because he was
1|rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a
1|halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss
1|of his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him
1|previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five
1|years, having softened and grown more manly, lost his former
1|affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and acquired the
1|serenity that comes with years. People talked about him, were
1|interested in him, and wanted to meet him.
1|
1|The day after his interview with Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrew
1|spent the evening at Count Kochubey's. He told the count of his
1|interview with Sila Andreevich (Kochubey spoke of Arakcheev by that
1|nickname with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the
1|Minister of War's anteroom).
1|
1|"Mon cher, even in this case you can't do without Michael
1|Mikhaylovich Speranski. He manages everything. I'll speak to him. He
1|has promised to come this evening."
1|
1|"What has Speranski to do with the army regulations?" asked Prince
1|Andrew.
1|
1|Kochubey shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolkonski's
1|simplicity.
1|
1|"We were talking to him about you a few days ago," Kochubey
1|continued, "and about your freed plowmen."
1|
1|"Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?" said an old
1|man of Catherine's day, turning contemptuously toward Bolkonski.
1|
1|"It was a small estate that brought in no profit," replied Prince
1|Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old
1|man uselessly.
1|
1|"Afraid of being late..." said the old man, looking at Kochubey.
1|
1|"There's one thing I don't understand," he continued. "Who will plow
1|the land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but difficult
1|to rule.... Just the same as now--I ask you, Count--who will be
1|heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?"
1|
1|"Those who pass the examinations, I suppose," replied Kochubey,
1|crossing his legs and glancing round.
1|
1|"Well, I have Pryanichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a
1|priceless man, but he's sixty. Is he to go up for examination?"
1|
1|"Yes, that's a difficulty, as education is not at all general,
1|but..."
1|
1|Count Kochubey did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the
1|arm, and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a
1|large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness,
1|who was just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with
1|a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It
1|was Speranski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a
1|throb within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it
1|was from respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know.
1|Speranski's whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily
1|recognizable. In the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never
1|seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed
1|such calmness and self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet
1|gentle an expression as that in those half-closed, rather humid
1|eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; nor had he heard such
1|a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such
1|delicate whiteness of face or hands--hands which were broad, but
1|very plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew
1|had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in
1|hospital. This was Speranski, Secretary of State, reporter to the
1|Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he had more than once met
1|and talked with Napoleon.
1|
1|Speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as
1|people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no
1|hurry to speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be
1|listened to, and he looked only at the person with whom he was
1|conversing.
1|
1|Prince Andrew followed Speranski's every word and movement with
1|particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men who
1|judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting anyone
1|new--especially anyone whom, like Speranski, he knew by
1|reputation--expected to discover in him the perfection of human
1|qualities.
1|
1|Speranski told Kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come
1|sooner as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that
1|the Emperor had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation
1|of modesty. When Kochubey introduced Prince Andrew, Speranski slowly
1|turned his eyes to Bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at
1|him in silence.
1|
1|"I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as
1|everyone has," he said after a pause.
1|
1|Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given
1|Bolkonski. Speranski smiled more markedly.
1|
1|"The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend
1|Monsieur Magnitski," he said, fully articulating every word and
1|syllable, "and if you like I can put you in touch with him." He paused
1|at the full stop. "I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to
1|co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable."
1|
1|A circle soon formed round Speranski, and the old man who had talked
1|about his subordinate Pryanichnikov addressed a question to him.
1|
1|Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every
1|movement of Speranski's: this man, not long since an insignificant
1|divinity student, who now, Bolkonski thought, held in his hands--those
1|plump white hands--the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the
1|extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speranski answered the
1|old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an
1|immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,
1|Speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or
1|disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.
1|
1|Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Speranski
1|rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of
1|the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest
1|himself in Bolkonski.
1|
1|"I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated
1|conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me," he said
1|with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile
1|that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the
1|people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince
1|Andrew. "I have known of you for a long time: first from your action
1|with regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very
1|desirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because
1|you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not
1|considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the
1|ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and
1|tittle-tattle."
1|
1|"No," said Prince Andrew, "my father did not wish me to take
1|advantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade."
1|
1|"Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above
1|our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely
1|reestablishes natural justice."
1|
1|"I think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,"
1|returned Prince Andrew, trying to resist Speranski's influence, of
1|which he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in
1|everything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke
1|easily and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now
1|while talking with Speranski. He was too much absorbed in observing
1|the famous man's personality.
1|
1|"Grounds of personal ambition maybe," Speranski put in quietly.
1|
1|"And of state interest to some extent," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"What do you mean?" asked Speranski quietly, lowering his eyes.
1|
1|"I am an admirer of Montesquieu," replied Prince Andrew, "and his
1|idea that le principe des monarchies est l'honneur me parait
1|incontestable. Certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me
1|paraissent etre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment."*
1|
1|
1|*"The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable.
1|Certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means
1|of maintaining that sentiment."
1|
1|
1|The smile vanished from Speranski's white face, which was much
1|improved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew's thought interested
1|him.
1|
1|"Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,"* he began,
1|pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower
1|than in Russian but quite calmly.
1|
1|
1|*"If you regard the question from that point of view."
1|
1|
1|Speranski went on to say that honor, l'honeur, cannot be upheld by
1|privileges harmful to the service; that honor, l'honneur, is either
1|a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a
1|source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which
1|recognize it. His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.
1|
1|"An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one
1|similar to the Legion d'honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not
1|harmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class
1|or court privilege."
1|
1|"I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court
1|privileges have attained the same end," returned Prince Andrew. "Every
1|courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily."
1|
1|"Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,"
1|said Speranski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably
1|an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. "If you will
1|do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday," he added, "I will,
1|after talking with Magnitski, let you know what may interest you,
1|and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you."
1|
1|Closing his eyes, he bowed a la francaise, without taking leave, and
1|trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew
1|felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of
1|seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed
1|him in that city.
1|
1|On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook
1|four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The
1|mechanism of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time
1|everywhere, absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did
1|nothing, did not even think or find time to think, but only talked,
1|and talked successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.
1|
1|He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the
1|same remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy
1|for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was
1|thinking of nothing.
1|
1|As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey's, Speranski
1|produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when
1|he received him tete-a-tate at his own house and talked to him long
1|and confidentially.
1|
1|To Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
1|creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of
1|that perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that
1|in Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and
1|virtuous man. Had Speranski sprung from the same class as himself and
1|possessed the same breeding and traditions, Bolkonski would soon have
1|discovered his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speranski's
1|strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the
1|more because he did not quite understand him. Moreover, Speranski,
1|either because he appreciated the other's capacity or because he
1|considered it necessary to win him to his side, showed off his
1|dispassionate calm reasonableness before Prince Andrew and flattered
1|him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with
1|self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one's companion
1|is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of
1|the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one's own
1|ideas.
1|
1|During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speranski
1|more than once remarked: "We regard everything that is above the
1|common level of rooted custom..." or, with a smile: "But we want the
1|wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe..." or: "They cannot
1|understand this..." and all in a way that seemed to say: "We, you
1|and I, understand what they are and who we are."
1|
1|This first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened in
1|Prince Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first
1|meeting. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast
1|intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power,
1|which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia. In Prince
1|Andrew's eyes Speranski was the man he would himself have wished to
1|be--one who explained all the facts of life reasonably, considered
1|important only what was rational, and was capable of applying the
1|standard of reason to everything. Everything seemed so simple and
1|clear in Speranski's exposition that Prince Andrew involuntarily
1|agreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued, it was
1|only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit
1|to Speranski's opinions entirely. Everything was right and
1|everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince
1|Andrew. This was Speranski's cold, mirrorlike look, which did not
1|allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands,
1|which Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the
1|hands of those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those
1|delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was
1|unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he
1|observed in Speranski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he
1|used to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental
1|device, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince
1|Andrew, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a
1|practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and
1|laugh ironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or
1|suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one
1|he very frequently employed.) He would transfer a question to
1|metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time, and
1|thought, and, having deduced the refutation he needed, would again
1|descend to the level of the original discussion.
1|
1|In general the trait of Speranski's mentality which struck Prince
1|Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and
1|authority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur
1|to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is
1|after all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had
1|never felt the doubt, "Is not all I think and believe nonsense?" And
1|it was just this peculiarity of Speranski's mind that particularly
1|attracted Prince Andrew.
1|
1|During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt a
1|passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt
1|for Bonaparte. The fact that Speranski was the son of a village
1|priest, and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account
1|of his humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to
1|cherish his sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to
1|strengthen it.
1|
1|On that first evening Bolkonski spent with him, having mentioned the
1|Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speranski told him
1|sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and
1|fifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that
1|Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the
1|different codes.
1|
1|"And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,"
1|said he. "We want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have
1|no laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to
1|serve in these times!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in
1|jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess.
1|
1|"But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious
1|circle from which we must break a way out."
1|
1|A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army
1|Regulations and--what he had not at all expected--was chairman of a
1|section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At
1|Speranski's request he took the first part of the Civil Code that
1|was being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the
1|Institutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section on
1|Personal Rights.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to
1|Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found
1|himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He
1|arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members,
1|and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic
1|charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented
1|as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the
1|majority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported almost
1|singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg.
1|
1|His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations
1|and dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he
1|considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations
1|of the bachelor circles in which he moved.
1|
1|Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre
1|at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to
1|rest upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under
1|him. At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under
1|him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had
1|joined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who
1|confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his
1|foot down it sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground,
1|he put his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in
1|it, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.
1|
1|Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg--he had of late stood
1|aside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost
1|entirely in Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew
1|in ordinary life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely
1|as Brothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Ivan Vasilevich D.,
1|whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under
1|the Masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at
1|which they aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and
1|reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in
1|promises from a dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay
1|as himself, Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother
1|promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on
1|which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul.
1|
1|He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first
1|he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the
1|lodges or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the
1|mystical science of the order: with questions of the threefold
1|designation of God, the three primordial elements--sulphur, mercury,
1|and salt--or the meaning of the square and all the various figures
1|of the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to
1|which the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought,
1|Joseph Alexeevich himself, but he did not share their interests. His
1|heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.
1|
1|In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like
1|him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a
1|straight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.
1|
1|In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority)
1|who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and
1|ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without
1|troubling about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and
1|even the Grand Master of the principal lodge.
1|
1|Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,
1|particularly those who had lately joined. These according to
1|Pierre's observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor
1|desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate
1|with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their
1|connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.
1|
1|Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing.
1|Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him
1|based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry
1|itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path
1|and deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end of
1|the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the
1|order.
1|
1|In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our
1|Freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov
1|had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons, had been
1|initiated into many mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade,
1|and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the
1|advantage of the Masonic cause in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons
1|all came to see him, tried to ingratiate themselves with him, and it
1|seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and
1|concealing it.
1|
1|A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened,
1|at which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers
1|what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their
1|order. The meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre
1|rose and began his address.
1|
1|"Dear Brothers," he began, blushing and stammering, with a written
1|speech in his hand, "it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries
1|in the seclusion of our lodge--we must act--act! We are drowsing,
1|but we must act." Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.
1|
1|"For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of
1|virtue," he read, "we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse
1|principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the
1|education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
1|wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity,
1|and folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by
1|unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power.
1|
1|"To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over
1|vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this
1|world, receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great
1|endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of
1|today. What is to be done in these circumstances? To favor
1|revolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?... No! We are
1|very far from that. Every violent reform deserves censure, for it
1|quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, and also
1|because wisdom needs no violence.
1|
1|"The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of
1|preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of
1|conviction--aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and
1|patronizing talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and
1|attaching them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the
1|power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder
1|and to control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we
1|must found a form of government holding universal sway, which should
1|be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of
1|citizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue in
1|their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great
1|aim of our order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice.
1|This aim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and
1|good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction
1|of the best and wisest men.
1|
1|"At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching
1|alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her
1|with special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods.
1|It is now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in
1|virtue a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate
1|the passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it
1|is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his
1|passions within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means
1|to that end.
1|
1|"As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,
1|each of them again training two others and all being closely united,
1|everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret
1|accomplished much for the welfare of mankind."
1|
1|This speech not only made a strong impression, but created
1|excitement in the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it
1|dangerous designs of Illuminism,* met it with a coldness that
1|surprised Pierre. The Grand Master began answering him, and Pierre
1|began developing his views with more and more warmth. It was long
1|since there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties were formed, some
1|accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others supporting him. At that
1|meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of
1|men's minds, which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself
1|identically to two persons. Even those members who seemed to be on his
1|side understood him in their own way with limitations and
1|alterations he could not agree to, as what he always wanted most was
1|to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it.
1|
1|
1|*The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical
1|institutions.
1|
1|
1|At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will
1|reproved Bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
1|alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.
1|Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
1|be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for
1|the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For
1|three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a
1|sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere.
1|
1|It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who
1|implored him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and
1|how she wished to devote her whole life to him.
1|
1|At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she
1|would return to Petersburg from abroad.
1|
1|Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre
1|respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and,
1|turning the conversation upon Pierre's matrimonial affairs, by way
1|of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his
1|wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of
1|Freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent.
1|
1|At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasili's wife, sent to
1|him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a
1|most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy
1|against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and
1|in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him.
1|Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much
1|importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed
1|him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his
1|wife.
1|
1|"No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to
1|blame," he thought.
1|
1|If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife,
1|it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to
1|take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned
1|her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of
1|indifference whether he lived with his wife or not?
1|
1|Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre
1|late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see
1|Joseph Alexeevich. This is what he noted in his diary:
1|
1|
1|Moscow, 17th November
1|
1|I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I
1|have experienced. Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three
1|years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has
1|ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till
1|late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working at
1|science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on
1|which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of
1|Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild
1|smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.
1|I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed
1|to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of
1|my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alexeevich, having remained silent
1|and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which
1|at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.
1|He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the
1|order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The
1|purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The
1|improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which
1|is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and
1|self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently
1|of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the
1|greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of
1|this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
1|impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of the
1|human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
1|profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is
1|attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground
1|Joseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the
1|depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said
1|to me, "the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in
1|perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties
1|of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary, my
1|dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
1|our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge--for man can only know himself
1|by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by
1|conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue--love of death.
1|Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our
1|innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life." These words are all
1|the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,
1|Joseph Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death, for
1|which--in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man--he does
1|not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained
1|to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out
1|to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He
1|advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to
1|take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting
1|the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path
1|self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for
1|myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end
1|he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will
1|in future note down all my actions.
1|
1|
1|Petersburg, 23rd November
1|
1|I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears
1|and said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her;
1|that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I
1|knew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to
1|go on refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know
1|whose aid and advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would
1|have told me what to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph
1|Alexeevich's letters and recalled my conversations with him, and
1|deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a suppliant, and
1|ought to reach a helping hand to everyone--especially to one so
1|closely bound to me--and that I must bear my cross. But if I forgive
1|her for the sake of doing right, then let union with her have only a
1|spiritual aim. That is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph
1|Alexeevich. I told my wife that I begged her to forget the past, to
1|forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her, and that I had
1|nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need not know
1|how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on the upper
1|floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
1|regeneration.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at
1|court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each
1|with its own particular tone. The largest of these was the French
1|circle of the Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumyantsev
1|and Caulaincourt. In this group Helene, as soon as she had settled
1|in Petersburg with her husband, took a very prominent place. She was
1|visited by the members of the French embassy and by many belonging
1|to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners.
1|
1|Helene had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the
1|Emperors and had brought from there these connections with the
1|Napoleonic notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant.
1|Napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her:
1|"C'est un superbe animal."* Her success as a beautiful and elegant
1|woman did not surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer
1|than before. What did surprise him was that during these last two
1|years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation "d' une femme
1|charmante, aussi spirituelle que belle."*[2] The distinguished
1|Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. Bilibin saved up his
1|epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezukhova's presence. To be
1|received in the Countess Bezukhova's salon was regarded as a diploma
1|of intellect. Young men read books before attending Helene's evenings,
1|to have something to say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy,
1|and even ambassadors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a
1|way Helene was a power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid,
1|sometimes attended, with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her
1|evenings and dinner parties, where politics, poetry, and philosophy
1|were discussed. At these parties his feelings were like those of a
1|conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment.
1|But whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a
1|salon, or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the
1|deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and Helene Bezukhova's
1|reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established
1|that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody
1|would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound
1|meaning in it of which she herself had no conception.
1|
1|
1|*"That's a superb animal."
1|
1|*[2] "Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely."
1|
1|
1|Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He
1|was that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no
1|one's way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general
1|impression of the drawing room, he served, by the contrast he
1|presented to her, as an advantageous background to his elegant and
1|tactful wife. Pierre during the last two years, as a result of his
1|continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt
1|for all else, had acquired in his wife's circle, which did not
1|interest him, that air of unconcern, indifference, and benevolence
1|toward all, which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore
1|inspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife's drawing room as
1|one enters a theater, was acquainted with everybody, equally pleased
1|to see everyone, and equally indifferent to them all. Sometimes he
1|joined in a conversation which interested him and, regardless of
1|whether any "gentlemen of the embassy" were present or not,
1|lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not at all in
1|accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general opinion
1|concerning the queer husband of "the most distinguished woman in
1|Petersburg" was so well established that no one took his freaks
1|seriously.
1|
1|Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, Boris
1|Drubetskoy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was
1|the most intimate friend of the Bezukhov household since Helene's
1|return from Erfurt. Helene spoke of him as "mon page" and treated
1|him like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody, but
1|sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Boris
1|behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade of
1|deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three
1|years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected
1|him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition,
1|first by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing
1|himself to suspect.
1|
1|"No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally
1|renounced her former infatuations," he told himself. "There has
1|never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs
1|of the heart"--a statement which, though gathered from an unknown
1|source, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Boris' presence
1|in his wife's drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a
1|physical effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed
1|the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.
1|
1|"What a strange antipathy," thought Pierre, "yet I used to like
1|him very much."
1|
1|In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather
1|blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who
1|did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured
1|fellow. But a complex and difficult process of internal development
1|was taking place all this time in Pierre's soul, revealing much to him
1|and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it
1|during that time:
1|
1|
1|24th November
1|
1|Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. [By
1|Joseph Alexeevich's advice Pierre had entered the service of the state
1|and served on one of the committees.] Returned home for dinner and
1|dined alone--the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and
1|drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the
1|Brothers. In the evening I went down to the countess and told a
1|funny story about B., and only remembered that I ought not to have
1|done so when everybody laughed loudly at it.
1|
1|I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me
1|to walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and
1|deliberation, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion,
1|(3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the
1|state, (b) family duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the
1|management of my affairs.
1|
1|
1|27th November
1|
1|I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,
1|help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the
1|Scriptures, but without proper feeling. Brother Urusov came and we
1|talked about worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor's new
1|projects. I began to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my
1|benefactor's words--that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker
1|for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not
1|called on to assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O.
1|visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a
1|new Brother. They laid on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak
1|and unworthy. Then our talk turned to the interpretation of the
1|seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven sciences, the seven
1|virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.
1|Brother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the admission took place.
1|The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the
1|magnificence of the spectacle. It was Boris Drubetskoy who was
1|admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange feeling
1|agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber. I
1|caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I
1|vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like to save him
1|from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of
1|him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in entering
1|the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of
1|our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several times
1|whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I
1|could not reply) and that according to my observation he is
1|incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied
1|and satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I
1|had no cause to doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all
1|the time I stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me
1|that he was smiling contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to
1|stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it. I could not be
1|eloquent, nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to
1|the Grand Master. Great Architect of Nature, help me to find the
1|true path out of the labyrinth of lies!
1|
1|
1| After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then
1|the following was written:
1|
1|
1|I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who
1|advised me to hold fast by brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was
1|revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim
1|is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name
1|unutterable which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen,
1|refresh, and support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt
1|has no place. The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane
1|science and our sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human
1|sciences dissect everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to
1|examine it. In the holy science of our order all is one, all is
1|known in its entirety and life. The Trinity--the three elements of
1|matter--are sulphur, mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and
1|fiery nature; in combination with salt by its fiery nature it
1|arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts
1|mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination produces other
1|bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence. Christ, the
1|Holy Spirit, Him!...
1|
1|
1|3rd December
1|
1|Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went
1|and paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but
1|instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago,
1|when Dolokhov, meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I
1|was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence. At
1|the time I gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that
1|meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter
1|replies. I recollected myself and drove away that thought only when
1|I found myself glowing with anger, but I did not sufficiently
1|repent. Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy came and began relating various
1|adventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I said something
1|disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much that was
1|unpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I recollected
1|myself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with him
1|at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so
1|become much worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on
1|the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his
1|presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave so that he too
1|may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I
1|clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, "Thy day!"
1|
1|I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded
1|by dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my
1|left thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it
1|with my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger
1|one, began biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the
1|bigger and heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking
1|my arm, led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a
1|narrow plank. I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to
1|clamber up a fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After
1|much effort I dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one
1|side and my body on the other. I looked round and saw Brother A.
1|standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden,
1|and in the garden was a large and beautiful building. I woke up. O
1|Lord, great Architect of Nature, help me to tear from myself these
1|dogs--my passions especially the last, which unites in itself the
1|strength of all the former ones, and aid me to enter that temple of
1|virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream.
1|
1|
1|7th December
1|
1|I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house, and that I
1|was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered
1|incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this
1|could not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace
1|him. But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and
1|grown young, and he was quietly telling me something about the
1|teaching of our order, but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it
1|seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened. We
1|were sitting or lying on the floor. He was telling me something, and I
1|wished to show him my sensibility, and not listening to what he was
1|saying I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and
1|the grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and I
1|was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation and jumped
1|up, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he
1|had been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a
1|kind look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where
1|there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with
1|longing to caress him and lie down too. And he said, "Tell me
1|frankly what is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think you
1|know it already." Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was
1|my chief temptation. He shook his head incredulously; and even more
1|abashed, I said that though I was living with my wife as he advised, I
1|was not living with her as her husband. To this he replied that one
1|should not deprive a wife of one's embraces and gave me to
1|understand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should be
1|ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and
1|found in my mind the text from the Gospel: "The life was the light
1|of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
1|comprehended it not." Joseph Alexeevich's face had looked young and
1|bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he
1|wrote about "conjugal duties."
1|
1|
1|9th December
1|
1|I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw
1|that I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and
1|Joseph Alexeevich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at
1|once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in
1|him, and I rushed to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands,
1|and he said, "Hast thou noticed that my face is different?" I looked
1|at him, still holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young,
1|but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite
1|changed. And I said, "I should have known you had I met you by
1|chance," and I thought to myself, "Am I telling the truth?" And
1|suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered
1|and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of
1|drawing paper; I said, "I drew that," and he answered by bowing his
1|head. I opened the book, and on all the pages there were excellent
1|drawings. And in my dream I knew that these drawings represented the
1|love adventures of the soul with its beloved. And on its pages I saw a
1|beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and
1|with a transparent body, flying up to the clouds. And I seemed to know
1|that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the Song of
1|Songs. And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt that I was doing
1|wrong, but could not tear myself away from them. Lord, help me! My
1|God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but if I am
1|myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall perish of my
1|debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!

1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|The Rostovs' monetary affairs had not improved during the two
1|years they had spent in the country.
1|
1|Though Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was
1|still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending
1|comparatively little, the way of life at Otradnoe--Mitenka's
1|management of affairs, in particular--was such that the debts
1|inevitably increased every year. The only resource obviously
1|presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official
1|post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he
1|said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time.
1|
1|Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vera and was
1|accepted.
1|
1|Though in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society without
1|themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of
1|acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they
1|were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow
1|without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.
1|
1|The Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in
1|Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country
1|neighbors from Otradnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,
1|Peronskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bezukhov, and the son of their
1|district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the
1|men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostovs' house in
1|Petersburg were Boris, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and
1|dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostovs'
1|and paid the eldest daughter, Countess Vera, the attentions a young
1|man pays when he intends to propose.
1|
1|Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
1|Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He
1|narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air
1|that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he
1|had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.
1|
1|In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had
1|picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp
1|standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his
1|commander. Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this
1|occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again
1|believed it had been necessary to do this, and he received two
1|decorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in
1|the Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in
1|Petersburg.
1|
1|Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg's merits, it could not
1|be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent
1|terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant
1|career before him and an assured position in society.
1|
1|Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a
1|Moscow theater, Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him and had
1|said in German, "das soll mein Weib werden,"* and from that moment had
1|made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered
1|the Rostovs' position and his own, he decided that the time had come
1|to propose.
1|
1|
1|*"That girl shall be my wife."
1|
1|
1|Berg's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
1|flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an
1|obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess
1|Rostova; but Berg's chief characteristic was such a naive and good
1|natured egotism that the Rostovs involuntarily came to think it
1|would be a good thing, since he himself was so firmly convinced that
1|it was good, indeed excellent. Moreover, the Rostovs' affairs were
1|seriously embarrassed, as the suitor could not but know; and above
1|all, Vera was twenty-four, had been taken out everywhere, and though
1|she was certainly good-looking and sensible, no one up to now had
1|proposed to her. So they gave their consent.
1|
1|"You see," said Berg to his comrade, whom he called "friend" only
1|because he knew that everyone has friends, "you see, I have considered
1|it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if
1|it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and
1|mamma are now provided for--I have arranged that rent for them in
1|the Baltic Provinces--and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with
1|her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not
1|marrying for money--I consider that dishonorable--but a wife should
1|bring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the
1|service, she has connections and some means. In our times that is
1|worth something, isn't it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable
1|girl, and she loves me..."
1|
1|Berg blushed and smiled.
1|
1|"And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.
1|Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite
1|different--an unpleasant character and has not the same
1|intelligence. She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my
1|fiancee!... Well, you will be coming," he was going to say, "to dine,"
1|but changed his mind and said "to take tea with us," and quickly
1|doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke,
1|perfectly embodying his dream of happiness.
1|
1|After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by
1|Berg's proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times
1|took possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and
1|insincere. In the family's feeling toward this wedding a certain
1|awkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not
1|having loved Vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off
1|their hands. The old count felt this most. He would probably have been
1|unable to state the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from
1|the state of his affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what
1|his debts amounted to, or what dowry he could give Vera. When his
1|daughters were born he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an
1|estate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had
1|already been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so
1|much in arrears that it would have to be sold, so that it was
1|impossible to give it to Vera. Nor had he any money.
1|
1|Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained
1|before the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own
1|mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At
1|one time the count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of
1|selling a forest, at another time of borrowing money on a note of
1|hand. A few days before the wedding Berg entered the count's study
1|early one morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his
1|future father-in-law to let him know what Vera's dowry would be. The
1|count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without
1|consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head. "I like
1|your being businesslike about it.... I like it. You shall be
1|satisfied...."
1|
1|And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the
1|conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did
1|not know for certain how much Vera would have and did not receive at
1|least part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters
1|off.
1|
1|"Because, consider, Count--if I allowed myself to marry now
1|without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be
1|acting badly...."
1|
1|The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and
1|to avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand
1|for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on
1|the shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was
1|impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty
1|thousand in ready money. "Or at least twenty thousand, Count," he
1|added, "and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, all right!" said the count hurriedly. "Only excuse me, my
1|dear fellow, I'll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for
1|eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|Natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which
1|she had counted on her fingers with Boris after they had kissed four
1|years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before Sonya and her
1|mother, if Boris happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of
1|that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not
1|worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question
1|whether her engagement to Boris was a jest or an important, binding
1|promise tormented her.
1|
1|Since Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen
1|the Rostovs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed
1|near Otradnoe, but had never been to see them.
1|
1|Sometimes it occurred to Natasha that he did not wish to see her, and
1|this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders
1|spoke of him.
1|
1|"Nowadays old friends are not remembered," the countess would say
1|when Boris was mentioned.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently,
1|seemed to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke
1|rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the
1|brilliant career on which he had entered. When the Rostovs came to
1|Petersburg Boris called on them.
1|
1|He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natasha was
1|his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of
1|letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between
1|himself and Natasha could not be binding either on her or on him. He
1|had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with
1|Countess Bezukhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to
1|the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he
1|enjoyed, and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the
1|richest heiresses in Petersburg, plans which might very easily be
1|realized. When he entered the Rostovs' drawing room Natasha was in her
1|own room. When she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the
1|drawing room, flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile.
1|
1|Boris remembered Natasha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining
1|from under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had
1|known her four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a
1|different Natasha entered, and his face expressed rapturous
1|astonishment. This expression on his face pleased Natasha.
1|
1|"Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?" asked the
1|countess.
1|
1|Boris kissed Natasha's hand and said that he was astonished at the
1|change in her.
1|
1|"How handsome you have grown!"
1|
1|"I should think so!" replied Natasha's laughing eyes.
1|
1|"And is Papa older?" she asked.
1|
1|Natasha sat down and, without joining in Boris' conversation with
1|the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood's suitor. He
1|felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced
1|at her occasionally.
1|
1|Boris' uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were
1|all comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natasha noticed at
1|once. He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess,
1|arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his
1|left hand like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined
1|compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg
1|society, recalling with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow
1|acquaintances. It was not accidentally, Natasha felt, that he alluded,
1|when speaking of the highest aristocracy, to an ambassador's ball he
1|had attended, and to invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.
1|
1|All this time Natasha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her
1|brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Boris more and more. He looked
1|round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.
1|He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave.
1|The same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still
1|looked at him. After his first visit Boris said to himself that
1|Natasha attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield
1|to that feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune,
1|would mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations
1|without intending to marry her would be dishonorable. Boris made up
1|his mind to avoid meeting Natasha, but despite that resolution he
1|called again a few days later and began calling often and spending
1|whole days at the Rostovs'. It seemed to him that he ought to have an
1|explanation with Natasha and tell her that the old times must be
1|forgotten, that in spite of everything... she could not be his wife,
1|that he had no means, and they would never let her marry him. But he
1|failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an
1|explanation. From day to day he became more and more entangled. It
1|seemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love with Boris as
1|of old. She sang him his favorite songs, showed him her album, making
1|him write in it, did not allow him to allude to the past, letting it
1|be understood how delightful was the present; and every day he went
1|away in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and not knowing
1|what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end. He left off
1|visiting Helene and received reproachful notes from her every day, and
1|yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,
1|without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing
1|under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
1|bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Natasha, also
1|in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
1|curlpapers, ran in. The countess--her prayerful mood dispelled--looked
1|round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: "Can it be
1|that this couch will be my grave?" Natasha, flushed and eager,
1|seeing her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down,
1|and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing
1|that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and,
1|rapidly slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her
1|slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might
1|become her grave. This couch was high, with a feather bed and five
1|pillows each smaller than the one below. Natasha jumped on it, sank
1|into the feather bed, rolled over to the wall, and began snuggling
1|up the bedclothes as she settled down, raising her knees to her
1|chin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly, now covering
1|herself up head and all, and now peeping at her mother. The countess
1|finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face, but
1|seeing, that Natasha's head was covered, she smiled in her kind,
1|weak way.
1|
1|"Now then, now then!" said she.
1|
1|"Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?" said Natasha. "Now, just one on
1|your throat and another... that'll do!" And seizing her mother round
1|the neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her
1|mother Natasha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that
1|however she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without
1|hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.
1|
1|"Well, what is it tonight?" said the mother, having arranged her
1|pillows and waited until Natasha, after turning over a couple of
1|times, had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her
1|arms, and assumed a serious expression.
1|
1|These visits of Natasha's at night before the count returned from
1|his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and
1|daughter.
1|
1|"What is it tonight?--But I have to tell you..."
1|
1|Natasha put her hand on her mother's mouth.
1|
1|"About Boris... I know," she said seriously; "that's what I have
1|come about. Don't say it--I know. No, do tell me!" and she removed her
1|hand. "Tell me, Mamma! He's nice?"
1|
1|"Natasha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say
1|Boris is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what
1|then?... What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his
1|head, I can see that...."
1|
1|As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter.
1|Natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the
1|mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the
1|countess only saw her daughter's face in profile. That face struck her
1|by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.
1|
1|Natasha was listening and considering.
1|
1|"Well, what then?" said she.
1|
1|"You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him?
1|You know you can't marry him."
1|
1|"Why not?" said Natasha, without changing her position.
1|
1|"Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a
1|relation... and because you yourself don't love him."
1|
1|"How do you know?"
1|
1|"I know. It is not right, darling!"
1|
1| "But if I want to..." said Natasha.
1|
1|"Leave off talking nonsense," said the countess.
1|
1|"But if I want to..."
1|
1|"Natasha, I am in earnest..."
1|
1|Natasha did not let her finish. She drew the countess' large hand to
1|her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned
1|it over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between
1|the knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, "January, February,
1|March, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don't you say anything? Speak!"
1|said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her
1|daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she
1|had wished to say.
1|
1|"It won't do, my love! Not everyone will understand this
1|friendship dating from your childish days, and to see him so
1|intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who
1|visit us, and above all it torments him for nothing. He may already
1|have found a suitable and wealthy match, and now he's half crazy."
1|
1|"Crazy?" repeated Natasha.
1|
1|"I'll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin..."
1|
1|"I know! Cyril Matveich... but he is old."
1|
1|"He was not always old. But this is what I'll do, Natasha, I'll have
1|a talk with Boris. He need not come so often...."
1|
1|"Why not, if he likes to?"
1|
1|"Because I know it will end in nothing...."
1|
1|"How can you know? No, Mamma, don't speak to him! What nonsense!"
1|said Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. "Well,
1|I won't marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it."
1|Natasha smiled and looked at her mother. "Not to marry, but just
1|so," she added.
1|
1|"How so, my pet?"
1|
1|"Just so. There's no need for me to marry him. But... just so."
1|
1|"Just so, just so," repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she
1|went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.
1|
1|"Don't laugh, stop!" cried Natasha. "You're shaking the whole bed!
1|You're awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait..." and she
1|seized the countess' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little
1|finger, saying, "June," and continued, kissing, "July, August," on the
1|other hand. "But, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you think?
1|Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And he's very nice, very,
1|very nice. Only not quite my taste--he is so narrow, like the
1|dining-room clock.... Don't you understand? Narrow, you know--gray,
1|light gray..."
1|
1|"What rubbish you're talking!" said the countess.
1|
1|Natasha continued: "Don't you really understand? Nicholas would
1|understand.... Bezukhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is
1|square."
1|
1|"You flirt with him too," said the countess, laughing.
1|
1|"No, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue
1|and red.... How can I explain it to you?"
1|
1|"Little countess!" the count's voice called from behind the door.
1|"You're not asleep?" Natasha jumped up, snatched up her slippers,
1|and ran barefoot to her own room.
1|
1|It was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no
1|one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.
1|
1|"Sonya?" she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little
1|kitten with her enormous plait of hair. "No, how could she? She's
1|virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know
1|anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how
1|clever I am and how... charming she is," she went on, speaking of
1|herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise
1|man--the wisest and best of men--who was saying it of her. "There is
1|everything, everything in her," continued this man. "She is
1|unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty,
1|uncommonly pretty, and agile--she swims and rides splendidly... and
1|her voice! One can really say it's a wonderful voice!"
1|
1|She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw
1|herself on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would
1|immediately fall asleep, called Dunyasha the maid to put out the
1|candle, and before Dunyasha had left the room had already passed
1|into yet another happier world of dreams, where everything was as
1|light and beautiful as in reality, and even more so because it was
1|different.
1|
1|
1|Next day the countess called Boris aside and had a talk with him,
1|after which he ceased coming to the Rostovs'.

1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|On the thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, 1809 --10 an old
1|grandee of Catherine's day was giving a ball and midnight supper.
1|The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.
1|
1|The grandee's well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered
1|with innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit
1|entrance which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but
1|dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood
1|at the porch. Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving,
1|with red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the
1|carriages emerged men wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while
1|ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps
1|which were let down for them with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly
1|and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance.
1|
1|Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through
1|the crowd and caps were doffed.
1|
1|"The Emperor?... No, a minister.... prince... ambassador. Don't
1|you see the plumes?..." was whispered among the crowd.
1|
1|One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone
1|and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.
1|
1|A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostovs, who
1|were to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.
1|
1|There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in
1|the Rostov family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive,
1|that the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be
1|arranged as it should be.
1|
1|Marya Ignatevna Peronskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at
1|the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the
1|countess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg high
1|society, was to accompany them to the ball.
1|
1|They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten
1|o'clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were
1|not yet dressed.
1|
1|Natasha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight
1|that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all
1|day. All her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring
1|that they all--she herself, Mamma, and Sonya--should be as well
1|dressed as possible. Sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in
1|her hands. The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and
1|the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their
1|bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque.
1|
1|Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks,
1|and ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the
1|openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were
1|already on; the hairdressing was almost done. Sonya was finishing
1|dressing and so was the countess, but Natasha, who had bustled about
1|helping them all, was behindhand. She was still sitting before a
1|looking-glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender
1|shoulders. Sonya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and,
1|pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger, was
1|fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through it.
1|
1|"That's not the way, that's not the way, Sonya!" cried Natasha
1|turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the
1|maid who was dressing it had not time to release. "That bow is not
1|right. Come here!"
1|
1|Sonya sat down and Natasha pinned the ribbon on differently.
1|
1|"Allow me, Miss! I can't do it like that," said the maid who was
1|holding Natasha's hair.
1|
1|"Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That's right, Sonya."
1|
1|"Aren't you ready? It is nearly ten," came the countess' voice.
1|
1|"Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?"
1|
1|"I have only my cap to pin on."
1|
1|"Don't do it without me!" called Natasha. "You won't do it right."
1|
1|"But it's already ten."
1|
1|They had decided to be at the ball by half past ten, and Natasha had
1|still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.
1|
1|When her hair was done, Natasha, in her short petticoat from under
1|which her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother's dressing jacket,
1|ran up to Sonya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother.
1|Turning her mother's head this way and that, she fastened on the cap
1|and, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were
1|turning up the hem of her skirt.
1|
1|The cause of the delay was Natasha's skirt, which was too long.
1|Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
1|thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
1|countess and Sonya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer
1|garment up high on one uplifted hand.
1|
1|"Mavra, quicker, darling!"
1|
1|"Give me my thimble, Miss, from there..."
1|
1|"Whenever will you be ready?" asked the count coming to the door.
1|"Here is some scent. Peronskaya must be tired of waiting."
1|
1|"It's ready, Miss," said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze
1|dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as
1|if by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of
1|what she held.
1|
1|Natasha began putting on the dress.
1|
1|"In a minute! In a minute! Don't come in, Papa!" she cried to her
1|father as he opened the door--speaking from under the filmy skirt
1|which still covered her whole face.
1|
1|Sonya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in.
1|He was wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and
1|was perfumed and his hair pomaded.
1|
1|"Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!" cried Natasha, as she stood
1|in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.
1|
1|"If you please, Miss! allow me," said the maid, who on her knees was
1|pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of
1|her mouth to the other with her tongue.
1|
1|"Say what you like," exclaimed Sonya, in a despairing voice as she
1|looked at Natasha, "say what you like, it's still too long."
1|
1|Natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress
1|was too long.
1|
1|"Really, madam, it is not at all too long," said Mavra, crawling
1|on her knees after her young lady.
1|
1|"Well, if it's too long we'll take it up... we'll tack it up in
1|one minute," said the resolute Dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck
1|on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set
1|to work once more.
1|
1|At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in
1|her cap and velvet gown.
1|
1|"Oo-oo, my beauty!" exclaimed the count, "she looks better than
1|any of you!"
1|
1|He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside
1|fearing to be rumpled.
1|
1|"Mamma, your cap, more to this side," said Natasha. "I'll arrange
1|it," and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up
1|her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn
1|off.
1|
1|"Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!"
1|
1|"Never mind, I'll run it up, it won't show," said Dunyasha.
1|
1|"What a beauty--a very queen!" said the nurse as she came to the
1|door. "And Sonya! They are lovely!"
1|
1|At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and
1|started. But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.
1|
1|Peronskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she
1|had gone through the same process as the Rostovs, but with less
1|flurry--for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was
1|washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed
1|behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing
1|room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her
1|old lady's maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs'
1|servants had been.
1|
1|She praised the Rostovs' toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,
1|and at eleven o'clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they
1|settled themselves in their carriages and drove off.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not
1|once had time to think of what lay before her.
1|
1|In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage,
1|she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her
1|there at the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms--with music,
1|flowers, dances, the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of
1|Petersburg. The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it
1|would come true, so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness
1|and closeness of the carriage. She understood all that awaited her
1|only when, after stepping over the red baize at the entrance, she
1|entered the hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside Sonya and in
1|front of her mother, mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between
1|the flowers. Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball,
1|and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable
1|for a girl on such an occasion. But, fortunately for her, she felt her
1|eyes growing misty, she saw nothing clearly, her pulse beat a
1|hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed at her heart. She
1|could not assume that pose, which would have made her ridiculous,
1|and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all
1|her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that became
1|her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering, also
1|talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the
1|landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with
1|diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.
1|
1|Natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her
1|reflection from the others. All was blended into one brilliant
1|procession. On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices,
1|footsteps, and greetings deafened Natasha, and the light and glitter
1|dazzled her still more. The host and hostess, who had already been
1|standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to
1|the various arrivals, "Charme de vous voir,"* greeted the Rostovs
1|and Peronskaya in the same manner.
1|
1|
1|*"Delighted to see you."
1|
1|
1|The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her
1|black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess' eye
1|involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natasha. She looked at her and
1|gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as
1|hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden,
1|irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The
1|host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was
1|his daughter.
1|
1|"Charming!" said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.
1|
1|In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
1|the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front
1|rows of that crowd. Natasha heard and felt that several people were
1|asking about her and looking at her. She realized that those
1|noticing her liked her, and this observation helped to calm her.
1|
1|"There are some like ourselves and some worse," she thought.
1|
1|Peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important
1|people at the ball.
1|
1|"That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,"
1|she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray
1|curly hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he
1|said.
1|
1|"Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezukhova," said
1|Peronskaya, indicating Helene who had just entered. "How lovely! She
1|is quite equal to Marya Antonovna. See how the men, young and old, pay
1|court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince--is quite mad
1|about her. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even
1|more run after."
1|
1|She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very
1|plain daughter.
1|
1|"She is a splendid match, a millionairess," said Peronskaya. "And
1|look, here come her suitors."
1|
1|"That is Bezukhova's brother, Anatole Kuragin," she said, indicating
1|a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head
1|erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies. "He's
1|handsome, isn't he? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl.
1|But your cousin, Drubetskoy, is also very attentive to her. They say
1|she has millions. Oh yes, that's the French ambassador himself!" she
1|replied to the countess' inquiry about Caulaincourt. "Looks as if he
1|were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.
1|No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still
1|the most beautiful of them all, our Marya Antonovna! And how simply
1|she is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the
1|universal Freemason," she went on, indicating Pierre. "Put him
1|beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!"
1|
1|Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the
1|crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly
1|as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through,
1|evidently looking for someone.
1|
1|Natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, "the
1|buffoon," as Peronskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for
1|them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and
1|introduce partners to her.
1|
1|But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome,
1|dark man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a
1|window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natasha at
1|once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it
1|was Bolkonski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger,
1|happier, and better-looking.
1|
1|"There's someone else we know--Bolkonski, do you see, Mamma?" said
1|Natasha, pointing out Prince Andrew. "You remember, he stayed a
1|night with us at Otradnoe."
1|
1|"Oh, you know him?" said Peronskaya. "I can't bear him. Il fait a
1|present la pluie et le beau temps.* He's too proud for anything.
1|Takes after his father. And he's hand in glove with Speranski, writing
1|some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There's one
1|talking to him and he has turned away," she said, pointing at him.
1|"I'd give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies."
1|
1|
1|*"He is all the rage just now."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and
1|then back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor
1|entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up.
1|Behind him walked his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing
1|to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the
1|reception over. The band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on
1|account of the words that had been set to it, beginning: "Alexander,
1|Elisaveta, all our hearts you ravish quite..." The Emperor passed on
1|to the drawing room, the crowd made a rush for the doors, and
1|several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again.
1|Then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing-room door, at which
1|the Emperor reappeared talking to the hostess. A young man, looking
1|distraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking them to move aside.
1|Some ladies, with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the
1|rules of decorum, pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets.
1|The men began to choose partners and take their places for the
1|polonaise.
1|
1|Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing
1|room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the
1|music. The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina; then came
1|ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Peronskaya
1|diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners and
1|were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the
1|polonaise. Natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and
1|Sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not
1|having been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms
1|hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly,
1|and with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight
1|before her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She
1|was not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people
1|whom Peronskaya was pointing out--she had but one thought: "Is it
1|possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to
1|dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?
1|They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they
1|were saying, 'Ah, she's not the one I'm after, so it's not worth
1|looking at her!' No, it's impossible," she thought. "They must know
1|how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would
1|enjoy dancing with me."
1|
1|The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable
1|time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha's ears.
1|She wanted to cry. Peronskaya had left them. The count was at the
1|other end of the room. She and the countess and Sonya were standing by
1|themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of
1|strangers, with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone.
1|Prince Andrew with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them.
1|The handsome Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and
1|looked at Natasha as one looks at a wall. Boris passed them twice
1|and each time turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing,
1|came up to them.
1|
1|This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natasha--as if there
1|were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did
1|not listen to or look at Vera, who was telling her something about her
1|own green dress.
1|
1|At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced
1|with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the
1|Rostovs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they
1|were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the
1|distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The
1|Emperor looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had
1|yet begun dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went
1|up to Countess Bezukhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly
1|raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him.
1|The aide-de-camp, an adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly
1|round her waist, with confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding
1|first round the edge of the circle, then at the corner of the room
1|he caught Helene's left hand and turned her, the only sound audible,
1|apart from the ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of
1|the spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his
1|partner's velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled
1|round. Natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not
1|she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing
1|stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in
1|the front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs. Baron Firhoff
1|was talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State
1|to be held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with
1|Speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission,
1|could give reliable information about that sitting, concerning which
1|various rumors were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was
1|saying, he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men
1|intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the
1|circle.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor's
1|presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to
1|dance.
1|
1|Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.
1|
1|"You always dance. I have a protegee, the young Rostova, here. Ask
1|her," he said.
1|
1|"Where is she?" asked Bolkonski. "Excuse me!" he added, turning to
1|the baron, "we will finish this conversation elsewhere--at a ball
1|one must dance." He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.
1|The despairing, dejected expression of Natasha's face caught his
1|eye. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her
1|debut, remembered her conversation at the window, and with an
1|expression of pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostova.
1|
1|"Allow me to introduce you to my daughter," said the countess,
1|with heightened color.
1|
1|"I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess
1|remembers me," said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
1|belying Peronskaya's remarks about his rudeness, and approaching
1|Natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed
1|his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on
1|Natasha's face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly
1|brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.
1|
1|"I have long been waiting for you," that frightened happy little
1|girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as
1|she raised her hand to Prince Andrew's shoulder. They were the
1|second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best
1|dancers of his day and Natasha danced exquisitely. Her little feet
1|in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly,
1|and independently of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic
1|happiness. Her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful--compared
1|to Helene's her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But
1|Helene seemed, as it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands
1|of looks that had scanned her person, while Natasha was like a girl
1|exposed for the first time, who would have felt very much ashamed
1|had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary.
1|
1|Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as
1|possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed
1|to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he
1|disliked, caused by the Emperor's presence, he danced, and had
1|chosen Natasha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she
1|was the first pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he
1|embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close
1|to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to
1|his head, and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after
1|leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|After Prince Andrew, Boris came up to ask Natasha for a dance, and
1|then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young
1|men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous
1|partners to Sonya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She
1|noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did
1|she fail to notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French
1|ambassador, and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or
1|that Prince So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and
1|that Helene had great success and was honored by the special attention
1|of So-and-so, but she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed
1|that he had gone because the ball became livelier after his departure.
1|For one of the merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again
1|her partner. He reminded her of their first encounter in the Otradnoe
1|avenue, and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and
1|told her how he had involuntarily overheard her. Natasha blushed at
1|that recollection and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been
1|something to be ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.
1|
1|Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked
1|meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And
1|such was Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and
1|even her mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special
1|care and tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest
1|and most unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the
1|middle of the cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Natasha,
1|still out of breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer
1|chose her. She was tired and panting and evidently thought of
1|declining, but immediately put her hand gaily on the man's shoulder,
1|smiling at Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"I'd be glad to sit beside you and rest: I'm tired; but you see
1|how they keep asking me, and I'm glad of it, I'm happy and I love
1|everybody, and you and I understand it all," and much, much more was
1|said in her smile. When her partner left her Natasha ran across the
1|room to choose two ladies for the figure.
1|
1|"If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she
1|will be my wife," said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own
1|surprise, as he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.
1|
1|"What rubbish sometimes enters one's head!" thought Prince Andrew,
1|"but what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,
1|that she won't be dancing here a month before she will be
1|married.... Such as she are rare here," he thought, as Natasha,
1|readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself
1|beside him.
1|
1|When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up
1|to the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and
1|asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natasha did not
1|answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said
1|reproachfully: "How can you ask such a question?"
1|
1|"I have never enjoyed myself so much before!" she said, and Prince
1|Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
1|father and instantly dropped again. Natasha was happier than she had
1|ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one
1|becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the
1|possibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.
1|
1|At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the
1|position his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and
1|absent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing
1|by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one.
1|
1|On her way to supper Natasha passed him.
1|
1|Pierre's gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of
1|him. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of
1|her own happiness.
1|
1|"How delightful it is, Count!" said she. "Isn't it?"
1|
1|Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.
1|
1|"Yes, I am very glad," he said.
1|
1|"How can people be dissatisfied with anything?" thought Natasha.
1|"Especially such a capital fellow as Bezukhov!" In Natasha's eyes
1|all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people,
1|loving one another; none of them capable of injuring another--and so
1|they ought all to be happy.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not
1|dwell on it long. "Yes, it was a very brilliant ball," and then...
1|"Yes, that little Rostova is very charming. There's something fresh,
1|original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her." That
1|was all he thought about yesterday's ball, and after his morning tea
1|he set to work.
1|
1|But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for
1|work and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work,
1|as he often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.
1|
1|The visitor was Bitski, who served on various committees, frequented
1|all the societies in Petersburg, and a passionate devotee of the new
1|ideas and of Speranski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger--one of
1|those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to
1|the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest
1|partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into
1|Prince Andrew's room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking.
1|He had just heard particulars of that morning's sitting of the Council
1|of State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically.
1|The Emperor's speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such
1|as only constitutional monarchs deliver. "The Sovereign plainly said
1|that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the
1|government must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor
1|said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts
1|published," recounted Bitski, emphasizing certain words and opening
1|his eyes significantly.
1|
1|"Ah, yes! Today's events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our
1|history," he concluded.
1|
1|Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the
1|Council of State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which
1|he had attached such importance, and was surprised that this event,
1|now that it had taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite
1|insignificant. He listened with quiet irony to Bitski's enthusiastic
1|account of it. A very simple thought occurred to him: "What does it
1|matter to me or to Bitski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the
1|Council? Can all that make me any happier or better?"
1|
1|And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest
1|Prince Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to
1|dine that evening at Speranski's, "with only a few friends," as the
1|host had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the
1|intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested
1|Prince Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his
1|domestic surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.
1|
1|At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house
1|Speranski owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room
1|this small house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting
1|that of a monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the
1|friendly gathering of Speranski's intimate acquaintances already
1|assembled at five o'clock. There were no ladies present except
1|Speranski's little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her
1|governess. The other guests were Gervais, Magnitski, and Stolypin.
1|While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a
1|ringing staccato laugh--a laugh such as one hears on the stage.
1|Someone--it sounded like Speranski--was distinctly ejaculating
1|ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard Speranski's famous
1|laugh, and this ringing, high pitched laughter from a statesman made a
1|strange impression on him.
1|
1|He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing
1|between two windows at a small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres.
1|Speranski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast,
1|and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had
1|worn at the meeting of the Council of State, stood at the table with a
1|beaming countenance. His guests surrounded him. Magnitski,
1|addressing himself to Speranski, was relating an anecdote, and
1|Speranski was laughing in advance at what Magnitski was going to
1|say. When Prince Andrew entered the room Magnitski's words were
1|again crowned by laughter. Stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he
1|munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed softly with a
1|hissing chuckle, and Speranski in a high-pitched staccato manner.
1|
1|Still laughing, Speranski held out his soft white hand to Prince
1|Andrew.
1|
1|"Very pleased to see you, Prince," he said. "One moment..." he
1|went on, turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story. "We have
1|agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about
1|business!" and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment,
1|regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not
1|Speranski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared
1|mysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and
1|unattractive.
1|
1|At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed
1|to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before
1|Magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate
1|something still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the
1|state service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in
1|this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely
1|accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good
1|humored ridicule. Speranski related how at the Council that morning
1|a deaf dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so
1|too. Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable
1|for the stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolypin, stuttering,
1|broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the
1|abuses that existed under the former order of things--threatening to
1|give a serious turn to the conversation. Magnitski starting quizzing
1|Stolypin about his vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and
1|the talk reverted to its former lively tone.
1|
1|Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find
1|amusement in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his
1|wish, tried to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety
1|seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speranski's
1|high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter
1|grated on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and
1|feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company, but no
1|one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood.
1|They all seemed very gay.
1|
1|He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his
1|remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the
1|water, and he could not jest with them.
1|
1|There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was
1|witty and might have been funny, but it lacked just that something
1|which is the salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a
1|thing existed.
1|
1|After dinner Speranski's daughter and her governess rose. He
1|patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that
1|gesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.
1|
1|The men remained at table over their port--English fashion. In the
1|midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon's Spanish
1|affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to
1|express a contrary opinion. Speranski smiled and, with an evident wish
1|to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a
1|story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few
1|moments all were silent.
1|
1|Having sat some time at table, Speranski corked a bottle of wine
1|and, remarking, "Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,"
1|passed it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk
1|loudly went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier
1|were handed to Speranski and he took them to his study. As soon as
1|he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests
1|began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another.
1|
1|"Now for the recitation!" said Speranski on returning from his
1|study. "A wonderful talent!" he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnitski
1|immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses
1|in French which he had composed about various well-known Petersburg
1|people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When the
1|verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Speranski and took his
1|leave.
1|
1|"Where are you off to so early?" asked Speranski.
1|
1|"I promised to go to a reception."
1|
1|They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those
1|mirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of
1|him to have expected anything from Speranski and from any of his own
1|activities connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance
1|to what Speranski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang
1|in Prince Andrew's ears long after he had left the house.
1|
1|When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in
1|Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something
1|new. He recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of
1|his project of army reform, which had been accepted for
1|consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence
1|simply because another, a very poor one, had already been prepared and
1|submitted to the Emperor. He thought of the meetings of a committee of
1|which Berg was a member. He remembered how carefully and at what
1|length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at
1|those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that related to
1|the gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on the
1|Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of
1|the Roman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of
1|himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself Bogucharovo, his
1|occupations in the country, his journey to Ryazan; he remembered the
1|peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally applying to them the
1|Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he felt astonished
1|that he could have spent so much time on such useless work.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited
1|before, and among them at the Rostovs' with whom he had renewed
1|acquaintance at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness
1|which demanded the call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl
1|who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.
1|
1|Natasha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a
1|dark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier
1|than in her ball dress. She and all the Rostov family welcomed him
1|as an old friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he
1|had formerly judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of
1|excellent, simple, and kindly people. The old count's hospitality
1|and good nature, which struck one especially in Petersburg as a
1|pleasant surprise, were such that Prince Andrew could not refuse to
1|stay to dinner. "Yes," he thought, "they are capital people, who of
1|course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in
1|Natasha; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting
1|for this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!"
1|
1|In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
1|alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,
1|that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
1|already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no
1|longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered
1|it found in it a new enjoyment.
1|
1|After dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrew's request, went to the
1|clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window
1|talking to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he
1|ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had
1|thought impossible for him. He looked at Natasha as she sang, and
1|something new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the
1|same time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was
1|ready to weep. What about? His former love? The little princess? His
1|disillusionments?... His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The
1|chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the terrible contrast
1|between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that
1|limited and material something that he, and even she, was. This
1|contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang.
1|
1|As soon as Natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how
1|he liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling
1|that she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and
1|said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did.
1|
1|Prince Andrew left the Rostovs' late in the evening. He went to
1|bed from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having
1|lit his candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again
1|not at all troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and
1|joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into God's own
1|fresh air. It did not enter his head that he was in love with Natasha;
1|he was not thinking about her, but only picturing her to himself,
1|and in consequence all life appeared in a new light. "Why do I strive,
1|why do I toil in this narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with
1|all its joys, is open to me?" said he to himself. And for the first
1|time for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future.
1|He decided that he must attend to his son's education by finding a
1|tutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire
1|from the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and
1|Italy. "I must use my freedom while I feel so much strength and
1|youth in me," he said to himself. "Pierre was right when he said one
1|must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and
1|now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead, but while one
1|has life one must live and be happy!" thought he.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in
1|Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an
1|immaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed
1|forward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.
1|
1|"I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately
1|she could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more
1|fortunate with you," he said with a smile.
1|
1|"What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service."
1|
1|"I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count" (Berg said this
1|with perfect conviction that this information could not but be
1|agreeable), "and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own
1|and my wife's friends." (He smiled still more pleasantly.) "I wished
1|to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to
1|supper."
1|
1|Only Countess Helene, considering the society of such people as
1|the Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an
1|invitation. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at
1|his house a small but select company, and why this would give him
1|pleasure, and why though he grudged spending money on cards or
1|anything harmful, he was prepared to run into some expense for the
1|sake of good society--that Pierre could not refuse, and promised to
1|come.
1|
1|"But don't be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten
1|minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is
1|coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you
1|will do me the favor."
1|
1|Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at
1|the Bergs' house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.
1|
1|Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were
1|ready for their guests' arrival.
1|
1|In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and
1|pictures and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely
1|buttoned up in his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to
1|her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above
1|one, because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.
1|
1|"You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I
1|managed from my first promotion." (Berg measured his life not by years
1|but by promotions.) "My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only
1|waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to
1|be your husband." (He rose and kissed Vera's hand, and on the way to
1|her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) "And how
1|have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my
1|aquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious
1|and methodical."
1|
1|Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and
1|paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
1|woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man's dignity,
1|what it was ein Mann zu sein.* Vera at the same time smiling with a
1|sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the
1|same understood life wrongly, as according to Vera all men did.
1|Berg, judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. Vera,
1|judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation,
1|supposed that all men, though they understand nothing and are
1|conceited and selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.
1|
1|
1|*To be a man.
1|
1|
1|Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her
1|lace fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on
1|the lips.
1|
1|"The only thing is, we mustn't have children too soon," he
1|continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.
1|
1|"Yes," answered Vera, "I don't at all want that. We must live for
1|society."
1|
1|"Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this," said Berg,
1|pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.
1|
1|Just then Count Bezukhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced
1|at one another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally
1|claiming the honor of this visit.
1|
1|"This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances," thought
1|Berg. "This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself."
1|
1|"But please don't interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,"
1|said Vera, "because I know what interests each of them and what to say
1|to different people."
1|
1|Berg smiled again.
1|
1|"It can't be helped: men must sometimes have masculine
1|conversation," said he.
1|
1|They received Pierre in their small, new drawing-room, where it
1|was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,
1|neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange
1|that Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an
1|armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently
1|painfully undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor
1|to settle the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry
1|by moving a chair for himself, and Berg and Vera immediately began
1|their evening party, interrupting each other in their efforts to
1|entertain their guest.
1|
1|Vera, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be
1|entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once
1|began accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation
1|was required, interrupted his wife's remarks and touched on the
1|question of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the
1|general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made
1|him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had
1|declined them. Though the conversation was very incoherent and Vera
1|was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element, both husband
1|and wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only one guest was
1|present, their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas
1|to every other evening party with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.
1|
1|Before long Boris, Berg's old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of
1|condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vera. After
1|Boris came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the
1|Rostovs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
1|evening parties. Berg and Vera could not repress their smiles of
1|satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing
1|room, at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of
1|dresses, and the bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody
1|always has it, especially so the general, who admired the apartment,
1|patted Berg on the shoulder, and with parental authority superintended
1|the setting out of the table for boston. The general sat down by Count
1|Ilya Rostov, who was next to himself the most important guest. The old
1|people sat with the old, the young with the young, and the hostess
1|at the tea table, on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a
1|silver cake basket as the Panins had at their party. Everything was
1|just as it was everywhere else.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston
1|with Count Rostov, the general, and the colonel. At the card table
1|he happened to be directly facing Natasha, and was struck by a curious
1|change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and
1|not only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from
1|plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around.
1|
1|"What's the matter with her?" thought Pierre, glancing at her. She
1|was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without
1|looking at him, made some reply to Boris who sat down beside her.
1|After playing out a whole suit and to his partner's delight taking
1|five tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who
1|had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again
1|at Natasha.
1|
1|"What has happened to her?" he asked himself with still greater
1|surprise.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her
1|with a look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was
1|looking up at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid
1|breathing. And the bright glow of some inner fire that had been
1|suppressed was again alight in her. She was completely transformed and
1|from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball.
1|
1|Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and
1|youthful expression in his friend's face.
1|
1|Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now
1|with his back to Natasha and now facing her, but during the whole of
1|the six rubbers he watched her and his friend.
1|
1|"Something very important is happening between them," thought
1|Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him
1|and made him neglect the game.
1|
1|After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use
1|playing like that, and Pierre was released. Natasha on one side was
1|talking with Sonya and Boris, and Vera with a subtle smile was
1|saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and,
1|asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them.
1|Vera, having noticed Prince Andrew's attentions to Natasha, decided
1|that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the
1|tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when
1|Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about
1|feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest
1|as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ
1|her diplomatic tact.
1|
1|When Pierre went up to them he noticed that Vera was being carried
1|away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed
1|embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.
1|
1|"What do you think?" Vera was saying with an arch smile. "You are so
1|discerning, Prince, and understand people's characters so well at a
1|glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her
1|attachments? Could she, like other women" (Vera meant herself),
1|"love a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is
1|what I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?"
1|
1|"I know your sister too little," replied Prince Andrew, with a
1|sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, "to
1|be able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed
1|that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to
1|be," he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.
1|
1|"Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days," continued Vera--mentioning
1|"our days" as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing,
1|imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of
1|"our days" and that human characteristics change with the times--"in
1|our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted
1|often stifles real feeling in her. And it must be confessed that
1|Natalie is very susceptible." This return to the subject of Natalie
1|caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about
1|to rise, but Vera continued with a still more subtle smile:
1|
1|"I think no one has been more courted than she," she went on, "but
1|till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you
1|know, Count," she said to Pierre, "even our dear cousin Boris, who,
1|between ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness..."
1|(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).
1|
1|Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.
1|
1|"You are friendly with Boris, aren't you?" asked Vera.
1|
1|"Yes, I know him..."
1|
1|"I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natasha?"
1|
1|"Oh, there was childish love?" suddenly asked Prince Andrew,
1|blushing unexpectedly.
1|
1|"Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le
1|cousinage est un dangereux voisinage.* Don't you think so?"
1|
1|
1|*"Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood."
1|
1|
1|"Oh, undoubtedly!" said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural
1|liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very
1|careful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of
1|these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew
1|him aside.
1|
1|"Well?" asked Pierre, seeing his friend's strange animation with
1|surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Natasha as he rose.
1|
1|"I must... I must have a talk with you," said Prince Andrew. "You
1|know that pair of women's gloves?" (He referred to the Masonic
1|gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he
1|loved.) "I... but no, I will talk to you later on," and with a strange
1|light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew
1|approached Natasha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince
1|Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.
1|
1|But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he
1|should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
1|the affairs in Spain.
1|
1|Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his
1|face. The party was very successful and quite like other parties he
1|had seen. Everything was similar: the ladies' subtle talk, the
1|cards, the general raising his voice at the card table, and the
1|samovar and the tea cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had
1|always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate. They had
1|not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about
1|something important and clever. Now the general had begun such a
1|discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with
1|the Rostovs and spent the rest of the day there.
1|
1|Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came,
1|and without concealing it he tried to be with Natasha all day. Not
1|only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natasha,
1|but in the whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something
1|important that was bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and
1|sternly serious eyes at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natasha and
1|timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon
1|as he looked her way. Sonya was afraid to leave Natasha and afraid
1|of being in the way when she was with them. Natasha grew pale, in a
1|panic of expectation, when she remained alone with him for a moment.
1|Prince Andrew surprised her by his timidity. She felt that he wanted
1|to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so.
1|
1|In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to
1|Natasha and whispered: "Well, what?"
1|
1|"Mamma! For heaven's sake don't ask me anything now! One can't
1|talk about that," said Natasha.
1|
1|But all the same that night Natasha, now agitated and now
1|frightened, lay a long time in her mother's bed gazing straight
1|before her. She told her how he had complimented her, how he told
1|her he was going abroad, asked her where they were going to spend
1|the summer, and then how he had asked her about Boris.
1|
1|"But such a... such a... never happened to me before!" she said.
1|"Only I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I'm
1|with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that it's the real
1|thing? Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?"
1|
1|"No, my love; I am frightened myself," answered her mother. "Now
1|go!"
1|
1|"All the same I shan't sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!
1|Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before," she said,
1|surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. "And
1|could we ever have thought!..."
1|
1|It seemed to Natasha that even at the time she first saw Prince
1|Andrew at Otradnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she
1|feared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very
1|man she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and
1|of finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.
1|
1|"And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg
1|while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that
1|ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!
1|Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar."
1|
1|"What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them..."
1|said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince
1|Andrew had written in Natasha's album.
1|
1|"Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?"
1|
1|"Don't, Natasha! Pray to God. 'Marriages are made in heaven,'"
1|said her mother.
1|
1|"Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!" cried Natasha,
1|shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.
1|
1|At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and
1|telling him of his love for Natasha and his firm resolve to make her
1|his wife.
1|
1|That day Countess Helene had a reception at her house. The French
1|ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of
1|late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies
1|and gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the
1|rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and
1|morose air.
1|
1|Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous
1|depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the
1|intimacy of his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly
1|been made a gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had
1|begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark
1|thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than
1|before. At the same time the feeling he had noticed between his
1|protegee Natasha and Prince Andrew accentuated his gloom by the
1|contrast between his own position and his friend's. He tried equally
1|to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natasha and Prince Andrew;
1|and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with
1|eternity; again the question: for what? presented itself; and he
1|forced himself to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to
1|drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, after
1|he had left the countess' apartments, he was sitting upstairs in a
1|shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction of the
1|Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with
1|tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Ah, it's you!" said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.
1|"And I, you see, am hard at it." He pointed to his manuscript book
1|with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy
1|people look at their work.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life
1|on his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,
1|smiled at him with the egotism of joy.
1|
1|"Well, dear heart," said he, "I wanted to tell you about it
1|yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything
1|like it before. I am in love, my friend!"
1|
1|Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person
1|down on the sofa beside Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"With Natasha Rostova, yes?" said he.
1|
1|"Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,
1|but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and
1|suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in
1|the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can't live
1|without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why
1|don't you speak?"
1|
1|"I? I? What did I tell you?" said Pierre suddenly, rising and
1|beginning to pace up and down the room. "I always thought it....
1|That girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,
1|I entreat you, don't philosophize, don't doubt, marry, marry,
1|marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you."
1|
1|"But what of her?"
1|
1|"She loves you."
1|
1|"Don't talk rubbish..." said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into
1|Pierre's eyes.
1|
1|"She does, I know," Pierre cried fiercely.
1|
1|"But do listen," returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. "Do
1|you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone."
1|
1|"Well, go on, go on. I am very glad," said Pierre, and his face
1|really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to
1|Prince Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a
1|different, quite a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for
1|life, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he
1|made up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in
1|his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future,
1|said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father's caprice,
1|and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this
1|marriage and love her, or would do without his consent; then he
1|marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange,
1|apart from and independent of himself.
1|
1|"I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of
1|such love," said Prince Andrew. "It is not at all the same feeling
1|that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into
1|two halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the
1|other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom
1|and darkness...."
1|
1|"Darkness and gloom," reiterated Pierre: "yes, yes, I understand
1|that."
1|
1|"I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very
1|happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake."
1|
1|"Yes, yes," Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched
1|and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew's lot
1|appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIII
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew needed his father's consent to his marriage, and to
1|obtain this he started for the country next day.
1|
1|His father received his son's communication with external composure,
1|but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to
1|alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life
1|was already ending. "If only they would let me end my days as I want
1|to," thought the old man, "then they might do as they please." With
1|his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for
1|important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole
1|matter.
1|
1|In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
1|birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young
1|as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special
1|stress on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son
1|whom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. "Fourthly
1|and finally," the father said, looking ironically at his son, "I beg
1|you to put it off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as
1|you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your
1|love or passion or obstinacy--as you please--is still as great, marry!
1|And that's my last word on it. Mind, the last..." concluded the
1|prince, in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his
1|decision.
1|
1|Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his
1|feelings, or his fiancee's, would not stand a year's test, or that
1|he (the old prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to
1|conform to his father's wish--to propose, and postpone the wedding for
1|a year.
1|
1|Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostovs,
1|Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg.
1|
1|
1|Next day after her talk with her mother Natasha expected Bolkonski
1|all day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the
1|same. Pierre did not come either and Natasha, not knowing that
1|Prince Andrew had gone to see his father, could not explain his
1|absence to herself.
1|
1|Three weeks passed in this way. Natasha had no desire to go out
1|anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and
1|listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in
1|the evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed
1|to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing
1|at her and pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound
1|to her vanity intensified her misery.
1|
1|Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly
1|began to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not
1|know why it is being punished.
1|
1|The countess began to soothe Natasha, who after first listening to
1|her mother's words, suddenly interrupted her:
1|
1|"Leave off, Mamma! I don't think, and don't want to think about
1|it! He just came and then left off, left off..."
1|
1|Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and
1|went on quietly:
1|
1|"And I don't at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I
1|have now become quite calm, quite calm."
1|
1|The day after this conversation Natasha put on the old dress which
1|she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
1|mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she
1|had abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went
1|to the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud
1|resonance, and began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished
1|her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and
1|sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her. She listened
1|joyfully (as though she had not expected it) to the charm of the notes
1|reverberating, filling the whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying
1|away; and all at once she felt cheerful. "What's the good of making so
1|much of it? Things are nice as it is," she said to herself, and she
1|began walking up and down the room, not stepping simply on the
1|resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the
1|toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening to the
1|regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to
1|the sounds of her own voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it.
1|"There, that's me!" the expression of her face seemed to say as she
1|caught sight of herself. "Well, and very nice too! I need nobody."
1|
1|A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room
1|but she would not let him, and having closed the door behind him
1|continued her walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite
1|mood--love of, and delight in, herself. "How charming that Natasha
1|is!" she said again, speaking as some third, collective, male
1|person. "Pretty, a good voice, young, and in nobody's way if only they
1|leave her in peace." But however much they left her in peace she could
1|not now be at peace, and immediately felt this.
1|
1|In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, "At home?" and
1|then footsteps were heard. Natasha was looking at the mirror, but
1|did not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When
1|she saw herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for
1|certain, though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.
1|
1|Pale and agitated, Natasha ran into the drawing room.
1|
1|"Mamma! Bolkonski has come!" she said. "Mamma, it is awful, it is
1|unbearable! I don't want... to be tormented? What am I to do?..."
1|
1|Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room
1|with an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natasha his
1|face brightened. He kissed the countess' hand and Natasha's, and sat
1|down beside the sofa.
1|
1|"It is long since we had the pleasure..." began the countess, but
1|Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,
1|obviously in haste to say what he had to.
1|
1|"I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
1|father's. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I
1|only got back last night," he said glancing at Natasha; "I want to
1|have a talk with you, Countess," he added after a moment's pause.
1|
1|The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.
1|
1|"I am at your disposal," she murmured.
1|
1|Natasha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:
1|something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared
1|straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.
1|
1|"At once? This instant!... No, it can't be!" she thought.
1|
1|Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she
1|was not mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be
1|decided.
1|
1|"Go, Natasha! I will call you," said the countess in a whisper.
1|
1|Natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew
1|and at her mother and went out.
1|
1|"I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter's hand," said
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|The countess' face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.
1|
1|"Your offer..." she began at last sedately. He remained silent,
1|looking into her eyes. "Your offer..." (she grew confused) "is
1|agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband...
1|I hope... but it will depend on her...."
1|
1|"I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it
1|to me?" said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Yes," replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and
1|with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips
1|to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him
1|as a son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man.
1|"I am sure my husband will consent," said the countess, "but your
1|father..."
1|
1|"My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express
1|condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
1|year. And I wished to tell you of that," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"It is true that Natasha is still young, but--so long as that?..."
1|
1|"It is unavoidable," said Prince Andrew with a sigh.
1|
1|"I will send her to you," said the countess, and left the room.
1|
1|"Lord have mercy upon us!" she repeated while seeking her daughter.
1|
1|Sonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom. Natasha was sitting on
1|the bed, pale and dry eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering
1|something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped
1|up and flew to her.
1|
1|"Well, Mamma?... Well?..."
1|
1|"Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand," said the countess,
1|coldly it seemed to Natasha. "Go... go," said the mother, sadly and
1|reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.
1|
1|Natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When
1|she came in and saw him she paused. "Is it possible that this stranger
1|has now become everything to me?" she asked herself, and immediately
1|answered, "Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than
1|everything in the world." Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast
1|eyes.
1|
1|"I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?"
1|
1|He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned
1|expression of her face. Her face said: "Why ask? Why doubt what you
1|cannot but know? Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?"
1|
1|She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.
1|
1|"Do you love me?"
1|
1|"Yes, yes!" Natasha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed
1|loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.
1|
1|"What is it? What's the matter?"
1|
1|"Oh, I am so happy!" she replied, smiled through her tears, bent
1|over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether
1|she might, and then kissed him.
1|
1|Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find
1|in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly
1|changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
1|desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness,
1|fear at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful
1|sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present
1|feeling, though not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger
1|and more serious.
1|
1|"Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?" asked
1|Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.
1|
1|"Is it possible that I--the 'chit of a girl,' as everybody called
1|me," thought Natasha--"is it possible that I am now to be the wife and
1|the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father
1|looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no
1|more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies
1|a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he
1|ask me?"
1|
1|"No," she replied, but she had not understood his question.
1|
1|"Forgive me!" he said. "But you are so young, and I have already
1|been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know
1|yourself."
1|
1|Natasha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing
1|to take in the meaning of his words.
1|
1|"Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be," continued
1|Prince Andrew, "it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask
1|you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall
1|remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or
1|should you come to love..." said Prince Andrew with an unnatural
1|smile.
1|
1|"Why do you say that?" Natasha interrupted him. "You know that
1|from the very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you," she
1|cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.
1|
1|"In a year you will learn to know yourself...."
1|
1|"A whole year!" Natasha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that
1|the marriage was to be postponed for a year. "But why a year? Why a
1|year?..."
1|
1|Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.
1|Natasha did not hear him.
1|
1|"And can't it be helped?" she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,
1|but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.
1|
1|"It's awful! Oh, it's awful! awful!" Natasha suddenly cried, and
1|again burst into sobs. "I shall die, waiting a year: it's
1|impossible, it's awful!" She looked into her lover's face and saw in
1|it a look of commiseration and perplexity.
1|
1|"No, no! I'll do anything!" she said, suddenly checking her tears.
1|"I am so happy."
1|
1|The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed
1|couple their blessing.
1|
1|From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostovs' as
1|Natasha's affianced lover.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIV
1|
1|
1|No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha's engagement to
1|Bolkonski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said
1|that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole
1|burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever,
1|but that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom.
1|If after six months she felt that she did not love him she would
1|have full right to reject him. Naturally neither Natasha nor her
1|parents wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came
1|every day to the Rostovs', but did not behave to Natasha as an
1|affianced lover: he did not use the familiar thou, but said you to
1|her, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement, quite
1|different, intimate, and natural relations sprang up between them.
1|It was as if they had not known each other till now. Both liked to
1|recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were
1|nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite different
1|beings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere. At first
1|the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew;
1|he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time Natasha
1|trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all
1|that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all of
1|them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to
1|be. After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without
1|restraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he
1|took his part. He could talk about rural economy with the count,
1|fashions with the countess and Natasha, and about albums and fancywork
1|with Sonya. Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his
1|presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the
1|evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew's coming to Otradnoe
1|and their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natasha and
1|Prince Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and
1|Andrew's encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents
1|betokening that it had to be.
1|
1|In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
1|accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting
1|together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and
1|go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely
1|spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to
1|speak of it. Natasha shared this as she did all his feelings, which
1|she constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his
1|son. Prince Andrew blushed, as he often did now--Natasha
1|particularly liked it in him--and said that his son would not live
1|with them.
1|
1|"Why not?" asked Natasha in a frightened tone.
1|
1|"I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides..."
1|
1|"How I should have loved him!" said Natasha, immediately guessing
1|his thought; "but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding
1|fault with us."
1|
1|Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask
1|his advice about Petya's education or Nicholas' service. The old
1|countess sighed as she looked at them; Sonya was always getting
1|frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for
1|leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew
1|spoke (he could tell a story very well), Natasha listened to him
1|with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed
1|attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in
1|perplexity: "What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover
1|something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?"
1|Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic
1|of her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince
1|Andrew laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned
1|himself entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always
1|felt nearer to him. Natasha would have been completely happy if the
1|thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not
1|terrified her, just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and
1|cold.
1|
1|On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought
1|with him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostovs' once since the ball.
1|Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the
1|countess, and Natasha sat down beside a little chess table with Sonya,
1|thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.
1|
1|"You have known Bezukhov a long time?" he asked. "Do you like him?"
1|
1|"Yes, he's a dear, but very absurd."
1|
1|And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of
1|his absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.
1|
1|"Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known
1|him from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,"
1|Prince Andrew said with sudden seriousness--"I am going away and
1|heaven knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know
1|I am not to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when
1|I am not here..."
1|
1|"What can happen?"
1|
1|"Whatever trouble may come," Prince Andrew continued, "I beg you,
1|Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for
1|advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but
1|he has a heart of gold."
1|
1|Neither her father, nor her mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrew
1|himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would
1|act on Natasha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that
1|day, dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not
1|understanding what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking
1|leave, he kissed her hand for the last time. "Don't go!" she said in a
1|tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and
1|which he remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone;
1|but for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no
1|interest in anything and only saying now and then, "Oh, why did he
1|go away?"
1|
1|But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around
1|her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and
1|became her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy,
1|as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of
1|face.

1|CHAPTER XXV
1|
1|
1|During that year after his son's departure, Prince Nicholas
1|Bolkonski's health and temper became much worse. He grew still more
1|irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of
1|his frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out
1|her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.
1|Princess Mary had two passions and consequently two joys--her
1|nephew, little Nicholas, and religion--and these were the favorite
1|subjects of the prince's attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken
1|of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or
1|the petting and spoiling of children. "You want to make him"--little
1|Nicholas--"into an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants
1|a son and not an old maid," he would say. Or, turning to
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary's presence
1|how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.
1|
1|He continually hurt Princess Mary's feelings and tormented her,
1|but it cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame
1|toward her, or could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of
1|it all, be unjust? And what is justice? The princess never thought
1|of that proud word "justice." All the complex laws of man centered for
1|her in one clear and simple law--the law of love and self-sacrifice
1|taught us by Him who lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself
1|was God. What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other
1|people? She had to endure and love, and that she did.
1|
1|During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had
1|been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known
1|him for a long time past. She felt that something had happened to him,
1|but he said nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a
1|long talk with his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed
1|that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another.
1|
1|Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend
1|Julie Karagina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls
1|dream) of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in
1|mourning for her own brother, killed in Turkey.
1|
1|
1|Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.
1|
1|Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a
1|special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your
1|excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can--I
1|will not say comfort us--but save us from despair. Religion alone can
1|explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what
1|cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life--not merely
1|harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others--are called away
1|to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden
1|to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I saw, and
1|one I shall never forget--that of my dear sister-in-law--left that
1|impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had
1|to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged
1|anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to
1|die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since
1|then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly
1|why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression of
1|the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though
1|generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite
1|love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically
1|innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother's duties. As a
1|young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so as
1|a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince
1|Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will
1|there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of
1|her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
1|influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at
1|the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should
1|then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and
1|certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you of
1|the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a
1|single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is
1|governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for
1|our good.
1|
1|You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my
1|wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You
1|will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte!
1|The case is this: my father's health is growing noticeably worse, he
1|cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This
1|irritability is, as you know, chiefly directed to political questions.
1|He cannot endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal
1|terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own,
1|the grandson of the Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite
1|indifferent to politics, but from my father's remarks and his talks
1|with Michael Ivanovich I know all that goes on in the world and
1|especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who only at
1|Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a great
1|man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand this.
1|It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views
1|that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he
1|foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing
1|his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive
1|from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes
1|about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will be
1|decided very shortly.
1|
1|Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother
1|Andrew's absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much
1|of late. After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his
1|spirits. He has again become as I used to know him when a child: kind,
1|affectionate, with that heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has
1|realized, it seems to me, that life is not over for him. But
1|together with this mental change he has grown physically much
1|weaker. He has become thinner and more nervous. I am anxious about him
1|and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended
1|long ago. I hope it will cure him. You write that in Petersburg he
1|is spoken of as one of the most active, cultivated, and capable of the
1|young men. Forgive my vanity as a relation, but I never doubted it.
1|The good he has done to everybody here, from his peasants up to the
1|gentry, is incalculable. On his arrival in Petersburg he received only
1|his due. I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to
1|Moscow, especially such false ones as that you write about--I mean the
1|report of my brother's betrothal to the little Rostova. I do not think
1|my brother will ever marry again, and certainly not her; and this is
1|why: first, I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he
1|has lost, the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for
1|him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a
1|stepmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that girl is not the
1|kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew. I do not think he would
1|choose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish it. But I am
1|running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet. Good-by,
1|my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty care. My
1|dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.

1|CHAPTER XXVI
1|
1|
1|In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected
1|letter from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her
1|strange and surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to
1|Natasha Rostova. The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his
1|betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister. He
1|wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he
1|understand and know what life was. He asked his sister to forgive
1|him for not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited
1|Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his father. He had not
1|done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her father to give his
1|consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his
1|displeasure without attaining her object. "Besides," he wrote, "the
1|matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now. My father then
1|insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months, half of that
1|period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever. If the
1|doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia,
1|but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You know
1|me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have
1|been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and
1|arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a
1|short time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him
1|about the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand
1|him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and
1|whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four
1|months."
1|
1|After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave
1|the letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her
1|quietly:
1|
1|"Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won't
1|be long--I shall soon set him free."
1|
1|The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her
1|speak and, raising his voice more and more, cried:
1|
1|"Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,
1|eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell
1|him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little
1|Nicholas' stepmother and I'll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He
1|mustn't be without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more
1|women are wanted in my house--let him marry and live by himself.
1|Perhaps you will go and live with him too?" he added, turning to
1|Princess Mary. "Go in heavens name! Go out into the frost... the
1|frost... the frost!"
1|
1|After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the
1|matter. But repressed vexation at his son's poor-spirited behavior
1|found expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former
1|pretexts for irony a fresh one was now added--allusions to stepmothers
1|and amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
1|
1|"Why shouldn't I marry her?" he asked his daughter. "She'll make a
1|splendid princess!"
1|
1|And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary
1|noticed that her father was really associating more and more with
1|the Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his
1|letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to
1|the idea.
1|
1|Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion
1|were Princess Mary's joys and consolations; but besides that, since
1|everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest
1|depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the
1|chief consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were
1|given her by God's folk--the half-witted and other pilgrims who
1|visited her without the prince's knowledge. The longer she lived, the
1|more experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her
1|wonder at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and
1|happiness here on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming
1|one another, to obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness.
1|Prince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough:
1|he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman. Her father objected
1|to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for
1|Andrew. And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another
1|and injured their souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of
1|benefits which endure but for an instant. Not only do we know this
1|ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth and told us
1|that this life is but for a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to
1|it and think to find happiness in it. "How is it that no one realizes
1|this?" thought Princess Mary. "No one except these despised God's folk
1|who, wallet on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen
1|by the prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of
1|causing him to sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of
1|worldly welfare, in order without clinging to anything to wander in
1|hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name, doing no one
1|any harm but praying for all--for those who drive one away as well as
1|for those who protect one: higher than that life and truth there is no
1|life or truth!"
1|
1|There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty
1|called Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot
1|and worn heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her.
1|Once, when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia
1|was talking of her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found
1|the true path of life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force
1|that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone
1|to sleep Princess Mary thought about this for a long time, and at last
1|made up her mind that, strange as it might seem, she must go on a
1|pilgrimage. She disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor,
1|Father Akinfi, the monk, and he approved of her intention. Under guise
1|of a present for the pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim's
1|complete costume for herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough
1|coat, and a black kerchief. Often, approaching the chest of drawers
1|containing this secret treasure, Princess Mary paused, uncertain
1|whether the time had not already come to put her project into
1|execution.
1|
1|Often, listening to the pilgrims' tales, she was so stimulated by
1|their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep
1|meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning
1|everything and running away from home. In imagination she already
1|pictured herself by Theodosia's side, dressed in coarse rags,
1|walking with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road,
1|directing her wanderings from one saint's shrine to another, free from
1|envy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where
1|there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.
1|
1|"I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to
1|get used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on
1|till my legs fail, and I'll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at
1|last reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow
1|nor sighing..." thought Princess Mary.
1|
1|But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko
1|(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that
1|she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.

1|BOOK SEVEN: 1810 --11
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor--idleness--was a
1|condition of the first man's blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man
1|has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not
1|only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but
1|because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at
1|ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If
1|man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was
1|fulfilling his duty, he would have found one of the conditions of
1|man's primitive blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and
1|irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class--the military. The
1|chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in
1|this compulsory and irreproachable idleness.
1|
1|Nicholas Rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full
1|when, after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pavlograd regiment,
1|in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from
1|Denisov.
1|
1|Rostov had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow
1|acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked
1|and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was
1|well contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters
1|from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their
1|affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder, and that it
1|was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents.
1|
1|Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to
1|take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the
1|entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt
1|that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life,
1|with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its
1|accounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society,
1|and with Sonya's love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully
1|difficult and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold,
1|formal letters in French, beginning: "My dear Mamma," and ending:
1|"Your obedient son," which said nothing of when he would return. In
1|1810 he received letters from his parents, in which they told him of
1|Natasha's engagement to Bolkonski, and that the wedding would be in
1|a year's time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter
1|grieved and mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that
1|Natasha, for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family,
1|should be lost to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of
1|view, he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow
1|Bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after
1|all, and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with permission
1|from his dotard father. For a moment he hesitated whether he should
1|not apply for leave in order to see Natasha before she was married,
1|but then came the maneuvers, and considerations about Sonya and
1|about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off.
1|But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his
1|mother, written without his father's knowledge, and that letter
1|persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take
1|matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and
1|they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and
1|trusted Mitenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody
1|took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. "For
1|God's sake, I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make
1|me and the whole family wretched," wrote the countess.
1|
1|This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a
1|matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.
1|
1|The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any
1|rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but
1|after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely
1|vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and
1|when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka
1|(Denisov's servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who
1|turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was
1|going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he
1|would go away without having heard from the staff--and this interested
1|him extremely--whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive
1|the Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to
1|think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the
1|Polish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had
1|betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it
1|seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish
1|Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had
1|given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would
1|take place without him--he knew he must go away from this good, bright
1|world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week
1|later he obtained his leave. His hussar comrades--not only those of
1|his own regiment, but the whole brigade--gave Rostov a dinner to which
1|the subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were
1|two bands and two choirs of singers. Rostov danced the Trepak with
1|Major Basov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped
1|Rostov; the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted
1|"hurrah!" and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as
1|far as the first post station.
1|
1|During the first half of the journey--from Kremenchug to Kiev--all
1|Rostov's thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with
1|the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to
1|forget his three roans and Dozhoyveyko, his quartermaster, and to
1|wonder anxiously how things would be at Otradnoe and what he would
1|find there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached
1|it--far stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law
1|by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the
1|square of the distance. At the last post station before Otradnoe he
1|gave the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran
1|breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.
1|
1|After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of
1|unsatisfied expectation--the feeling that "everything is just the
1|same, so why did I hurry?"--Nicholas began to settle down in his old
1|home world. His father and mother were much the same, only a little
1|older. What was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional
1|discord, which there used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found
1|out, was due to the bad state of their affairs. Sonya was nearly
1|twenty; she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more
1|than she was already, but that was enough. She exhaled happiness and
1|love from the time Nicholas returned, and the faithful, unalterable
1|love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him. Petya and Natasha
1|surprised Nicholas most. Petya was a big handsome boy of thirteen,
1|merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking.
1|As for Natasha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed
1|whenever he looked at her.
1|
1|"You're not the same at all," he said.
1|
1|"How? Am I uglier?"
1|
1|"On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!" he whispered to
1|her.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, yes!" cried Natasha, joyfully.
1|
1|She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit
1|to Otradnoe and showed him his last letter.
1|
1|"Well, are you glad?" Natasha asked. "I am so tranquil and happy
1|now."
1|
1|"Very glad," answered Nicholas. "He is an excellent fellow.... And
1|are you very much in love?"
1|
1|"How shall I put it?" replied Natasha. "I was in love with Boris,
1|with my teacher, and with Denisov, but this is quite different. I feel
1|at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists, and
1|I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before."
1|
1|Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the
1|marriage for a year; but Natasha attacked her brother with
1|exasperation, proving to him that it could not be otherwise, and
1|that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the father's
1|will, and that she herself wished it so.
1|
1|"You don't at all understand," she said.
1|
1|Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.
1|
1|Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem
1|at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband.
1|She was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This
1|amazed Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkonski's courtship
1|skeptically. He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially
1|as he had not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him
1|that there was something not quite right about this intended marriage.
1|
1|"Why this delay? Why no betrothal?" he thought. Once, when he had
1|touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his
1|surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her
1|soul she too had doubts about this marriage.
1|
1|"You see he writes," said she, showing her son a letter of Prince
1|Andrew's, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
1|daughter's future married happiness, "he writes that he won't come
1|before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His
1|health is very delicate. Don't tell Natasha. And don't attach
1|importance to her being so bright: that's because she's living through
1|the last days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every
1|time we receive a letter from him! However, God grant that
1|everything turns out well!" (She always ended with these words.) "He
1|is an excellent man!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull.
1|He was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid
1|business matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw
1|off this burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his
1|arrival he went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as
1|to where he was going, to Mitenka's lodge and demanded an account of
1|everything. But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew
1|even less than the frightened and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation
1|and the examination of the accounts with Mitenka did not last long.
1|The village elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were
1|waiting in the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young
1|count's voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and
1|then words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.
1|
1|"Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I'll hack the dog to pieces! I'm
1|not my father!... Robbing us!..." and so on.
1|
1|Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red
1|in the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff
1|of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great
1|agility at convenient moments between the words, shouting, "Be off!
1|Never let me see your face here again, you villain!"
1|
1|Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
1|shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for
1|culprits at Otradnoe. Mitenka himself, returning tipsy from the
1|town, used to hide there, and many of the residents at Otradnoe,
1|hiding from Mitenka, knew of its protective qualities.)
1|
1|Mitenka's wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and
1|frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar
1|was boiling and where the steward's high bedstead stood with its
1|patchwork quilt.
1|
1|The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by
1|with resolute strides and went into the house.
1|
1|The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened
1|at the lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would
1|certainly improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect
1|this excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his
1|door on tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.
1|
1|Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed
1|smile, said to him:
1|
1|"But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you got excited! Mitenka has
1|told me all about it."
1|
1|"I knew," thought Nicholas, "that I should never understand anything
1|in this crazy world."
1|
1|"You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they
1|were carried forward--and you did not look at the other page."
1|
1|"Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have
1|done, I have done; but, if you like, I won't speak to him again."
1|
1|"No, my dear boy" (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he
1|had mismanaged his wife's property and was to blame toward his
1|children, but he did not know how to remedy it). "No, I beg you to
1|attend to the business. I am old. I..."
1|
1|"No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I
1|understand it all less than you do."
1|
1|"Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings
1|forward from page to page," he thought. "I used to understand what a
1|'corner' and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to
1|another page I don't understand at all," said he to himself, and after
1|that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess
1|called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from
1|Anna Mikhaylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he
1|thought of doing with it.
1|
1|"This," answered Nicholas. "You say it rests with me. Well, I
1|don't like Anna Mikhaylovna and I don't like Boris, but they were
1|our friends and poor. Well then, this!" and he tore up the note, and
1|by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After
1|that, young Rostov took no further part in any business affairs, but
1|devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new
1|pursuit--the chase--for which his father kept a large establishment.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts
1|congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had
1|thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the
1|brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle, and
1|against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat. The wooded
1|ravines and the copses, which at the end of August had still been
1|green islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden and
1|bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had already
1|half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to
1|scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best
1|time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young
1|sportsman Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but
1|were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give
1|them a three days' rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go
1|on a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was
1|an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.
1|
1|All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the
1|air was sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began
1|to thaw. On the fifteenth, when young Rostov, in his dressing gown,
1|looked out of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for
1|hunting: it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth
1|without any wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping,
1|microscopic particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the
1|garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly
1|fallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black
1|and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into
1|the dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy
1|porch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a
1|black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got
1|up on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a
1|hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and
1|mustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the
1|garden path, arched his back and, rushing headlong toward the porch
1|with lifted tail, began rubbing himself against his legs.
1|
1|"O-hoy!" came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman's call
1|which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round
1|the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,
1|wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian
1|fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence
1|and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his
1|Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This
1|scorn was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,
1|disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all
1|the same his serf and huntsman.
1|
1|"Daniel!" Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the
1|weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away
1|by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all
1|his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his
1|mistress.
1|
1|"What orders, your excellency?" said the huntsman in his deep
1|bass, deep as a proto-deacon's and hoarse with hallooing--and two
1|flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who
1|was silent. "Can you resist it?" those eyes seemed to be asking.
1|
1|"It's a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?" asked
1|Nicholas, scratching Milka behind the ears.
1|
1|Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.
1|
1|"I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen," his bass boomed out after a
1|minute's pause. "He says she's moved them into the Otradnoe enclosure.
1|They were howling there." (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom
1|they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otradnoe copse, a small
1|place a mile and a half from the house.)
1|
1|"We ought to go, don't you think so?" said Nicholas. "Come to me
1|with Uvarka."
1|
1|"As you please."
1|
1|"Then put off feeding them."
1|
1|"Yes, sir."
1|
1|Five minutes later Daniel and Uvarka were standing in Nicholas'
1|big study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was
1|like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
1|surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual
1|stood just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for
1|fear of breaking something in the master's apartment, and he
1|hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that
1|ceiling, out into the open under the sky once more.
1|
1|Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion
1|that the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting),
1|Nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was
1|about to go Natasha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her
1|hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse's big shawl wrapped
1|round her. Petya ran in at the same time.
1|
1|"You are going?" asked Natasha. "I knew you would! Sonya said you
1|wouldn't go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you
1|couldn't help going."
1|
1|"Yes, we are going," replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as
1|he intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natasha and
1|Petya. "We are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for
1|you."
1|
1|"You know it is my greatest pleasure," said Natasha. "It's not fair;
1|you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said
1|nothing to us about it."
1|
1|"'No barrier bars a Russian's path'--we'll go!" shouted Petya.
1|
1|"But you can't. Mamma said you mustn't," said Nicholas to Natasha.
1|
1|"Yes, I'll go. I shall certainly go," said Natasha decisively.
1|"Daniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my
1|dogs," she added to the huntsman.
1|
1|It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but
1|to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible.
1|He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his
1|business, careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on
1|the young lady.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting
1|establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son's
1|care, being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September,
1|prepared to go out with the others.
1|
1|In an hour's time the whole hunting party was at the porch.
1|Nicholas, with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no
1|time for attending to trifles, went past Natasha and Petya who were
1|trying to tell him something. He had a look at all the details of
1|the hunt, sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the
1|quarry, mounted his chestnut Donets, and whistling to his own leash of
1|borzois, set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the
1|Otradnoe wood. The old count's horse, a sorrel gelding called
1|Viflyanka, was led by the groom in attendance on him, while the
1|count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved
1|for him.
1|
1|They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and
1|whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen and
1|more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash
1|belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and
1|thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.
1|
1|Each dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his
1|business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the
1|fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,
1|along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert.
1|
1|The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and
1|then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky
1|still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the
1|air was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a
1|huntsman, the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a
1|straggling hound could be heard.
1|
1|When they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders
1|with dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostovs. In
1|front rode a fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray
1|mustache.
1|
1|"Good morning, Uncle!" said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.
1|
1|"That's it. Come on!... I was sure of it," began "Uncle." (He was
1|a distant relative of the Rostovs', a man of small means, and their
1|neighbor.) "I knew you wouldn't be able to resist it and it's a good
1|thing you're going. That's it! Come on! (This was "Uncle's" favorite
1|expression.) "Take the covert at once, for my Girchik says the Ilagins
1|are at Korniki with their hounds. That's it. Come on!... They'll
1|take the cubs from under your very nose."
1|
1|"That's where I'm going. Shall we join up our packs?" asked
1|Nicholas.
1|
1|The hounds were joined into one pack, and "Uncle" and Nicholas
1|rode on side by side. Natasha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide
1|her eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed
1|by Petya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and
1|by a groom appointed to look after her. Petya, who was laughing,
1|whipped and pulled at his horse. Natasha sat easily and confidently on
1|her black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.
1|
1|"Uncle" looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha. He did not
1|like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.
1|
1|"Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!" shouted Petya.
1|
1|"Good morning, good morning! But don't go overriding the hounds,"
1|said "Uncle" sternly.
1|
1|"Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunila is! He knew me," said Natasha,
1|referring to her favorite hound.
1|
1|"In the first place, Trunila is not a 'dog,' but a harrier," thought
1|Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel
1|the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Natasha
1|understood it.
1|
1|"You mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way, Uncle," she said.
1|"We'll go to our places and won't budge."
1|
1|"A good thing too, little countess," said "Uncle," "only mind you
1|don't fall off your horse," he added, "because--that's it, come
1|on!--you've nothing to hold on to."
1|
1|The oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards
1|off, the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rostov, having finally
1|settled with "Uncle" where they should set on the hounds, and having
1|shown Natasha where she was to stand--a spot where nothing could
1|possibly run out--went round above the ravine.
1|
1|"Well, nephew, you're going for a big wolf," said "Uncle." "Mind and
1|don't let her slip!"
1|
1|"That's as may happen," answered Rostov. "Karay, here!" he
1|shouted, answering "Uncle's" remark by this call to his borzoi.
1|Karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having
1|tackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.
1|
1|The old count, knowing his son's ardor in the hunt, hurried so as
1|not to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when
1|Count Ilya Rostov, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove
1|up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for
1|him, where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and
1|fastened on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek,
1|well-fed, and comfortable horse, Viflyanka, which was turning gray,
1|like himself. His horses and trap were sent home. Count Ilya Rostov,
1|though not at heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well,
1|and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged
1|his reins, settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was
1|ready, looked about with a smile.
1|
1|Beside him was Simon Chekmar, his personal attendant, an old
1|horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekmar held in leash three
1|formidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master
1|and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred
1|paces farther along the edge of the wood stood Mitka, the count's
1|other groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the
1|hunt, by old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled
1|brandy, taken a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his
1|favorite Bordeaux.
1|
1|He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were
1|rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his
1|saddle, wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out
1|for an outing.
1|
1|The thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmar, having got everything ready,
1|kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of
1|terms for thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in
1|expected a pleasant chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through
1|the wood (it was plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind
1|the count. This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman's
1|cloak, with a tall peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who
1|went by a woman's name, Nastasya Ivanovna.
1|
1|"Well, Nastasya Ivanovna!" whispered the count, winking at him.
1|"If you scare away the beast, Daniel'll give it you!"
1|
1|"I know a thing or two myself!" said Nastasya Ivanovna.
1|
1|"Hush!" whispered the count and turned to Simon. "Have you seen
1|the young countess?" he asked. "Where is she?"
1|
1|"With young Count Peter, by the Zharov rank grass," answered
1|Simon, smiling. "Though she's a lady, she's very fond of hunting."
1|
1|"And you're surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?" said the
1|count. "She's as good as many a man!"
1|
1|"Of course! It's marvelous. So bold, so easy!"
1|
1|"And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyadov upland, isn't he?"
1|
1|"Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so
1|well that Daniel and I are often quite astounded," said Simon, well
1|knowing what would please his master.
1|
1|"Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?"
1|
1|"A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
1|Zavarzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight
1|when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand
1|rubles and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search
1|far to find another as smart."
1|
1|"To search far..." repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not
1|said more. "To search far," he said, turning back the skirt of his
1|coat to get at his snuffbox.
1|
1|"The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael
1|Sidorych..." Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had
1|distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three
1|hounds giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a
1|warning finger at his master. "They are on the scent of the cubs..."
1|he whispered, "straight to the Lyadov uplands."
1|
1|The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked
1|into the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space,
1|holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry
1|of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel's
1|hunting horn; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be
1|heard in full cry, with that peculiar lift in the note that
1|indicates that they are after a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on
1|the hounds, but changed to the cry of ulyulyu, and above the others
1|rose Daniel's voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice
1|seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open
1|field.
1|
1|After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his
1|attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into
1|two packs: the sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue,
1|began to die away in the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood
1|past the count, and it was with this that Daniel's voice was heard
1|calling ulyulyu. The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart
1|again, but both were becoming more distant.
1|
1|Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi
1|had entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in
1|his hand, opened it and took a pinch. "Back!" cried Simon to a
1|borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and
1|dropped the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted to pick it up.
1|The count and Simon were looking at him.
1|
1|Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly
1|approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were
1|just in front of them.
1|
1|The count turned and saw on his right Mitka staring at him with eyes
1|starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to
1|the other side.
1|
1|"Look out!" he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had
1|long fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he
1|galloped toward the count.
1|
1|The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
1|wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet
1|lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.
1|The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
1|horses' feet at the wolf.
1|
1|The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs
1|awkwardly, like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly
1|swaying from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish
1|of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same
1|instant, with a cry like a wail, first one hound, then another, and
1|then another, sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the
1|whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf
1|had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and
1|Daniel's chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long back
1|sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his disheveled gray hair hanging
1|over his flushed, perspiring face.
1|
1|"Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!..." he cried. When he caught sight of the
1|count his eyes flashed lightning.
1|
1|"Blast you!" he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the
1|count.
1|
1|"You've let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!" and as if scorning to
1|say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving
1|flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count
1|had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a
1|punished schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon's
1|sympathy for his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was
1|galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both
1|sides, all trying to head the wolf, but it vanished into the wood
1|before they could do so.
1|
1|

1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the
1|wolf. By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of
1|the dogs whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of
1|the huntsmen approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was
1|happening at the copse. He knew that young and old wolves were
1|there, that the hounds had separated into two packs, that somewhere
1|a wolf was being chased, and that something had gone wrong. He
1|expected the wolf to come his way any moment. He made thousands of
1|different conjectures as to where and from what side the beast would
1|come and how he would set upon it. Hope alternated with despair.
1|Several times he addressed a prayer to God that the wolf should come
1|his way. He prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with
1|which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial
1|causes. "What would it be to Thee to do this for me?" he said to
1|God. "I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee,
1|but for God's sake do let the old wolf come my way and let Karay
1|spring at it--in sight of 'Uncle' who is watching from over there--and
1|seize it by the throat in a death grip!" A thousand times during
1|that half-hour Rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of
1|the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth
1|and the gully with its water-worn side and "Uncle's" cap just
1|visible above the bush on his right.
1|
1|"No, I shan't have such luck," thought Rostov, "yet what wouldn't it
1|be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am
1|always unlucky." Memories of Austerlitz and of Dolokhov flashed
1|rapidly and clearly through his mind. "Only once in my life to get
1|an old wolf, I want only that!" thought he, straining eyes and ears
1|and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the
1|slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.
1|
1|Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him
1|across the deserted field. "No, it can't be!" thought Rostov, taking a
1|deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped
1|for. The height of happiness was reached--and so simply, without
1|warning, or noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his
1|eyes and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and
1|jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path. She was an old
1|animal with a gray back and big reddish belly. She ran without
1|hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw her. Rostov, holding his
1|breath, looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay not seeing
1|the wolf or understanding the situation. Old Karay had turned his head
1|and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and
1|snapping at his hind legs.
1|
1|"Ulyulyulyu!" whispered Rostov, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped
1|up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Karay
1|finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up
1|with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.
1|
1|"Shall I loose them or not?" Nicholas asked himself as the wolf
1|approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf's whole
1|physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never
1|seen before--human eyes fixed upon her--and turning her head a
1|little toward Rostov, she paused.
1|
1|"Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward..." the wolf seemed to
1|say to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round
1|and with a quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.
1|
1|"Ulyulyu!" cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own
1|accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies
1|to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.
1|Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping,
1|nor see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only
1|the wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same
1|direction along the hollow. The first to come into view was Milka,
1|with her black markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the
1|wolf. Nearer and nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf
1|turned its head to face her, and instead of putting on speed as she
1|usually did Milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.
1|
1|"Ulyulyulyulyu!" shouted Nicholas.
1|
1|The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka, sprang
1|impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but
1|immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her
1|teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of
1|a couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to
1|her.
1|
1|"She'll get away! No, it's impossible!" thought Nicholas, still
1|shouting with a hoarse voice.
1|
1|"Karay, ulyulyu!..." he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi
1|who was now his only hope. Karay, with all the strength age had left
1|him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf,
1|galloped heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the
1|wolf's lope and the borzoi's slower pace made it plain that Karay
1|had miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of
1|him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach
1|it. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping
1|almost straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish
1|young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed
1|impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But
1|the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,
1|gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a
1|piercing yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a
1|gash in its side.
1|
1|"Karay? Old fellow!..." wailed Nicholas.
1|
1|Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf's path,
1|the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within
1|five paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her
1|eyes on Karay, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and
1|increased her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something
1|happened to Karay--the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they
1|rolled together down into a gully just in front of them.
1|
1|That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully
1|with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
1|outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears
1|laid back (Karay was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest
1|moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to
1|dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up
1|from among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge
1|of the gully. She clicked her teeth (Karay no longer had her by the
1|throat), leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and
1|having disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again,
1|went forward. Karay, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or
1|wounded, climbed with difficulty out of the gully.
1|
1|"Oh my God! Why?" Nicholas cried in despair.
1|
1|"Uncle's" huntsman was galloping from the other side across the
1|wolf's path and his borzois once more stopped the animal's advance.
1|She was again hemmed in.
1|
1|Nicholas and his attendant, with "Uncle" and his huntsman, were
1|all riding round the wolf, crying "ulyulyu!" shouting and preparing to
1|dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward
1|again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
1|would be safe.
1|
1|Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the
1|ulyulyuing, had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karay seize the wolf,
1|and checked his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he
1|saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself
1|and ran for safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf
1|but straight toward the wood, just as Karay had run to cut the
1|animal off. As a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just
1|when she had been stopped a second time by "Uncle's" borzois.
1|
1|Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand
1|and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip
1|as if it were a flail.
1|
1|Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut,
1|breathing heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body
1|and saw Daniel lying on the wolf's back among the dogs, trying to
1|seize her by the ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to
1|the wolf herself that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed
1|back her ears and tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her.
1|Daniel rose a little, took a step, and with his whole weight, as if
1|lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by the ears.
1|Nicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, "Don't! We'll
1|gag her!" and, changing his position, set his foot on the wolf's neck.
1|A stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash,
1|as if bridled, her legs were bound together, and Daniel rolled her
1|over once or twice from side to side.
1|
1|With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a
1|shying and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her,
1|took her to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had
1|killed two of the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled
1|with their booty and their stories, and all came to look at the
1|wolf, which, with her broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten
1|stick between her jaws, gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd
1|of dogs and men surrounding her. When she was touched, she jerked
1|her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody. Old Count
1|Rostov also rode up and touched the wolf.
1|
1|"Oh, what a formidable one!" said he. "A formidable one, eh?" he
1|asked Daniel, who was standing near.
1|
1|"Yes, your excellency," answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.
1|
1|The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
1|Daniel.
1|
1|"Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!" said the count.
1|
1|For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable
1|smile.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|The old count went home, and Natasha and Petya promised to return
1|very soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At
1|midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with
1|young trees. Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his
1|whips.
1|
1|Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood
1|alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been
1|loosed before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltorn, giving tongue at
1|intervals; other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving
1|tongue. A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a
1|fox had been found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along
1|the ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.
1|
1|He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
1|ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself
1|at any moment on the ryefield opposite.
1|
1|The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois,
1|and Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going
1|hard across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew
1|close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and
1|sharper curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white
1|borzoi dashed in followed by a black one, and everything was in
1|confusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying
1|their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the
1|group. Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in a red cap, the
1|other, a stranger, in a green coat.
1|
1|"What's this?" thought Nicholas. "Where's that huntsman from? He
1|is not 'Uncle's' man."
1|
1|The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without
1|strapping it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high
1|saddles, stood near them and there too the dogs were lying. The
1|huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox. Then from that
1|spot came the sound of a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of
1|a fight.
1|
1|"That's Ilagin's huntsman having a row with our Ivan," said
1|Nicholas' groom.
1|
1|Nicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to him, and rode
1|at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds
1|together. Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight
1|was going on.
1|
1|Nicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and Petya, who had ridden
1|up, stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would
1|end. Out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and
1|rode toward his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper.
1|While still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak
1|respectfully, but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry.
1|One of his eyes was black, but he probably was not even aware of it.
1|
1|"What has happened?" asked Nicholas.
1|
1|"A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my
1|gray bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the
1|fox! I gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want
1|a taste of this?..." said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and
1|probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe.
1|
1|Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and
1|Petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy's,
1|Ilagin's, hunting party was.
1|
1|The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,
1|surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.
1|
1|The facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel
1|and were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the
1|Rostovs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very
1|woods the Rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs
1|had chased.
1|
1|Nicholas, though he had never seen Ilagin, with his usual absence of
1|moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his
1|arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe.
1|He rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and
1|fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish
1|his enemy.
1|
1|Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman
1|in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black
1|horse, accompanied by two hunt servants.
1|
1|Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and
1|courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young
1|count's acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilagin raised
1|his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and
1|would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox
1|hunted by someone else's borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted
1|with the count and invited him to draw his covert.
1|
1|Natasha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had
1|followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging
1|friendly greetings, she rode up to them. Ilagin lifted his beaver
1|cap still higher to Natasha and said, with a pleasant smile, that
1|the young countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as
1|well as in her beauty, of which he had heard much.
1|
1|To expiate his huntsman's offense, Ilagin pressed the Rostovs to
1|come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for
1|himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and
1|the hunt, now doubled, moved on.
1|
1|The way to Iligin's upland was across the fields. The hunt
1|servants fell into line. The masters rode together. "Uncle," Rostov,
1|and Ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one another's dogs, trying
1|not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for
1|rivals to their own borzois.
1|
1|Rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small,
1|pure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Ilagin's leash, slender but with
1|muscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He
1|had heard of the swiftness of Ilagin's borzois, and in that
1|beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own Milka.
1|
1|In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilagin about the
1|year's harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.
1|
1|"A fine little bitch, that!" said he in a careless tone. "Is she
1|swift?"
1|
1|"That one? Yes, she's a good dog, gets what she's after," answered
1|Ilagin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erza, for which, a year
1|before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. "So
1|in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?" he
1|went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And considering
1|it polite to return the young count's compliment, Ilagin looked at his
1|borzois and picked out Milka who attracted his attention by her
1|breadth. "That black-spotted one of yours is fine--well shaped!"
1|said he.
1|
1|"Yes, she's fast enough," replied Nicholas, and thought: "If only
1|a full-grown hare would cross the field now I'd show you what sort
1|of borzoi she is," and turning to his groom, he said he would give a
1|ruble to anyone who found a hare.
1|
1|"I don't understand," continued Ilagin, "how some sportsmen can be
1|so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count, I
1|enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?" (he
1|again raised his cap to Natasha) "but as for counting skins and what
1|one takes, I don't care about that."
1|
1|"Of course not!"
1|
1|"Or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not mine catches
1|something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not
1|so, Count? For I consider that..."
1|
1|"A-tu!" came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,
1|who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip
1|aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, "A-tu!" (This call and
1|the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)
1|
1|"Ah, he has found one, I think," said Ilagin carelessly. "Yes, we
1|must ride up.... Shall we both course it?" answered Nicholas, seeing
1|in Erza and "Uncle's" red Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a
1|chance of pitting against his own borzois. "And suppose they outdo
1|my Milka at once!" he thought as he rode with "Uncle" and Ilagin
1|toward the hare.
1|
1|"A full-grown one?" asked Ilagin as he approached the whip who had
1|sighted the hare--and not without agitation he looked round and
1|whistled to Erza.
1|
1|"And you, Michael Nikanorovich?" he said, addressing "Uncle."
1|
1|The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.
1|
1|"How can I join in? Why, you've given a village for each of your
1|borzois! That's it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours
1|against one another, you two, and I'll look on!"
1|
1|"Rugay, hey, hey!" he shouted. "Rugayushka!" he added, involuntarily
1|by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on
1|this red borzoi. Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly
1|men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by
1|it.
1|
1|The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and
1|the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were
1|far off on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but
1|not the gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and
1|sedately.
1|
1|"How is it pointing?" asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces
1|toward the whip who had sighted the hare.
1|
1|But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming
1|next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash
1|rushed downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the
1|borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare.
1|All the hunt, who had been moving slowly, shouted, "Stop!" calling
1|in the hounds, while the borzoi whips, with a cry of "A-tu!" galloped
1|across the field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilagin,
1|Nicholas, Natasha, and "Uncle" flew, reckless of where and how they
1|went, seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose
1|sight even for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started
1|was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at
1|once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling
1|that resounded from all sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not
1|very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him, and, finally having
1|chosen his direction and realized his danger, laid back his ears and
1|rushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble, but in front of
1|him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft. The two borzois
1|of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the nearest, were the
1|first to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far before Ilagin's
1|red-spotted Erza passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare
1|with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had
1|seized him, rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his back and
1|bounded off yet more swiftly. From behind Erza rushed the
1|broad-haunched, black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the
1|hare.
1|
1|"Milashka, dear!" rose Nicholas' triumphant cry. It looked as if
1|Milka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and
1|flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erza reached
1|him, but when close to the hare's scut paused as if measuring the
1|distance, so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind
1|leg.
1|
1|"Erza, darling!" Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erza did
1|not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have
1|seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between
1|the winter rye and the stubble. Again Erza and Milka were abreast,
1|running like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the
1|hare, but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the
1|borzois did not overtake him so quickly.
1|
1|"Rugay, Rugayushka! That's it, come on!" came a third voice just
1|then, and "Uncle's" red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught
1|up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of
1|the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off
1|the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,
1|sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was
1|how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of
1|borzois surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the
1|crowd of dogs. Only the delighted "Uncle" dismounted, and cut off a
1|pad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously
1|glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He
1|spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about. "That's it,
1|come on! That's a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the
1|thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That's it, come
1|on!" said he, panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were
1|abusing someone, as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him,
1|and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself. "There
1|are your thousand-ruble ones.... That's it, come on!..."
1|
1|"Rugay, here's a pad for you!" he said, throwing down the hare's
1|muddy pad. "You've deserved it, that's it, come on!"
1|
1|"She'd tired herself out, she'd run it down three times by herself,"
1|said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of
1|whether he were heard or not.
1|
1|"But what is there in running across it like that?" said Ilagin's
1|groom.
1|
1|"Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take
1|it," Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop
1|and his excitement. At the same moment Natasha, without drawing
1|breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set
1|everyone's ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the
1|others expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that
1|she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone
1|else would have been amazed at it at any other time. "Uncle" himself
1|twisted up the hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horse's
1|back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with
1|an air of not wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode
1|off. The others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much
1|later were they able to regain their former affectation of
1|indifference. For a long time they continued to look at red Rugay who,
1|his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash,
1|walked along just behind "Uncle's" horse with the serene air of a
1|conqueror.
1|
1|"Well, I am like any other dog as long as it's not a question of
1|coursing. But when it is, then look out!" his appearance seemed to
1|Nicholas to be saying.
1|
1|When, much later, "Uncle" rode up to Nicholas and began talking to
1|him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, "Uncle"
1|deigned to speak to him.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Toward evening Ilagin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they
1|were so far from home that he accepted "Uncle's" offer that the
1|hunting party should spend the night in his little village of
1|Mikhaylovna.
1|
1|"And if you put up at my house that will be better still. That's it,
1|come on!" said "Uncle." "You see it's damp weather, and you could
1|rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap."
1|
1|"Uncle's" offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for
1|a trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to "Uncle's" house.
1|
1|Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front
1|porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as
1|well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
1|the hunters who were arriving. The presence of Natasha--a woman, a
1|lady, and on horseback--raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a
1|degree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and
1|unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were
1|some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand
1|what was said about her.
1|
1|"Arinka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt
1|dangles.... See, she's got a little hunting horn!"
1|
1|"Goodness gracious! See her knife?..."
1|
1|"Isn't she a Tartar!"
1|
1|"How is it you didn't go head over heels?" asked the boldest of all,
1|addressing Natasha directly.
1|
1|"Uncle" dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which
1|stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his
1|retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should
1|take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made
1|to receive the guests and the visitors.
1|
1|The serfs all dispersed. "Uncle" lifted Natasha off her horse and
1|taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch.
1|The house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean--it
1|did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless--but
1|neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of
1|fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.
1|
1|"Uncle" led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with
1|a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a
1|round birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room
1|where there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of
1|Suvorov, of the host's father and mother, and of himself in military
1|uniform. The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. "Uncle" asked
1|his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went
1|out of the room. Rugay, his back still muddy, came into the room and
1|lay down on the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth.
1|Leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with
1|ragged curtains could be seen. From behind this came women's
1|laughter and whispers. Natasha, Nicholas, and Petya took off their
1|wraps and sat down on the sofa. Petya, leaning on his elbow, fell
1|asleep at once. Natasha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces
1|glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another
1|(now that the hunt was over and they were in the house, Nicholas no
1|longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over
1|his sister), Natasha gave him a wink, and neither refrained long
1|from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a
1|pretext ready to account for it.
1|
1|After a while "Uncle" came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and
1|small top boots. And Natasha felt that this costume, the very one
1|she had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe, was just the
1|right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.
1|"Uncle" too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the
1|brother's and sister's laughter (it could never enter his head that
1|they might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the
1|merriment.
1|
1|"That's right, young countess, that's it, come on! I never saw
1|anyone like her!" said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem
1|and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another
1|that had been cut short. "She's ridden all day like a man, and is as
1|fresh as ever!"
1|
1|Soon after "Uncle's" reappearance the door was opened, evidently
1|from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking
1|woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered
1|carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality
1|in her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and,
1|with a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional
1|stoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and
1|throw back her head, this woman (who was "Uncle's" housekeeper) trod
1|very lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her
1|plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors
1|d'oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had
1|finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on
1|her face. "Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand 'Uncle'?" her
1|expression said to Rostov. How could one help understanding? Not
1|only Nicholas, but even Natasha understood the meaning of his puckered
1|brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips
1|when Anisya Fedorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb
1|wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with
1|buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead,
1|apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards
1|she brought a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey,
1|and preserves made with sugar.
1|
1|All this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna's housekeeping,
1|gathered and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a
1|smack of Anisya Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness,
1|cleanliness, whiteness, and pleasant smiles.
1|
1|"Take this, little Lady-Countess!" she kept saying, as she offered
1|Natasha first one thing and then another.
1|
1|Natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten
1|such buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets,
1|or such a chicken anywhere. Anisya Fedorovna left the room.
1|
1|After supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostov and "Uncle" talked of
1|past and future hunts, of Rugay and Ilagin's dogs, while Natasha sat
1|upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried
1|several times to wake Petya that he might eat something, but he only
1|muttered incoherent words without waking up. Natasha felt so
1|lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only
1|feared the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause,
1|such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in
1|one's own house, "Uncle," answering a thought that was in his
1|visitors' mind, said:
1|
1|"This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.
1|That's it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?"
1|
1|"Uncle's" face was very significant and even handsome as he said
1|this. Involuntarily Rostov recalled all the good he had heard about
1|him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province
1|"Uncle" had the reputation of being the most honorable and
1|disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,
1|chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a
1|justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused
1|public appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on
1|his bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown
1|garden in summer.
1|
1|"Why don't you enter the service, Uncle?"
1|
1|"I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That's it, come
1|on! I can't make head or tail of it. That's for you--I haven't
1|brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter--that's it, come on!
1|Open the door, there!" he shouted. "Why have you shut it?"
1|
1|The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen's room, as
1|they called the room for the hunt servants.
1|
1|There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the
1|door into the huntsmen's room, from which came the clear sounds of a
1|balalayka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was
1|playing. Natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and
1|now went out into the passage to hear better.
1|
1|"That's Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balalayka.
1|I'm fond of it," said "Uncle."
1|
1|It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the
1|huntsmen's room when "Uncle" returned from the chase. "Uncle" was fond
1|of such music.
1|
1|"How good! Really very good!" said Nicholas with some
1|unintentional superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the
1|sounds pleased him very much.
1|
1|"Very good?" said Natasha reproachfully, noticing her brother's
1|tone. "Not 'very good' it's simply delicious!"
1|
1|Just as "Uncle's" pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had
1|seemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that
1|moment, seemed to her the acme of musical delight.
1|
1|"More, please, more!" cried Natasha at the door as soon as the
1|balalayka ceased. Mitka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the
1|balalayka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. "Uncle"
1|sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air
1|was repeated a hundred times. The balalayka was retuned several
1|times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did
1|not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. Anisya
1|Fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.
1|
1|"You like listening?" she said to Natasha, with a smile extremely
1|like "Uncle's." "That's a good player of ours," she added.
1|
1|"He doesn't play that part right!" said "Uncle" suddenly, with an
1|energetic gesture. "Here he ought to burst out--that's it, come
1|on!--ought to burst out."
1|
1|"Do you play then?" asked Natasha.
1|
1|"Uncle" did not answer, but smiled.
1|
1|"Anisya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I
1|haven't touched it for a long time. That's it--come on! I've given
1|it up."
1|
1|Anisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her
1|errand and brought back the guitar.
1|
1|Without looking at anyone, "Uncle" blew the dust off it and, tapping
1|the case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself
1|in his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard,
1|arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a
1|wink at Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous,
1|and then quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow
1|time, not My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the
1|street. The tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to
1|thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natasha, arousing in them the
1|same kind of sober mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna's whole
1|being. Anisya Fedorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her
1|face went laughing out of the room. "Uncle" continued to play
1|correctly, carefully, with energetic firmness, looking with a
1|changed and inspired expression at the spot where Anisya Fedorovna had
1|just stood. Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of
1|his face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song grew brisker
1|and the time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his fingers
1|over the strings, something seemed to snap.
1|
1|"Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!" shouted Natasha as soon as he
1|had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. "Nicholas,
1|Nicholas!" she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: "What
1|is it moves me so?"
1|
1|Nicholas too was greatly pleased by "Uncle's" playing, and "Uncle"
1|played the piece over again. Anisya Fedorovna's smiling face
1|reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...
1|
1|    Fetching water clear and sweet,
1|    Stop, dear maiden, I entreat--
1|
1|played "Uncle" once more, running his fingers skillfully over the
1|strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.
1|
1|"Go on, Uncle dear," Natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her
1|life depended on it.
1|
1|"Uncle" rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of
1|them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow
1|struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.
1|
1|"Now then, niece!" he exclaimed, waving to Natasha the hand that had
1|just struck a chord.
1|
1|Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to
1|face "Uncle," and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with
1|her shoulders and struck an attitude.
1|
1|Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an emigree
1|French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that
1|spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale* would, one
1|would have supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the
1|movements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that
1|"Uncle" had expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and
1|smiled triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that
1|had at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do
1|the right thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.
1|
1|
1|*The French shawl dance.
1|
1|
1|She did the right thing with such precision, such complete
1|precision, that Anisya Fedorovna, who had at once handed her the
1|handkerchief she needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though
1|she laughed as she watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in
1|silks and velvets and so different from herself, who yet was able to
1|understand all that was in Anisya and in Anisya's father and mother
1|and aunt, and in every Russian man and woman.
1|
1|"Well, little countess; that's it--come on!" cried "Uncle," with a
1|joyous laugh, having finished the dance. "Well done, niece! Now a fine
1|young fellow must be found as husband for you. That's it--come on!"
1|
1|"He's chosen already," said Nicholas smiling.
1|
1|"Oh?" said "Uncle" in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natasha,
1|who nodded her head with a happy smile.
1|
1|"And such a one!" she said. But as soon as she had said it a new
1|train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. "What did Nicholas' smile
1|mean when he said 'chosen already'? Is he glad of it or not? It is
1|as if he thought my Bolkonski would not approve of or understand our
1|gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?" she thought,
1|and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a second.
1|"Don't dare to think about it," she said to herself, and sat down
1|again smilingly beside "Uncle," begging him to play something more.
1|
1|"Uncle" played another song and a valse; then after a pause he
1|cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:
1|
1|    As 'twas growing dark last night
1|    Fell the snow so soft and light...
1|
1|
1|"Uncle" sang as peasants sing, with full and naive conviction that
1|the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune
1|comes of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which
1|exists only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the
1|unconsidered tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily
1|good. Natasha was in ecstasies over "Uncle's" singing. She resolved to
1|give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked
1|"Uncle" for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song.
1|
1|After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been
1|sent to look for them, arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya. The count
1|and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious,
1|said one of the men.
1|
1|Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
1|traps. Natasha and Nicholas got into the other. "Uncle" wrapped
1|Natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness.
1|He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be
1|crossed, so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent
1|huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.
1|
1|"Good-by, dear niece," his voice called out of the darkness--not the
1|voice Natasha had known previously, but the one that had sung As 'twas
1|growing dark last night.
1|
1|In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
1|cheerful smell of smoke.
1|
1|"What a darling Uncle is!" said Natasha, when they had come out onto
1|the highroad.
1|
1|"Yes," returned Nicholas. "You're not cold?"
1|
1|"No. I'm quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!" answered
1|Natasha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long
1|while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but
1|only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.
1|
1|What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly
1|caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did
1|they all find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were
1|nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As 'twas growing dark
1|last night--the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get
1|and had at last caught.
1|
1|"Got it?" said Nicholas.
1|
1|"What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?" inquired Natasha.
1|
1|They were fond of asking one another that question.
1|
1|"I?" said Nicholas, trying to remember. "Well, you see, first I
1|thought that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were
1|a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then
1|for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don't you think so?...
1|Well, and you?"
1|
1|"I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving
1|along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows
1|where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive
1|and suddenly find that we are not in Otradnoe, but in Fairyland. And
1|then I thought... No, nothing else."
1|
1|"I know, I expect you thought of him," said Nicholas, smiling as
1|Natasha knew by the sound of his voice.
1|
1|"No," said Natasha, though she had in reality been thinking about
1|Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would
1|have liked "Uncle." "And then I was saying to myself all the way, 'How
1|well Anisya carried herself, how well!'" And Nicholas heard her
1|spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. "And do you know," she
1|suddenly said, "I know that I shall never again be as happy and
1|tranquil as I am now."
1|
1|"Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!" exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:
1|"How charming this Natasha of mine is! I have no other friend like her
1|and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive
1|about together!"
1|
1|"What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!" thought Natasha.
1|
1|"Ah, there are still lights in the drawingroom!" she said,
1|pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the
1|moist velvety darkness of the night.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|Count Ilya Rostov had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility
1|because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs did
1|not improve. Natasha and Nicholas often noticed their parents
1|conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of
1|selling the fine ancestral Rostov house and estate near Moscow. It was
1|not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been
1|Marshal, and life at Otradnoe was quieter than in former years, but
1|still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more
1|than twenty sat down to table every day. These were all their own
1|people who had settled down in the house almost as members of the
1|family, or persons who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the count's
1|house. Such were Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing
1|master and his family, Belova, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the
1|house, and many others such as Petya's tutors, the girls' former
1|governess, and other people who simply found it preferable and more
1|advantageous to live in the count's house than at home. They had not
1|as many visitors as before, but the old habits of life without which
1|the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained
1|unchanged. There was still the hunting establishment which Nicholas
1|had even enlarged, the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the
1|stables, the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole
1|district on name days; there were still the count's games of whist and
1|boston, at which--spreading out his cards so that everybody could see
1|them--he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by
1|his neighbors, who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with
1|Count Rostov as a most profitable source of income.
1|
1|The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to
1|believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every
1|step, and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work
1|carefully and patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her
1|loving heart, felt that her children were being ruined, that it was
1|not the count's fault for he could not help being what he was--that
1|(though he tried to hide it) he himself suffered from the
1|consciousness of his own and his children's ruin, and she tried to
1|find means of remedying the position. From her feminine point of
1|view she could see only one solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry
1|a rich heiress. She felt this to be their last hope and that if
1|Nicholas refused the match she had found for him, she would have to
1|abandon the hope of ever getting matters right. This match was with
1|Julie Karagina, the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents, a girl
1|the Rostovs had known from childhood, and who had now become a wealthy
1|heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.
1|
1|The countess had written direct to Julie's mother in Moscow
1|suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a
1|favorable answer from her. Karagina had replied that for her part
1|she was agreeable, and everything depend on her daughter's
1|inclination. She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow.
1|
1|Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son
1|that now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him
1|married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
1|were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid
1|girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.
1|
1|At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to
1|Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his
1|mother's remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations
1|induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope of
1|getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie
1|Karagina.
1|
1|"But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would you
1|expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of
1|money?" he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question
1|and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.
1|
1|"No, you have not understood me," said his mother, not knowing how
1|to justify herself. "You have not understood me, Nikolenka. It is your
1|happiness I wish for," she added, feeling that she was telling an
1|untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.
1|
1|"Mamma, don't cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I
1|will give my life, anything, to put you at ease," said Nicholas. "I
1|would sacrifice anything for you--even my feelings."
1|
1|But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did
1|not want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a
1|sacrifice for him.
1|
1|"No, you have not understood me, don't let us talk about it," she
1|replied, wiping away her tears.
1|
1|"Maybe I do love a poor girl," said Nicholas to himself. "Am I to
1|sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could
1|speak so to me. Because Sonya is poor I must not love her," he
1|thought, "must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should
1|certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can
1|always sacrifice my feelings for my family's welfare," he said to
1|himself, "but I can't coerce my feelings. If I love Sonya, that
1|feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else."
1|
1|Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the
1|conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and
1|sometimes with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment
1|between her son and the portionless Sonya. Though she blamed herself
1|for it, she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sonya,
1|often pulling her up without reason, addressing her stiffly as "my
1|dear," and using the formal "you" instead of the intimate "thou" in
1|speaking to her. The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with
1|Sonya because that poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind,
1|so devotedly grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully,
1|unchangingly, and unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were
1|no grounds for finding fault with her.
1|
1|Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter
1|had come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he
1|would have been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound
1|unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to
1|defer his return till the beginning of the new year. Natasha was still
1|as much in love with her betrothed, found the same comfort in that
1|love, and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures
1|of life as before; but at the end of the fourth month of their
1|separation she began to have fits of depression which she could not
1|master. She felt sorry for herself: sorry that she was being wasted
1|all this time and of no use to anyone--while she felt herself so
1|capable of loving and being loved.
1|
1|Things were not cheerful in the Rostovs' home.
1|

1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and
1|wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and
1|the new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities,
1|though the calm frost of twenty degrees Reaumur, the dazzling sunshine
1|by day, and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some
1|special celebration of the season.
1|
1|On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the
1|inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest
1|time of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that
1|morning, was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was
1|resting in his study. Sonya sat in the drawing room at the round
1|table, copying a design for embroidery. The countess was playing
1|patience. Nastasya Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the
1|window with two old ladies. Natasha came into the room, went up to
1|Sonya, glanced at what she was doing, and then went up to her mother
1|and stood without speaking.
1|
1|"Why are you wandering about like an outcast?" asked her mother.
1|"What do you want?"
1|
1|"Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!" said Natasha,
1|with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.
1|
1|The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.
1|
1|"Don't look at me, Mamma! Don't look; I shall cry directly."
1|
1|"Sit down with me a little," said the countess.
1|
1|"Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?"
1|
1|Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned
1|quickly to hide them and left the room.
1|
1|She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and
1|then went into the maids' room. There an old maidservant was grumbling
1|at a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold
1|from the serfs' quarters.
1|
1|"Stop playing--there's a time for everything," said the old woman.
1|
1|"Let her alone, Kondratevna," said Natasha. "Go, Mavrushka, go."
1|
1|Having released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went
1|to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing
1|cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.
1|
1|"What can I do with them?" thought Natasha.
1|
1|"Oh, Nikita, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the
1|yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some
1|oats."
1|
1|"Just a few oats?" said Misha, cheerfully and readily.
1|
1|"Go, go quickly," the old man urged him.
1|
1|"And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk."
1|
1|On her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a
1|samovar, though it was not at all the time for tea.
1|
1|Foka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.
1|Natasha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order
1|and asked whether the samovar was really wanted.
1|
1|"Oh dear, what a young lady!" said Foka, pretending to frown at
1|Natasha.
1|
1|No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble
1|as Natasha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to
1|send them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of
1|them would get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no
1|one's orders so readily as they did hers. "What can I do, where can
1|I go?" thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.
1|
1|"Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?" she asked
1|the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman's jacket.
1|
1|"Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers," answered the buffoon.
1|
1|"O Lord, O Lord, it's always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am
1|I to do with myself?" And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly
1|upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.
1|
1|Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which
1|were plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were
1|discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natasha
1|sat down, listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air,
1|and then got up again.
1|
1|"The island of Madagascar," she said, "Ma-da-gas-car," she repeated,
1|articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame
1|Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.
1|
1|Her brother Petya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on
1|him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.
1|
1|"Petya! Petya!" she called to him. "Carry me downstairs."
1|
1|Petya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her
1|arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.
1|
1|"No, don't... the island of Madagascar!" she said, and jumping off
1|his back she went downstairs.
1|
1|Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made
1|sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was
1|dull, Natasha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar,
1|sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her
1|fingers over the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she
1|recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew.
1|What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other
1|listeners, but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences
1|arose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes
1|fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and
1|listened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on
1|the past.
1|
1|Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha glanced
1|at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her
1|that she remembered the light falling through that crack once before
1|and Sonya passing with a glass in her hand. "Yes it was exactly the
1|same," thought Natasha.
1|
1|"Sonya, what is this?" she cried, twanging a thick string.
1|
1|"Oh, you are there!" said Sonya with a start, and came near and
1|listened. "I don't know. A storm?" she ventured timidly, afraid of
1|being wrong.
1|
1|"There! That's just how she started and just how she came up smiling
1|timidly when all this happened before," thought Natasha, "and in
1|just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her."
1|
1|"No, it's the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!" and Natasha
1|sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it. "Where
1|were you going?" she asked.
1|
1|"To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design."
1|
1|"You always find something to do, but I can't," said Natasha. "And
1|where's Nicholas?"
1|
1|"Asleep, I think."
1|
1|"Sonya, go and wake him," said Natasha. "Tell him I want him to come
1|and sing."
1|
1|She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
1|before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all
1|regretting not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time
1|when she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover's eyes.
1|
1|"Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!
1|And, worst of all, I am growing old--that's the thing! There won't
1|then be in me what there is now. But perhaps he'll come today, will
1|come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing
1|room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it." She rose,
1|put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.
1|
1|All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were
1|already at the tea table. The servants stood round the table--but
1|Prince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before.
1|
1|"Ah, here she is!" said the old count, when he saw Natasha enter.
1|"Well, sit down by me." But Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced
1|round as if looking for something.
1|
1|"Mamma!" she muttered, "give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,
1|quickly!" and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.
1|
1|She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between
1|the elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. "My God, my
1|God! The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing
1|in the same way!" thought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense of
1|repulsion rising up in her for the whole household, because they
1|were always the same.
1|
1|After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting room, to
1|their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|"Does it ever happen to you," said Natasha to her brother, when
1|they settled down in the sitting room, "does it ever happen to you
1|to feel as if there were nothing more to come--nothing; that
1|everything good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?"
1|
1|"I should think so!" he replied. "I have felt like that when
1|everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has
1|come into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must
1|all die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where
1|there was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed..."
1|
1|"Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!" Natasha interrupted him. "When I
1|was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I
1|was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat
1|sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and
1|sorry for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was
1|innocent--that was the chief thing," said Natasha. "Do you remember?"
1|
1|"I remember," answered Nicholas. "I remember that I came to you
1|afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt
1|ashamed to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and
1|wanted to give it to you. Do you remember?"
1|
1|"And do you remember," Natasha asked with a pensive smile, "how
1|once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us
1|into the study--that was in the old house--and it was dark--we went in
1|and suddenly there stood..."
1|
1|"A Negro," chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. "Of course
1|I remember. Even now I don't know whether there really was a Negro, or
1|if we only dreamed it or were told about him."
1|
1|"He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and
1|looked at us..."
1|
1|"Sonya, do you remember?" asked Nicholas.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, I do remember something too," Sonya answered timidly.
1|
1|"You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro," said
1|Natasha, "and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you
1|remember!"
1|
1|"Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them."
1|
1|"How strange it is! It's as if it were a dream! I like that."
1|
1|"And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,
1|and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was
1|that real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?"
1|
1|"Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun
1|in the porch?"
1|
1|So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not
1|the sad memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones--those
1|impressions of one's most distant past in which dreams and realities
1|blend--and they laughed with quiet enjoyment.
1|
1|Sonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they
1|shared the same reminiscences.
1|
1|Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she
1|recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced.
1|She simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.
1|
1|She only really took part when they recalled Sonya's first
1|arrival. She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because
1|he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too,
1|would be sewn up with cords.
1|
1|"And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a
1|cabbage," said Natasha, "and I remember that I dared not disbelieve
1|it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable."
1|
1|While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other
1|door of the sitting room.
1|
1|"They have brought the cock, Miss," she said in a whisper.
1|
1|"It isn't wanted, Petya. Tell them to take it away," replied
1|Natasha.
1|
1|In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and
1|went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its
1|cloth covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.
1|
1|"Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field," came the
1|old countess' voice from the drawing room.
1|
1|Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natasha, Nicholas, and Sonya,
1|remarked: "How quiet you young people are!"
1|
1|"Yes, we're philosophizing," said Natasha, glancing round for a
1|moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now
1|discussing dreams.
1|
1|Dimmler began to play; Natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the
1|table, took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself
1|quietly in her former place. It was dark in the room especially
1|where they were sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the
1|silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished
1|the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings,
1|evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.
1|
1|"Do you know," said Natasha in a whisper, moving closer to
1|Nicholas and Sonya, "that when one goes on and on recalling
1|memories, one at last begins to remember what happened before one
1|was in the world..."
1|
1|"That is metempsychosis," said Sonya, who had always learned well,
1|and remembered everything. "The Egyptians believed that our souls have
1|lived in animals, and will go back into animals again."
1|
1|"No, I don't believe we ever were in animals," said Natasha, still
1|in a whisper though the music had ceased. "But I am certain that we
1|were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we
1|remember...."
1|
1|"May I join you?" said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat
1|down by them.
1|
1|"If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?" said Nicholas.
1|"No, that can't be!"
1|
1|"Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was
1|before?" Natasha rejoined with conviction. "The soul is immortal--well
1|then, if I shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a
1|whole eternity."
1|
1|"Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity," remarked
1|Dimmler, who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending
1|smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they.
1|
1|"Why is it hard to imagine eternity?" said Natasha. "It is now
1|today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday,
1|and the day before..."
1|
1|"Natasha! Now it's your turn. Sing me something," they heard the
1|countess say. "Why are you sitting there like conspirators?"
1|
1|"Mamma, I don't at all want to," replied Natasha, but all the same
1|she rose.
1|
1|None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break
1|off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but
1|Natasha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as
1|usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the
1|resonance was best, Natasha began to sing her mother's favorite song.
1|
1|She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had
1|sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The
1|count, from his study where he was talking to Mitenka, heard her
1|and, like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in
1|his talk while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped,
1|while Mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling.
1|Nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in
1|time with her. Sonya, as she listened, thought of the immense
1|difference there was between herself and her friend, and how
1|impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her
1|cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with
1|tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She thought of
1|Natasha and of her own youth, and of how there was something unnatural
1|and dreadful in this impending marriage of Natasha and Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with
1|closed eyes.
1|
1|"Ah, Countess," he said at last, "that's a European talent, she
1|has nothing to learn--what softness, tenderness, and strength...."
1|
1|"Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!" said the countess,
1|not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her
1|that Natasha had too much of something, and that because of this she
1|would not be happy. Before Natasha had finished singing,
1|fourteen-year-old Petya rushed in delightedly, to say that some
1|mummers had arrived.
1|
1|Natasha stopped abruptly.
1|
1|"Idiot!" she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair,
1|threw herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop
1|for a long time.
1|
1|"It's nothing, Mamma, really it's nothing; only Petya startled
1|me," she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs
1|still choked her.
1|
1|The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,
1|innkeepers, and ladies--frightening and funny--bringing in with them
1|the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first
1|timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed
1|into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily
1|and heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas
1|games. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their
1|costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,
1|smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had
1|disappeared.
1|
1|Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
1|ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt--this was Nicholas. A Turkish
1|girl was Petya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natasha, and a
1|Circassian was Sonya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.
1|
1|After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from
1|those who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided
1|that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown
1|elsewhere.
1|
1|Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to
1|take them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them
1|about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to "Uncle's."
1|
1|"No, why disturb the old fellow?" said the countess. "Besides, you
1|wouldn't have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the
1|Melyukovs'."
1|
1|Melyukova was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and
1|governesses, lived three miles from the Rostovs.
1|
1|"That's right, my dear," chimed in the old count, thoroughly
1|aroused. "I'll dress up at once and go with them. I'll make Pashette
1|open her eyes."
1|
1|But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad
1|leg all these last days. It was decided that the count must not go,
1|but that if Louisa Ivanovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the
1|young ladies might go to the Melyukovs', Sonya, generally so timid and
1|shy, more urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivanovna not to refuse.
1|
1|Sonya's costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows
1|were extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very
1|handsome, and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with
1|her. Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be
1|decided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person.
1|Louisa Ivanovna consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka
1|sleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking and
1|whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch.
1|
1|Natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing
1|from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax
1|when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs,
1|talking, calling to one another, laughing, and shouting.
1|
1|Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was
1|the old count's with a trotter from the Orlov stud as shaft horse, the
1|fourth was Nicholas' own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.
1|Nicholas, in his old lady's dress over which he had belted his
1|hussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.
1|
1|It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the
1|metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked
1|round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.
1|
1|Natasha, Sonya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas'
1|sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Petya, into the old count's, and the
1|rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.
1|
1|"You go ahead, Zakhar!" shouted Nicholas to his father's coachman,
1|wishing for a chance to race past him.
1|
1|The old count's troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,
1|squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its
1|deep-toned bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts
1|of the middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered
1|like sugar, and threw it up.
1|
1|Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the
1|others moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove
1|at a steady trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the
1|garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and
1|hid the brilliant moonlight, but as soon as they were past the
1|fence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out
1|before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish
1|shadows. Bang, bang! went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the
1|snow of the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same
1|way, and rudely breaking the frost-bound stillness, the troykas
1|began to speed along the road, one after the other.
1|
1|"A hare's track, a lot of tracks!" rang out Natasha's voice
1|through the frost-bound air.
1|
1|"How light it is, Nicholas!" came Sonya's voice.
1|
1|Nicholas glanced round at Sonya, and bent down to see her face closer.
1|Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at
1|him from her sable furs--so close and yet so distant--in the
1|moonlight.
1|
1|"That used to be Sonya," thought he, and looked at her closer and
1|smiled.
1|
1|"What is it, Nicholas?"
1|
1|"Nothing," said he and turned again to the horses.
1|
1|When they came out onto the beaten highroad--polished by sleigh
1|runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were
1|visible in the moonlight--the horses began to tug at the reins of
1|their own accord and increased their pace. The near side horse,
1|arching his head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his
1|traces. The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears as
1|if asking: "Isn't it time to begin now?" In front, already far ahead
1|the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off, the black
1|horses driven by Zakhar could be clearly seen against the white
1|snow. From that sleigh one could hear the shouts, laughter, and voices
1|of the mummers.
1|
1|"Gee up, my darlings!" shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one
1|side and flourishing the whip.
1|
1|It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by
1|the side horses who pulled harder--ever increasing their gallop--that
1|one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With
1|screams squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
1|to gallop--the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily
1|beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and
1|ready to put on speed when required.
1|
1|Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and
1|coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.
1|
1|"Where are we?" thought he. "It's the Kosoy meadow, I suppose. But
1|no--this is something new I've never seen before. This isn't the Kosoy
1|meadow nor the Demkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is! It is
1|something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be..." And shouting
1|to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.
1|
1|Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face, which was already
1|covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.
1|
1|Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhar, stretching out his
1|arms, clucked his tongue and let his horses go.
1|
1|"Now, look out, master!" he cried.
1|
1|Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved the
1|feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.
1|Zakhar, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with
1|the reins.
1|
1|"No you won't, master!" he shouted.
1|
1|Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar. The horses
1|showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh--beside
1|them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
1|swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.
1|The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
1|shrieking were heard from different sides.
1|
1|Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were
1|still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled
1|with stars.
1|
1|"Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the
1|left?" thought Nicholas. "Are we getting to the Melyukovs'? Is this
1|Melyukovka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows
1|what is happening to us--but it is very strange and pleasant
1|whatever it is." And he looked round in the sleigh.
1|
1|"Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!" said one of the
1|strange, pretty, unfamiliar people--the one with fine eyebrows and
1|mustache.
1|
1|"I think this used to be Natasha," thought Nicholas, "and that was
1|Madame Schoss, but perhaps it's not, and this Circassian with the
1|mustache I don't know, but I love her."
1|
1|"Aren't you cold?" he asked.
1|
1|They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh
1|behind shouted something--probably something funny--but they could not
1|make out what he said.
1|
1|"Yes, yes!" some voices answered, laughing.
1|
1|"But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a
1|glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver
1|roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And
1|if this is really Melyukovka, it is still stranger that we drove
1|heaven knows where and have come to Melyukovka," thought Nicholas.
1|
1|It really was Melyukovka, and maids and footmen with merry faces
1|came running, out to the porch carrying candles.
1|
1|"Who is it?" asked someone in the porch.
1|
1|"The mummers from the count's. I know by the horses," replied some
1|voices.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova, a broadly built, energetic woman
1|wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress,
1|surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling
1|dull. They were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at
1|the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard
1|the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.
1|
1|Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their
1|throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,
1|came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The
1|clown--Dimmler--and the lady--Nicholas--started a dance. Surrounded by
1|the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and
1|disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged
1|themselves about the room.
1|
1|"Dear me! there's no recognizing them! And Natasha! See whom she
1|looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler--isn't
1|he good! I didn't know him! And how he dances. Dear me, there's a
1|Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear Sonya. And who is that?
1|Well, you have cheered us up! Nikita and Vanya--clear away the tables!
1|And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar!
1|Just like a boy! And the legs!... I can't look at him..." different
1|voices were saying.
1|
1|Natasha, the young Melyukovs' favorite, disappeared with them into
1|the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male
1|garments were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish
1|arms from behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young
1|Melyukovs joined the mummers.
1|
1|Pelageya Danilovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the
1|visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,
1|went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles,
1|peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to
1|recognize any of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostovs she
1|failed to recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters,
1|or her late husband's, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put
1|on.
1|
1|"And who is this?" she asked her governess, peering into the face
1|of her own daughter dressed up as a Kazan-Tartar. "I suppose it is one
1|of the Rostovs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve
1|in?" she asked Natasha. "Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!" she
1|ordered the butler who was handing things round. "That's not forbidden
1|by his law."
1|
1|Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by
1|the dancers, who--having decided once for all that being disguised, no
1|one would recognize them--were not at all shy, Pelageya Danilovna
1|hid her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook
1|with irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.
1|
1|"My little Sasha! Look at Sasha!" she said.
1|
1|After Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelageya Danilovna
1|made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a
1|string, and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games
1|together.
1|
1|In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The
1|corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring,
1|flushed, and merry faces. Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the
1|mummers, admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly
1|how they suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for
1|having entertained her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in
1|the drawing room, and the serfs had something served to them in the
1|ballroom.
1|
1|"Now to tell one's fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!"
1|said an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs, during supper.
1|
1|"Why?" said the eldest Melyukov girl.
1|
1|"You wouldn't go, it takes courage..."
1|
1|"I'll go," said Sonya.
1|
1|"Tell what happened to the young lady!" said the second Melyukov
1|girl.
1|
1|"Well," began the old maid, "a young lady once went out, took a
1|cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After
1|sitting a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh
1|drives up with harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in,
1|just in the shape of a man, like an officer--comes in and sits down to
1|table with her."
1|
1|"Ah! ah!" screamed Natasha, rolling her eyes with horror.
1|
1|"Yes? And how... did he speak?"
1|
1|"Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began
1|persuading her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow,
1|but she got frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her
1|hands. Then he caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just
1|then..."
1|
1|"Now, why frighten them?" said Pelageya Danilovna.
1|
1|"Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself..." said her daughter.
1|
1|"And how does one do it in a barn?" inquired Sonya.
1|
1|"Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on
1|what you hear; hammering and knocking--that's bad; but a sound of
1|shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too."
1|
1|"Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn."
1|
1|Pelageya Danilovna smiled.
1|
1|"Oh, I've forgotten..." she replied. "But none of you would go?"
1|
1|"Yes, I will; Pelageya Danilovna, let me! I'll go," said Sonya.
1|
1|"Well, why not, if you're not afraid?"
1|
1|"Louisa Ivanovna, may I?" asked Sonya.
1|
1|Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game
1|or talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sonya's side, and gazed at
1|her with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today,
1|thanks to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to
1|know her. And really, that evening, Sonya was brighter, more animated,
1|and prettier than Nicholas had ever seen her before.
1|
1|"So that's what she is like; what a fool I have been!" he thought
1|gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous
1|smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.
1|
1|"I'm not afraid of anything," said Sonya. "May I go at once?" She
1|got up.
1|
1|They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and
1|listen, and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her
1|head and shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.
1|
1|"What a darling that girl is!" thought he. "And what have I been
1|thinking of till now?"
1|
1|Sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went
1|hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of
1|people really had made the house stuffy.
1|
1|Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but
1|even brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow
1|sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the
1|sky and the real stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary,
1|while the earth was gay.
1|
1|"I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?" thought
1|Nicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of
1|the house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sonya
1|would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood
1|and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old
1|lime trees fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the
1|barn. The log walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked
1|as if hewn out of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A
1|tree in the garden snapped with the frost, and then all was again
1|perfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the
1|strength of eternal youth and gladness.
1|
1|From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the
1|bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he
1|heard the voice of an old maidservant saying, "Straight, straight,
1|along the path, Miss. Only, don't look back."
1|
1|"I am not afraid," answered Sonya's voice, and along the path toward
1|Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sonya's feet in her
1|thin shoes.
1|
1|Sonya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of
1|paces away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas
1|she had known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman's dress,
1|with tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sonya. She ran rapidly
1|toward him.
1|
1|"Quite different and yet the same," thought Nicholas, looking at her
1|face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the
1|cloak that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and
1|kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt
1|cork. Sonya kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little
1|hands pressed them to his cheeks.
1|
1|"Sonya!... Nicholas!"... was all they said. They ran to the barn and
1|then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back
1|porch.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|When they all drove back from Pelageya Danilovna's, Natasha, who
1|always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss
1|should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sonya with Nicholas and
1|the maids.
1|
1|On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing
1|and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sonya's
1|face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former
1|and his present Sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted
1|again. He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new
1|Sonya, and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the
1|sensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty air with a full breast
1|and, looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling
1|sky, felt himself again in fairyland.
1|
1|"Sonya, is it well with thee?" he asked from time to time.
1|
1|"Yes!" she replied. "And with thee?"
1|
1|When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and
1|ran for a moment to Natasha's sleigh and stood on its wing.
1|
1|"Natasha!" he whispered in French, "do you know I have made up my
1|mind about Sonya?"
1|
1|"Have you told her?" asked Natasha, suddenly beaming all over with
1|joy.
1|
1|"Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...
1|Natasha--are you glad?"
1|
1|"I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I
1|did not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart
1|she has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be
1|happy while Sonya was not," continued Natasha. "Now I am so glad!
1|Well, run back to her."
1|
1|"No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!" cried Nicholas, peering
1|into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual,
1|and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before.
1|"Natasha, it's magical, isn't it?"
1|
1|"Yes," she replied. "You have done splendidly."
1|
1|"Had I seen her before as she is now," thought Nicholas, "I should
1|long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,
1|and all would have been well."
1|
1|"So you are glad and I have done right?"
1|
1|"Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.
1|Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing!
1|I nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of
1|Sonya, for there is nothing but good in her."
1|
1|"Then it's all right?" said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the
1|expression of his sister's face to see if she was in earnest. Then
1|he jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his
1|sleigh. The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and
1|beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting
1|there, and that Circassian was Sonya, and that Sonya was certainly his
1|future happy and loving wife.
1|
1|When they reached home and had told their mother how they had
1|spent the evening at the Melyukovs', the girls went to their
1|bedroom. When they had undressed, but without washing off the cork
1|mustaches, they sat a long time talking of their happiness. They
1|talked of how they would live when they were married, how their
1|husbands would be friends, and how happy they would be. On Natasha's
1|table stood two looking glasses which Dunyasha had prepared
1|beforehand.
1|
1|"Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too
1|good!" said Natasha, rising and going to the looking glasses.
1|
1|"Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you'll see him," said Sonya.
1|
1|Natasha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking
1|glasses, and sat down.
1|
1|"I see someone with a mustache," said Natasha, seeing her own face.
1|
1|"You mustn't laugh, Miss," said Dunyasha.
1|
1|With Sonya's help and the maid's, Natasha got the glass she held
1|into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious
1|expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the
1|receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting
1|(from tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew,
1|in that last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was
1|to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin,
1|she saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the
1|looking glasses.
1|
1|"Why is it others see things and I don't?" she said. "You sit down
1|now, Sonya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I
1|feel so frightened!"
1|
1|Sonya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began
1|looking.
1|
1|"Now, Miss Sonya is sure to see something," whispered Dunyasha;
1|"while you do nothing but laugh."
1|
1|Sonya heard this and Natasha's whisper:
1|
1|"I know she will. She saw something last year."
1|
1|For about three minutes all were silent.
1|
1|"Of course she will!" whispered Natasha, but did not finish...
1|suddenly Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her
1|eyes with her hand.
1|
1|"Oh, Natasha!" she cried.
1|
1|"Did you see? Did you? What was it?" exclaimed Natasha, holding up
1|the looking glass.
1|
1|Sonya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to
1|get up when she heard Natasha say, "Of course she will!" She did not
1|wish to disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha, but it was hard to
1|sit still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped
1|her when she covered her eyes.
1|
1|"You saw him?" urged Natasha, seizing her hand.
1|
1|"Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him," Sonya could not help saying,
1|not yet knowing whom Natasha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"But why shouldn't I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who
1|can tell whether I saw anything or not?" flashed through Sonya's mind.
1|
1|"Yes, I saw him," she said.
1|
1|"How? Standing or lying?"
1|
1|"No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying
1|down."
1|
1|"Andrew lying? Is he ill?" asked Natasha, her frightened eyes
1|fixed on her friend.
1|
1|"No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he
1|turned to me." And when saying this she herself fancied she had really
1|seen what she described.
1|
1|"Well, and then, Sonya?..."
1|
1|"After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and
1|red..."
1|
1|"Sonya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how
1|afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!..." Natasha
1|began, and without replying to Sonya's words of comfort she got into
1|bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless,
1|gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his
1|love for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who
1|had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
1|declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that
1|he might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father
1|would give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the
1|first time, felt that his mother was displeased with him and that,
1|despite her love for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without
1|looking at her son, she sent for her husband and, when he came,
1|tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts, in her son's
1|presence, but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of
1|vexation and left the room. The old count began irresolutely to
1|admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied
1|that he could not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and
1|evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the
1|countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count was always
1|conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family
1|fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry
1|an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya. On this occasion, he
1|was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had
1|not been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could
1|have been wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and
1|his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the
1|family finances.
1|
1|The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son
1|again, but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and, with a
1|cruelty neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to
1|catch Nicholas and for ingratitude. Sonya listened silently with
1|downcast eyes to the countess' cruel words, without understanding what
1|was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her
1|benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this
1|case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She
1|could not help loving the countess and the whole Rostov family, but
1|neither could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his
1|happiness depended on that love. She was silent and sad and did not
1|reply. Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to
1|have an explanation with his mother. He first implored her to
1|forgive him and Sonya and consent to their marriage, then he
1|threatened that if she molested Sonya he would at once marry her
1|secretly.
1|
1|The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her
1|before, replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying
1|without his father's consent, and he could do the same, but that she
1|would never receive that intriguer as her daughter.
1|
1|Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told
1|his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
1|feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time....
1|But he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression
1|of his face caused his mother to await with terror, and which would
1|perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had
1|not time to say it, for Natasha, with a pale and set face, entered the
1|room from the door at which she had been listening.
1|
1|"Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I
1|tell you!..." she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.
1|
1|"Mamma darling, it's not at all so... my poor, sweet darling," she
1|said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of a
1|rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and
1|excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.
1|
1|"Nicholas, I'll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,"
1|said Natasha.
1|
1|Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which
1|she was aiming.
1|
1|The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter's
1|breast, while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.
1|
1|Natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded
1|that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sonya should not
1|be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
1|without his parents' knowledge.
1|
1|Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,
1|to retire from the army and return and marry Sonya, Nicholas, serious,
1|sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,
1|passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his
1|regiment.
1|
1|After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were more
1|depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.
1|
1|Sonya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more
1|so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting
1|toward her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of
1|his affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house
1|and estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they
1|had to go to Moscow. But the countess' health obliged them to delay
1|their departure from day to day.
1|
1|Natasha, who had borne the first period of separation from her
1|betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and
1|impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would
1|have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no
1|advantage to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the
1|most part irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived
1|only in the thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new
1|places and new people that interested him. The more interesting his
1|letters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from
1|giving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial
1|obligation. She could not write, because she could not conceive the
1|possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part
1|of what she expressed by voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him
1|formal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which she attached no
1|importance herself, and in the rough copies of which the countess
1|corrected her mistakes in spelling.
1|
1|There was still no improvement in the countess' health, but it was
1|impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natasha's
1|trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince
1|Andrew was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkonski was spending
1|the winter, and Natasha felt sure he had already arrived.
1|
1|So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sonya
1|and Natasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.

1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|After Prince Andrews engagement to Natasha, Pierre without any
1|apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before.
1|Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his
1|benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to
1|which he had devoted himself with such ardor--all the zest of such a
1|life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and Natasha and the death
1|of Joseph Alexeevich, the news of which reached him almost at the same
1|time. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife
1|who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance
1|with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.
1|And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He
1|ceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began
1|going to the Club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in
1|touch with the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess
1|Helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre
1|felt that she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to
1|Moscow.
1|
1|In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded
1|and fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as
1|soon as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with
1|innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons,
1|the Kremlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh
1|drivers and hovels of the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old Moscovites who
1|desired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days
1|leisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls,
1|and the English Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In
1|Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing
1|gown.
1|
1|Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received
1|Pierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready
1|awaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest,
1|most intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a
1|heedless, genial nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was
1|always empty because it was open to everyone.
1|
1|Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent
1|societies, gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees,
1|Freemasons, churches, and books--no one and nothing met with a refusal
1|from him, and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large
1|sums from him and taken him under their protection, he would have
1|given everything away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the
1|Club without him. As soon as he sank into his place on the sofa
1|after two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded, and talking,
1|disputing, and joking began. When there were quarrels, his kindly
1|smile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists. The Masonic
1|dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there.
1|
1|When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly
1|smile, yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive
1|off somewhere with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the
1|young men. At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies,
1|married and unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of
1|them, he was equally amiable to all, especially after supper. "Il
1|est charmant; il n'a pas de sexe,"* they said of him.
1|
1|
1|*"He is charming; he has no sex."
1|
1|
1|Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there
1|were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.
1|
1|How horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first
1|arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him
1|to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally
1|predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in
1|his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one
1|time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia; then
1|himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then a
1|strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the
1|possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the
1|sinful human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of
1|perfection? Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated
1|his serfs?
1|
1|But instead of all that--here he was, the wealthy husband of an
1|unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and
1|drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the
1|government a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal
1|favorite in Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile
1|himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow
1|gentlemen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years before.
1|
1|Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only
1|living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought
1|of how many, like himself, had entered that life and that Club
1|temporarily, with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it
1|when not a single tooth or hair remained.
1|
1|In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to
1|him that he was quite different and distinct from those other
1|retired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were
1|empty, stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position,
1|"while I am still discontented and want to do something for mankind.
1|But perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and
1|sought something new, a path in life of their own, and like me were
1|brought by force of circumstances, society, and race--by that
1|elemental force against which man is powerless--to the condition I
1|am in," said he to himself in moments of humility; and after living
1|some time in Moscow he no longer despised, but began to grow fond
1|of, to respect, and to pity his comrades in destiny, as he pitied
1|himself.
1|
1|Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust
1|with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
1|acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.
1|"What for? Why? What is going on in the world?" he would ask himself
1|in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to
1|reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by
1|experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste
1|to turn away from them, and took up a book, or hurried of to the
1|Club or to Apollon Nikolaevich's, to exchange the gossip of the town.
1|
1|"Helene, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one
1|of the stupidest women in the world," thought Pierre, "is regarded by
1|people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage
1|to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was
1|great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor
1|Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The
1|Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their
1|victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,
1|also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same
1|fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons
1|swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for
1|their neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections
1|for the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna
1|Seekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that
1|nobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does
1|not understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of
1|injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have
1|built in Moscow forty times forty churches--but yesterday a deserter
1|was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and
1|forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his
1|execution." So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception
1|which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him
1|each time as if it were something new. "I understand the deception and
1|confusion," he thought, "but how am I to tell them all that I see? I
1|have tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their
1|souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears
1|that it must be so! But I--what is to become of me?" thought he. He
1|had the unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of
1|seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of
1|seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a
1|serious part in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes,
1|with evil and deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged
1|in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path
1|of activity. Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It was too
1|dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems, so he
1|abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them. He
1|frequented every kind of society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged
1|in building, and above all--read.
1|
1|He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home,
1|while his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book
1|and began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping
1|to gossip in drawing rooms of the Club, from gossip to carousals and
1|women; from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking
1|became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the
1|doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for
1|him, he drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having
1|poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he
1|felt a pleasant warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his
1|fellows, and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea
1|without probing it deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did
1|he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously
1|had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always
1|conscious of some aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his
1|head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation
1|or read. But under the influence of wine he said to himself: "It
1|doesn't matter. I'll get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but
1|have no time now--I'll think it all out later on!" But the later on
1|never came.
1|
1|In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions
1|appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily
1|picked up a book, and if anyone came to see him he was glad.
1|
1|Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
1|entrenched under the enemy's fire, if they have nothing to do, try
1|hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To
1|Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:
1|some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in
1|women, some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in
1|sport, some in wine, and some in governmental affairs. "Nothing is
1|trivial, and nothing is important, it's all the same--only to save
1|oneself from it as best one can," thought Pierre. "Only not to see it,
1|that dreadful it!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkonski and his
1|daughter moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor
1|Alexander's regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French
1|tendency prevailed there, and this, together with his past and his
1|intellect and his originality, at once made Prince Nicholas
1|Bolkonski an object of particular respect to the Moscovites and the
1|center of the Moscow opposition to the government.
1|
1|The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of
1|senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent
1|events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which
1|he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of
1|this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of
1|respectful veneration--especially of an evening when he came in to tea
1|in his old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone,
1|told his abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and
1|scathing criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned
1|house with its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered
1|footmen, and the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past
1|century) with his gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who
1|were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable
1|spectacle. But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of
1|hours during which they saw their host, there were also twenty-two
1|hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the
1|house continued.
1|
1|Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.
1|There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures--talks with
1|the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills--and
1|she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not
1|go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her
1|go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going
1|out himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening
1|parties. She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She
1|saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received
1|and dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes
1|appeared at their house. She had no friends: during this visit to
1|Moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to
1|her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom she had never been able to be
1|quite frank, had now become unpleasant to her, and for various reasons
1|Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom she had corresponded for
1|the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved to be quite alien to
1|her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the death of her brothers
1|had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow, was in the full
1|whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young men who, she
1|fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at
1|that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last
1|chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or
1|never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile
1|that she now had no one to write to, since Julie--whose presence
1|gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the old
1|emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
1|evenings for years, she regretted Julie's presence and having no one
1|to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one
1|to whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just
1|then. The time for Prince Andrew's return and marriage was
1|approaching, but his request to her to prepare his father for it had
1|not been carried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite
1|hopeless, for at every mention of the young Countess Rostova the old
1|prince (who apart from that was usually in a bad temper) lost
1|control of himself. Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons
1|she gave her six year-old nephew. To her consternation she detected in
1|herself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father's
1|irritability. However often she told herself that she must not get
1|irritable when teaching her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in
1|hand, she sat down to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to
1|pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child--who was
1|already afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry--that at
1|his slightest inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated,
1|raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in
1|the corner. Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to
1|cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following her
1|example, would sob, and without permission would leave his corner,
1|come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort her. But
1|what distressed the princess most of all was her father's
1|irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late
1|amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the
1|ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,
1|it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but
1|this loving despot--the more cruel because he loved her and for that
1|reason tormented himself and her--knew how not merely to hurt and
1|humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to
1|blame for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that
1|tormented Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his
1|ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at
1|the first moment of receiving the news of his son's intentions had
1|occurred to him in jest--that if Andrew got married he himself would
1|marry Bourienne--had evidently pleased him, and latterly he had
1|persistently, and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend
1|her, shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his
1|dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of
1|Bourienne.
1|
1|One day in Moscow in Princess Mary's presence (she thought her
1|father did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her
1|affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few
1|minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary's room
1|smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess
1|Mary hastily wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently unconscious of what she was
1|doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice
1|breaking: "It's horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the
1|weakness..." She did not finish. "Leave my room," she exclaimed, and
1|burst into sobs.
1|
1|Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she
1|noticed that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne
1|should be served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee
1|and from habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew
1|furious, threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to
1|have him conscripted for the army.
1|
1|"He doesn't obey... I said it twice... and he doesn't obey! She is
1|the first person in this house; she's my best friend," cried the
1|prince. "And if you allow yourself," he screamed in a fury, addressing
1|Princess Mary for the first time, "to forget yourself again before her
1|as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master in this
1|house. Go! Don't let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!"
1|
1|Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne's pardon, and also her
1|father's pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged
1|for her intervention.
1|
1|At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in
1|her soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look
1|for his spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not
1|seeing them, or would forget something that had just occurred, or take
1|a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had
1|noticed his feebleness, or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no
1|visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep, letting his
1|napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate. "He is old and
1|feeble, and I dare to condemn him!" she thought at such moments,
1|with a feeling of revulsion against herself.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor--Metivier--who
1|had rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome,
1|amiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an
1|extraordinarily clever doctor. He was received in the best houses
1|not merely as a doctor, but as an equal.
1|
1|Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne's advice had allowed this doctor to visit him
1|and had grown accustomed to him. Metivier came to see the prince about
1|twice a week.
1|
1|On December 6--St. Nicholas' Day and the prince's name day--all
1|Moscow came to the prince's front door but he gave orders to admit
1|no one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom
1|he gave to Princess Mary.
1|
1|Metivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered
1|it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne,* as he
1|told Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on
1|that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods.
1|He had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with
1|everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not
1|to be understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet
1|absorbed querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage,
1|and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and
1|loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor's
1|arrival the morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor,
1|Princess Mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door
1|through which she could hear all that passed in the study.
1|
1|
1|*To force the guard.
1|
1|
1|At first she heard only Metivier's voice, then her father's, then
1|both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung
1|open, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the
1|terrified Metivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his
1|dressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils
1|of his eyes rolled downwards.
1|
1|"You don't understand?" shouted the prince, "but I do! French spy,
1|slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you..."
1|
1|Metivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne
1|who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.
1|
1|"The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head.
1|Keep calm, I will call again tomorrow," said Metivier; and putting his
1|fingers to his lips he hastened away.
1|
1|Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:
1|"Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment's peace in my
1|own house!"
1|
1|After Metivier's departure the old prince called his daughter in,
1|and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a
1|spy had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a
1|list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was
1|that scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he
1|said, he could not have a moment's peace and could not die quietly.
1|
1|"No, ma'am! We must part, we must part! Understand that,
1|understand it! I cannot endure any more," he said, and left the
1|room. Then, as if afraid she might find some means of consolation,
1|he returned and trying to appear calm added: "And don't imagine I have
1|said this in a moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and
1|it will be carried out--we must part; so find some place for
1|yourself...." But he could not restrain himself and with the virulence
1|of which only one who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself,
1|he shook his fists at her and screamed:
1|
1|"If only some fool would marry her!" Then he slammed the door,
1|sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.
1|
1|At two o'clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.
1|
1|These guests--the famous Count Rostopchin, Prince Lopukhin with
1|his nephew, General Chatrov an old war comrade of the prince's, and of
1|the younger generation Pierre and Boris Drubetskoy--awaited the prince
1|in the drawing room.
1|
1|Boris, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been
1|anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, and had
1|contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his
1|case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his
1|house.
1|
1|The prince's house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
1|society, but his little circle--though not much talked about in
1|town--was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.
1|Boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in
1|his presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St. Nicholas' Day, and
1|Rostopchin had replied that he could not come:
1|
1|"On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince
1|Nicholas Bolkonski."
1|
1|"Oh, yes, yes!" replied the commander in chief. "How is he?..."
1|
1|The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty
1|old-fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn
1|gathering of a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low
1|tones. Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary
1|seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual. The guests were
1|reluctant to address her, feeling that she was in no mood for their
1|conversation. Count Rostopchin alone kept the conversation going,
1|now relating the latest town news, and now the latest political
1|gossip.
1|
1|Lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the
1|conversation. Prince Bolkonski listened as a presiding judge
1|receives a report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word,
1|showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him. The
1|tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of
1|what was being done in the political world. Incidents were related
1|evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to
1|worse, but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker
1|always stopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond which his
1|criticism might touch the sovereign himself.
1|
1|At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon's
1|seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and the Russian Note,
1|hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.
1|
1|"Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel," said
1|Count Rostopchin, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times
1|before. "One only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the
1|crowned heads. Now the Pope's turn has come and Bonaparte doesn't
1|scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church--yet all keep
1|silent! Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the
1|Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and even..." Count Rostopchin paused,
1|feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was
1|impossible.
1|
1|"Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of
1|Oldenburg," said Prince Bolkonski. "He shifts the Dukes about as I
1|might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan
1|estates."
1|
1|"The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength
1|of character and resignation," remarked Boris, joining in
1|respectfully.
1|
1|He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the
1|honor of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkonski glanced at
1|the young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his
1|mind, evidently considering him too young.
1|
1|"I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was
1|surprised how badly the Note was worded," remarked Count Rostopchin in
1|the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.
1|
1|Pierre looked at Rostopchin with naive astonishment, not
1|understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the
1|Note.
1|
1|"Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded," he asked, "so
1|long as its substance is forcible?"
1|
1|"My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should
1|be easy to have a good style," returned Count Rostopchin.
1|
1|Pierre now understood the count's dissatisfaction with the wording
1|of the Note.
1|
1|"One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up," remarked
1|the old prince. "There in Petersburg they are always writing--not
1|notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a whole
1|volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!" and he
1|laughed unnaturally.
1|
1|There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general
1|cleared his throat to draw attention.
1|
1|"Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The
1|figure cut by the new French ambassador."
1|
1|"Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His
1|Majesty's presence."
1|
1|"His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the
1|march past," continued the general, "and it seems the ambassador
1|took no notice and allowed himself to reply that: 'We in France pay no
1|attention to such trifles!' The Emperor did not condescend to reply.
1|At the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to
1|address him."
1|
1|All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it
1|was impossible to pass any judgment.
1|
1|"Impudent fellows!" said the prince. "You know Metivier? I turned him
1|out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in spite
1|of my request that they should let no one in," he went on, glancing
1|angrily at his daughter.
1|
1|And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and
1|the reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy. Though these
1|reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.
1|
1|After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to
1|congratulate the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.
1|
1|He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,
1|clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told
1|her that he had not forgotten the morning's talk, that his decision
1|remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his
1|speaking of it to her now.
1|
1|When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the
1|old men sat together.
1|
1|Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
1|impending war.
1|
1|He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long
1|as we sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into
1|European affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit.
1|"We ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political
1|interests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only
1|thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will
1|never dare to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!"
1|
1|"How can we fight the French, Prince?" said Count Rostopchin. "Can
1|we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our
1|youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our
1|Kingdom of Heaven."
1|
1|He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.
1|
1|"French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you
1|turned Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a
1|Frenchman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their
1|knees. I went to a party last night, and there out of five ladies
1|three were Roman Catholics and had the Pope's indulgence for doing
1|woolwork on Sundays. And they themselves sit there nearly naked,
1|like the signboards at our Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when
1|one looks at our young people, Prince, one would like to take Peter
1|the Great's old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the
1|Russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them."
1|
1|All were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchin with a smile
1|and wagged his head approvingly.
1|
1|"Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!" said Rostopchin,
1|getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to
1|the prince.
1|
1|"Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of
1|hearing him!" said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and
1|offering his cheek to be kissed.
1|
1|Following Rostopchin's example the others also rose.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men's talk and
1|faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only
1|wondered whether the guests had all observed her father's hostile
1|attitude toward her. She did not even notice the special attentions
1|and amiabilities shown her during dinner by Boris Drubetskoy, who
1|was visiting them for the third time already.
1|
1|Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to
1|Pierre, who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of
1|the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and
1|they were left alone in the drawing room.
1|
1|"May I stay a little longer?" he said, letting his stout body sink
1|into an armchair beside her.
1|
1|"Oh yes," she answered. "You noticed nothing?" her look asked.
1|
1|Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight
1|before him and smiled quietly.
1|
1|"Have you known that young man long, Princess?" he asked.
1|
1|"Who?"
1|
1|"Drubetskoy."
1|
1|"No, not long..."
1|
1|"Do you like him?"
1|
1|"Yes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?" said
1|Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning's conversation with
1|her father.
1|
1|"Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
1|Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
1|heiress."
1|
1|"You have observed that?" said Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Yes," returned Pierre with a smile, "and this young man now manages
1|matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. I
1|can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay
1|siege to--you or Mademoiselle Julie Karagina. He is very attentive
1|to her."
1|
1|"He visits them?"
1|
1|"Yes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?" said
1|Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good
1|humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his
1|diary.
1|
1|"No," replied Princess Mary.
1|
1|"To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is
1|very melancholy with Mademoiselle Karagina," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Really?" asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre's kindly face and
1|still thinking of her own sorrow. "It would be a relief," thought she,
1|"if I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should
1|like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would
1|be a relief. He would give me advice."
1|
1|"Would you marry him?"
1|
1|"Oh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!"
1|she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice.
1|"Ah, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that..."
1|she went on in a trembling voice, "that you can do nothing for him but
1|grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only
1|one thing left--to go away, but where could I go?"
1|
1|"What is wrong? What is it, Princess?"
1|
1|But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst
1|into tears.
1|
1|"I don't know what is the matter with me today. Don't take any
1|notice--forget what I have said!"
1|
1|Pierre's gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the
1|princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him;
1|but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said,
1|that she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no
1|trouble except the one he knew of--that Prince Andrew's marriage
1|threatened to cause a rupture between father and son.
1|
1|"Have you any news of the Rostovs?" she asked, to change the
1|subject. "I was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting
1|Andrew any day. I should like them to meet here."
1|
1|"And how does he now regard the matter?" asked Pierre, referring
1|to the old prince.
1|
1|Princess Mary shook her head.
1|
1|"What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The
1|thing is impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first
1|moments. I wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her.
1|You have known them a long time," said Princess Mary. "Tell me
1|honestly the whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you
1|think of her?--The real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so
1|much doing this against his father's will that I should like to
1|know..."
1|
1|An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and
1|repeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on
1|the princess' part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that
1|he should disapprove of Andrew's choice; but in reply he said what
1|he felt rather than what he thought.
1|
1|"I don't know how to answer your question," he said, blushing
1|without knowing why. "I really don't know what sort of girl she is;
1|I can't analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I
1|don't know. That is all one can say about her."
1|
1|Princess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: "Yes,
1|that's what I expected and feared."
1|
1|"Is she clever?" she asked.
1|
1|Pierre considered.
1|
1|"I think not," he said, "and yet--yes. She does not deign to be
1|clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all."
1|
1|Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.
1|
1|"Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do."
1|
1|"I hear they are expected very soon," said Pierre.
1|
1|Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her
1|future sister-in-law as soon as the Rostovs arrived and to try to
1|accustom the old prince to her.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|Boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg,
1|so with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered
1|between the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though
1|Princess Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than
1|Julie, he, without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to
1|her. When they had last met on the old prince's name day, she had
1|answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently
1|not listening to what he was saying.
1|
1|Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a
1|manner peculiar to herself.
1|
1|She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become
1|very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself
1|not merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She
1|was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a
1|very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew
1|the less dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could
1|associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and
1|the animated company that assembled at her house, without incurring
1|any obligation. A man who would have been afraid ten years before of
1|going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there,
1|for fear of compromising her and committing himself, would now go
1|boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a
1|sexless acquaintance.
1|
1|That winter the Karagins' house was the most agreeable and
1|hospitable in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner
1|parties, a large company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day,
1|supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning. Julie never
1|missed a ball, a promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of
1|the latest fashion. But in spite of that she seemed to be
1|disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not
1|believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the joys of life,
1|and expected peace only "yonder." She adopted the tone of one who
1|has suffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either lost
1|the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of
1|the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light, and had
1|even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life.
1|This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing herself, did not
1|hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time
1|pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to
1|the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused himself with
1|society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts rimes, which
1|were in vogue at the Karagins'. Only a few of these young men, among
1|them Boris, entered more deeply into Julie's melancholy, and with
1|these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of
1|all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums filled with
1|mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.
1|
1|To Boris, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early
1|disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of
1|friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and
1|showed him her album. Boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote:
1|"Rustic trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me."
1|
1|On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:
1|
1|    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.
1|    Ah! contre les douleurs il n'y a pas d'autre asile.*
1|
1|
1|*Death gives relief and death is peaceful.
1|
1|
1|Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.
1|
1|Julie said this was charming
1|
1|"There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy," she
1|said to Boris, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a
1|book. "It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness
1|and despair, showing the possibility of consolation."
1|
1|In reply Boris wrote these lines:
1|
1|    Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible,
1|    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,
1|    Tendre melancholie, ah, viens me consoler,
1|    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,
1|    Et mele une douceur secrete
1|    A ces pleurs que je sens couler.*
1|
1|
1|*Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,
1|
1| Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,
1|
1| Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,
1|
1| Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,
1|
1| And mingle a secret sweetness
1|
1| With these tears that I feel to be flowing.
1|
1|
1|For Boris, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Boris
1|read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the
1|reading because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large
1|gatherings Julie and Boris looked on one another as the only souls who
1|understood one another in a world of indifferent people.
1|
1|Anna Mikhaylovna, who often visited the Karagins, while playing
1|cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie's dowry
1|(she was to have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests).
1|Anna Mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to
1|the wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.
1|
1|"You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie," she said to
1|the daughter. "Boris says his soul finds repose at your house. He
1|has suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive," said she to
1|the mother. "Ah, my dear, I can't tell you how fond I have grown of
1|Julie latterly," she said to her son. "But who could help loving
1|her? She is an angelic being! Ah, Boris, Boris!"--she paused. "And how
1|I pity her mother," she went on; "today she showed me her accounts and
1|letters from Penza (they have enormous estates there), and she, poor
1|thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!"
1|
1|Boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother.
1|He laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had
1|to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Penza and
1|Nizhegorod estates.
1|
1|Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy
1|adorer and was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of
1|repulsion for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for her
1|artificiality, and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility
1|of real love still restrained Boris. His leave was expiring. He
1|spent every day and whole days at the Karagins', and every day on
1|thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose
1|tomorrow. But in Julie's presence, looking at her red face and chin
1|(nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of
1|continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural
1|rapture of married bliss, Boris could not utter the decisive words,
1|though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of
1|those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of
1|the income from them. Julie saw Boris' indecision, and sometimes the
1|thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him, but her
1|feminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation, and
1|she told herself that he was only shy from love. Her melancholy,
1|however, began to turn to irritability, and not long before Boris'
1|departure she formed a definite plan of action. Just as Boris' leave
1|of absence was expiring, Anatole Kuragin made his appearance in
1|Moscow, and of course in the Karagins' drawing room, and Julie,
1|suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and very attentive
1|to Kuragin.
1|
1|"My dear," said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son, "I know from a reliable
1|source that Prince Vasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him
1|married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for
1|her. What do you think of it, my dear?"
1|
1|The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that
1|whole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing
1|all the revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally
1|apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another,
1|and especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Boris.
1|He drove to the Karagins' with the firm intention of proposing.
1|Julie met him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had
1|enjoyed yesterday's ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though
1|Boris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore
1|meant to be tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine
1|inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how
1|their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them.
1|Julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs
1|variety, and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone.
1|
1|"Then I should advise you..." Boris began, wishing to sting her; but
1|at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have
1|to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly
1|wasted his efforts--which was a thing he never allowed to happen.
1|
1|He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes
1|to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and
1|said:
1|
1|"I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary..."
1|
1|He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability
1|had suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were
1|fixed on him with greedy expectation. "I can always arrange so as
1|not to see her often," thought Boris. "The affair has been begun and
1|must be finished!" He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and
1|said:
1|
1|"You know my feelings for you!"
1|
1|There was no need to say more: Julie's face shone with triumph and
1|self-satisfaction; but she forced Boris to say all that is said on
1|such occasions--that he loved her and had never loved any other
1|woman more than her. She knew that for the Penza estates and
1|Nizhegorod forests she could demand this, and she received what she
1|demanded.
1|
1|The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom
1|and melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house
1|in Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant
1|wedding.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|At the end of January old Count Rostov went to Moscow with Natasha
1|and Sonya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it
1|was impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in
1|Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
1|Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his
1|future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkonski while he was in
1|Moscow could not be missed. The Rostovs' Moscow house had not been
1|heated that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the
1|countess was not with them, the count decided to stay with Marya
1|Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had long been pressing her hospitality
1|on them.
1|
1|Late one evening the Rostovs' four sleighs drove into Marya
1|Dmitrievna's courtyard in the old Konyusheny street. Marya
1|Dmitrievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter,
1|and her sons were all in the service.
1|
1|She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,
1|loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
1|to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation--the possibility of
1|which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing
1|jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:
1|on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
1|affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after
1|dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there
1|were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing
1|meal at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she
1|played a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a
1|new book read to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception
1|and went out to pay visits, and then only to the most important
1|persons in the town.
1|
1|She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the
1|pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the
1|Rostovs and their servants. Marya Dmitrievna, with her spectacles
1|hanging down on her nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall
1|doorway looking with a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might
1|have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately
1|turn them out, had she not at the same time been giving careful
1|instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and
1|their belongings.
1|
1|"The count's things? Bring them here," she said, pointing to the
1|portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. "The young ladies'? There to the
1|left. Now what are you dawdling for?" she cried to the maids. "Get the
1|samovar ready!... You've grown plumper and prettier," she remarked,
1|drawing Natasha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by
1|the hood. "Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!" she
1|shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand. "You're half
1|frozen, I'm sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sonya dear!" she
1|added, turning to Sonya and indicating by this French greeting her
1|slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.
1|
1|When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things
1|and tidied themselves up after their journey, Marya Dmitrievna
1|kissed them all in due order.
1|
1|"I'm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was
1|high time," she said, giving Natasha a significant look. "The old
1|man is here and his son's expected any day. You'll have to make his
1|acquaintance. But we'll speak of that later on," she added, glancing at
1|Sonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her
1|presence. "Now listen," she said to the count. "What do you want
1|tomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshin?" she crooked one of her
1|fingers. "The sniveling Anna Mikhaylovna? That's two. She's here
1|with her son. The son is getting married! Then Bezukhov, eh? He is
1|here too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping
1|after him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them"--and she
1|pointed to the girls--"tomorrow I'll take them first to the Iberian
1|shrine of the Mother of God, and then we'll drive to the
1|Super-Rogue's. I suppose you'll have everything new. Don't judge by
1|me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Irina
1|Vasilevna came to see me; she was an awful sight--looked as if she had
1|put two barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without
1|some new fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?" she asked
1|the count sternly.
1|
1|"One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a
1|purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If
1|you will be so kind, I'll fix a time and go down to the estate just
1|for a day, and leave my lassies with you."
1|
1|"All right. All right. They'll be safe with me, as safe as in
1|Chancery! I'll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet
1|them a bit," said Marya Dmitrievna, touching her goddaughter and
1|favorite, Natasha, on the cheek with her large hand.
1|
1|Next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian
1|shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so
1|afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at
1|a loss merely to get rid of her. Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the
1|whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the
1|room except Natasha, and then called her pet to her armchair.
1|
1|"Well, now we'll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.
1|You've hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I've known
1|him since he was so high." She held her hand a couple of feet from the
1|ground. Natasha blushed happily. "I like him and all his family. Now
1|listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son's
1|marrying. The old fellow's crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a
1|child and can shift without him, but it's not nice to enter a family
1|against a father's will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.
1|You're a clever girl and you'll know how to manage. Be kind, and use
1|your wits. Then all will be well."
1|
1|Natasha remained silent, from shyness Marya Dmitrievna supposed, but
1|really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her
1|love of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human
1|affairs that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince
1|Andrew, he loved her only, and was to come one of these days and
1|take her. She wanted nothing more.
1|
1|"You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your
1|future sister-in-law. 'Husbands' sisters bring up blisters,' but
1|this one wouldn't hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two
1|together. Tomorrow you'll go with your father to see her. Be very nice
1|and affectionate to her: you're younger than she. When he comes, he'll
1|find you already know his sister and father and are liked by them.
1|Am I right or not? Won't that be best?"
1|
1|"Yes, it will," Natasha answered reluctantly.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Next day, by Marya Dmitrievna's advice, Count Rostov took Natasha to
1|call on Prince Nicholas Bolkonski. The count did not set out
1|cheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well
1|remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the
1|time of the enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he
1|had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his
1|full quota of men. Natasha, on the other hand, having put on her
1|best gown, was in the highest spirits. "They can't help liking me,"
1|she thought. "Everybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do
1|anything they wish, so ready to be fond of him--for being his
1|father--and of her--for being his sister--that there is no reason
1|for them not to like me..."
1|
1|They drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvizhenka and
1|entered the vestibule.
1|
1|"Well, the Lord have mercy on us!" said the count, half in jest,
1|half in earnest; but Natasha noticed that her father was flurried on
1|entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the
1|prince and princess were at home.
1|
1|When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
1|servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
1|another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a
1|maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning
1|the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced
1|to the Rostovs that the prince was not receiving, but that the
1|princess begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the
1|visitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and
1|daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess'
1|room. The princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in
1|patches, ran in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly
1|trying to appear cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess
1|Mary did not like Natasha. She thought her too fashionably dressed,
1|frivolously gay and vain. She did not at all realize that before
1|having seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by
1|involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by
1|jealousy of her brother's love for her. Apart from this insuperable
1|antipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated just then because on
1|the Rostovs' being announced, the old prince had shouted that he did
1|not wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but
1|they were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive
1|them, but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some
1|freak, as he seemed much upset by the Rostovs' visit.
1|
1|"There, my dear princess, I've brought you my songstress," said
1|the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old
1|prince might appear. "I am so glad you should get to know one
1|another... very sorry the prince is still ailing," and after a few
1|more commonplace remarks he rose. "If you'll allow me to leave my
1|Natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I'll drive
1|round to see Anna Semenovna, it's quite near in the Dogs' Square,
1|and then I'll come back for her."
1|
1|The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told
1|his daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk
1|to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of
1|encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention
1|this to his daughter, but Natasha noticed her father's nervousness and
1|anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still
1|angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold
1|and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of
1|anybody. The princess told the count that she would be delighted,
1|and only begged him to stay longer at Anna Semenovna's, and he
1|departed.
1|
1|Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary--who
1|wished to have a tete-a-tete with Natasha--Mademoiselle Bourienne
1|remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements
1|and theaters. Natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had
1|noticed in the anteroom, by her father's nervousness, and by the
1|unnatural manner of the princess who--she thought--was making a
1|favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her. She did
1|not like Princess Mary, whom she thought very plain, affected, and
1|dry. Natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an
1|offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still more. After five
1|minutes of irksome, constrained conversation, they heard the sound
1|of slippered feet rapidly approaching. Princess Mary looked
1|frightened.
1|
1|The door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white
1|nightcap, came in.
1|
1|"Ah, madam!" he began. "Madam, Countess... Countess Rostova, if I am
1|not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not
1|know, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with
1|a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg
1|you to excuse me... God is my witness, I didn't know-" he repeated,
1|stressing the word "God" so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
1|Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at
1|her father or at Natasha.
1|
1|Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.
1|
1|"I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not
1|know," muttered the old man, and after looking Natasha over from
1|head to foot he went out.
1|
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
1|apparition and began speaking about the prince's indisposition.
1|Natasha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the
1|longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater
1|grew their antipathy to one another.
1|
1|When the count returned, Natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened
1|to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who
1|could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
1|hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. "I couldn't begin
1|talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman," thought
1|Natasha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary.
1|She knew what she ought to have said to Natasha, but she had been
1|unable to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and
1|because, without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of
1|the marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess
1|Mary went up hurriedly to Natasha, took her by the hand, and said with
1|a deep sigh:
1|
1|"Wait, I must..."
1|
1|Natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.
1|
1|"Dear Natalie," said Princess Mary, "I want you to know that I am
1|glad my brother has found happiness...."
1|
1|She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Natasha
1|noticed this and guessed its reason.
1|
1|"I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,"
1|she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears
1|choking her.
1|
1|"What have I said and what have I done?" thought she, as soon as she
1|was out of the room.
1|
1|They waited a long time for Natasha to come to dinner that day.
1|She sat in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing.
1|Sonya stood beside her, kissing her hair.
1|
1|"Natasha, what is it about?" she asked. "What do they matter to you?
1|It will all pass, Natasha."
1|
1|"But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I..."
1|
1|"Don't talk about it, Natasha. It wasn't your fault so why should
1|you mind? Kiss me," said Sonya.
1|
1|Natasha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed
1|her wet face against her.
1|
1|"I can't tell you, I don't know. No one's to blame," said
1|Natasha--"It's my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn't he
1|come?..."
1|
1|She came in to dinner with red eyes. Marya Dmitrievna, who knew
1|how the prince had received the Rostovs, pretended not to notice how
1|upset Natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the
1|count and the other guests.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|That evening the Rostovs went to the Opera, for which Marya
1|Dmitrievna had taken a box.
1|
1|Natasha did not want to go, but could not refuse Marya
1|Dmitrievna's kind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she
1|came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and
1|looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty, very
1|pretty, she felt even more sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.
1|
1|"O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but
1|differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply
1|embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those
1|searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me,
1|and then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes--how
1|I see those eyes!" thought Natasha. "And what do his father and sister
1|matter to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those
1|eyes, with his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not
1|think of him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for
1|the present. I can't bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!"
1|and she turned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry.
1|"And how can Sonya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so
1|long and so patiently?" thought she, looking at Sonya, who also came
1|in quite ready, with a fan in her hand. "No, she's altogether
1|different. I can't!"
1|
1|Natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
1|enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at
1|once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words
1|of love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside
1|her father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps
1|flickering on the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in
1|love, and forgot where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into
1|the line of carriages, the Rostovs' carriage drove up to the
1|theater, its wheels squeaking over the snow. Natasha and Sonya,
1|holding up their dresses, jumped out quickly. The count got out helped
1|by the footmen, and, passing among men and women who were entering and
1|the program sellers, they all three went along the corridor to the
1|first row of boxes. Through the closed doors the music was already
1|audible.
1|
1|"Natasha, your hair!..." whispered Sonya.
1|
1|An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
1|opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the
1|door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
1|shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered
1|before their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of
1|feminine envy at Natasha. The curtain had not yet risen and the
1|overture was being played. Natasha, smoothing her gown, went in with
1|Sonya and sat down, scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite.
1|A sensation she had not experienced for a long time--that of
1|hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck--suddenly
1|affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole
1|crowd of memories, desires and emotions associated with that feeling.
1|
1|The two remarkably pretty girls, Natasha and Sonya, with Count
1|Rostov who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted
1|general attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natasha's
1|engagement to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostovs had lived in
1|the country ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who
1|was making one of the best matches in Russia.
1|
1|Natasha's looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the
1|country, and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly
1|pretty. She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and
1|beauty, combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her
1|black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her
1|delicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the
1|box, while, evidently unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in
1|time to the music, crumpling her program. "Look, there's Alenina,"
1|said Sonya, "with her mother, isn't it?"
1|
1|"Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!" remarked
1|the count.
1|
1|"Look at our Anna Mikhaylovna--what a headdress she has on!"
1|
1|"The Karagins, Julie--and Boris with them. One can see at once
1|that they're engaged...."
1|
1|"Drubetskoy has proposed?"
1|
1|"Oh yes, I heard it today," said Shinshin, coming into the
1|Rostovs' box.
1|
1|Natasha looked in the direction in which her father's eyes were
1|turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on
1|her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck--which
1|Natasha knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and
1|leaning over with an ear to Julie's mouth, was Boris' handsome
1|smoothly brushed head. He looked at the Rostovs from under his brows
1|and said something, smiling, to his betrothed.
1|
1|"They are talking about us, about me and him!" thought Natasha. "And
1|he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn't trouble
1|themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of
1|them."
1|
1|Behind them sat Anna Mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and
1|with a happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their
1|box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which
1|Natasha knew so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly
1|remembered all that had been so humiliating in her morning's visit.
1|
1|"What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,
1|better not think of it--not till he comes back!" she told herself, and
1|began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the
1|stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against the
1|orchestra rail, stood Dolokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair
1|brushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,
1|well aware that he was attracting everyone's attention, yet as much at
1|ease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow's
1|most brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.
1|
1|The count, laughing, nudged the blushing Sonya and pointed to her
1|former adorer.
1|
1|"Do you recognize him?" said he. "And where has he sprung from?"
1|he asked, turning to Shinshin. "Didn't he vanish somewhere?"
1|
1|"He did," replied Shinshin. "He was in the Caucasus and ran away
1|from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling
1|prince in Persia, where he killed the Shah's brother. Now all the
1|Moscow ladies are mad about him! It's 'Dolokhov the Persian' that does
1|it! We never hear a word but Dolokhov is mentioned. They swear by him,
1|they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet. Dolokhov
1|and Anatole Kuragin have turned all our ladies' heads."
1|
1|A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
1|plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string
1|of large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk
1|dress and took a long time settling into her place.
1|
1|Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and
1|pearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the
1|pearls. While Natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time
1|the lady looked round and, meeting the count's eyes, nodded to him and
1|smiled. She was the Countess Bezukhova, Pierre's wife, and the
1|count, who knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.
1|
1|"Have you been here long, Countess?" he inquired. "I'll call, I'll
1|call to kiss your hand. I'm here on business and have brought my girls
1|with me. They say Semenova acts marvelously. Count Pierre never used
1|to forget us. Is he here?"
1|
1|"Yes, he meant to look in," answered Helene, and glanced attentively
1|at Natasha.
1|
1|Count Rostov resumed his seat.
1|
1|"Handsome, isn't she?" he whispered to Natasha.
1|
1|"Wonderful!" answered Natasha. "She's a woman one could easily
1|fall in love with."
1|
1|Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the
1|conductor tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in
1|the stalls, and the curtain rose.
1|
1|As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent,
1|and all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and
1|all the women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole
1|attention with eager curiosity to the stage. Natasha too began to look
1|at it.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides
1|was some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a
1|cloth stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls
1|in red bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk
1|dress sat apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of
1|green cardboard was glued. They all sang something. When they had
1|finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter's box
1|and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding
1|a plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing, waving his
1|arms about.
1|
1|First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang,
1|then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man
1|fingered the hand of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to
1|start singing with her. They sang together and everyone in the theater
1|began clapping and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage--who
1|represented lovers--began smiling, spreading out their arms, and
1|bowing.
1|
1|After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood,
1|all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha. She could not follow
1|the opera nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted
1|cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke,
1|and sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it was
1|all meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously false and
1|unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused
1|at them. She looked at the faces of the audience, seeking in them
1|the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced, but
1|they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage, and
1|expressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned. "I suppose it has
1|to be like this!" she thought. She kept looking round in turn at the
1|rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women
1|in the boxes, especially at Helene in the next box, who--apparently
1|quite unclothed--sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her
1|eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded the
1|whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little by
1|little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
1|experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she
1|was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought,
1|the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through
1|her mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box
1|and singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to
1|touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then
1|to lean over to Helene and tickle her.
1|
1|At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song,
1|a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostovs' box
1|creaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. "There's
1|Kuragin!" whispered Shinshin. Countess Bezukhova turned smiling to the
1|newcomer, and Natasha, following the direction of that look, saw an
1|exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a
1|self-assured yet courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kuragin whom
1|she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was
1|now in an adjutant's uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot.
1|He moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous
1|had he not been so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn
1|such an expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though
1|the performance was proceeding, he walked deliberately down the
1|carpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his
1|handsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at Natasha he
1|approached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her
1|box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a
1|motion toward Natasha.
1|
1|"Mais charmante!" said he, evidently referring to Natasha, who did
1|not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of
1|his lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and
1|sat down beside Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and
1|offhand way that Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He
1|winked at him gaily, smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra
1|screen.
1|
1|"How like the brother is to the sister," remarked the count. "And
1|how handsome they both are!"
1|
1|Shinshin, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some
1|intrigue of Kuragin's in Moscow, and Natasha tried to overhear it just
1|because he had said she was "charmante."
1|
1|The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about,
1|going out and coming in.
1|
1|Boris came to the Rostovs' box, received their congratulations
1|very simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile
1|conveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fiancee's invitation to her wedding,
1|and went away. Natasha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and
1|congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Boris with whom she
1|had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,
1|everything seemed simple and natural.
1|
1|The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way, and
1|Natasha gave Boris a similar smile.
1|
1|Helene's box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
1|distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another
1|in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.
1|
1|During the whole of that entr'acte Kuragin stood with Dolokhov in
1|front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostovs' box. Natasha
1|knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even
1|turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its
1|most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act Pierre
1|appeared in the stalls. The Rostovs had not seen him since their
1|arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since
1|Natasha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing
1|anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at
1|and indicating the Rostovs' box. On seeing Natasha Pierre grew
1|animated and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box.
1|When he got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to
1|her for a long time. While conversing with Pierre, Natasha heard a
1|man's voice in Countess Bezukhova's box and something told her it
1|was Kuragin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed
1|straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that
1|it seemed strange to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be
1|so sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.
1|
1|In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there
1|was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were
1|raised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep
1|notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black
1|cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands. They began
1|waving their arms. Then some other people ran in and began dragging
1|away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue.
1|They did not drag her away at once, but sang with her for a long
1|time and then at last dragged her off, and behind the scenes something
1|metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a
1|prayer. All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the
1|enthusiastic shouts of the audience.
1|
1|During this act every time Natasha looked toward the stalls she
1|saw Anatole Kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,
1|staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her
1|and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.
1|
1|When the second act was over Countess Bezukhova rose, turned to
1|the Rostovs' box--her whole bosom completely exposed--beckoned the old
1|count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had
1|entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.
1|
1|"Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters," said she. "The
1|whole town is singing their praises and I don't even know then!"
1|
1|Natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so
1|pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with
1|pleasure.
1|
1|"I want to become a Moscovite too, now," said Helene. "How is it
1|you're not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?"
1|
1|Countess Bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a
1|fascinating woman. She could say what she did not think--especially
1|what was flattering--quite simply and naturally.
1|
1|"Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I
1|am not staying here long this time--nor are you--I will try to amuse
1|them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get
1|to know you," said she to Natasha with her stereotyped and lovely
1|smile. "I had heard about you from my page, Drubetskoy. Have you heard
1|he is getting married? And also from my husband's friend Bolkonski,
1|Prince Andrew Bolkonski," she went on with special emphasis,
1|implying that she knew of his relation to Natasha. To get better
1|acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her
1|box for the rest of the performance, and Natasha moved over to it.
1|
1|The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many
1|candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on
1|the walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a
1|queen. The king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang
1|something badly and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had
1|been first in white and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and
1|stood beside the throne with her hair down. She sang something
1|mournfully, addressing the queen, but the king waved his arm severely,
1|and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began
1|dancing all together. Then the violins played very shrilly and merrily
1|and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms, separating
1|from the others, went behind the wings, adjusted her bodice,
1|returned to the middle of the stage, and began jumping and striking
1|one foot rapidly against the other. In the stalls everyone clapped and
1|shouted "bravo!" Then one of the men went into a corner of the
1|stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly,
1|and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet
1|about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty thousand rubles
1|a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes, and galleries
1|began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the man
1|stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men
1|and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the
1|sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm
1|came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
1|orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number
1|away, and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise
1|and clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone
1|began shouting: "Duport! Duport! Duport!" Natasha no longer thought
1|this strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.
1|
1|"Isn't Duport delightful?" Helene asked her.
1|
1|"Oh, yes," replied Natasha.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|During the entr'acte a whiff of cold air came into Helene's box, the
1|door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush
1|against anyone.
1|
1|"Let me introduce my brother to you," said Helene, her eyes shifting
1|uneasily from Natasha to Anatole.
1|
1|Natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young
1|officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was
1|as handsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her
1|and told her he had long wished to have this happiness--ever since the
1|Naryshkins' ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered
1|pleasure of seeing her. Kuragin was much more sensible and simple with
1|women than among men. He talked boldly and naturally, and Natasha
1|was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was
1|nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk,
1|but that on the contrary his smile was most naive, cheerful, and
1|good-natured.
1|
1|Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
1|previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage.
1|
1|"And do you know, Countess," he said, suddenly addressing her as
1|an old, familiar acquaintance, "we are getting up a costume
1|tournament; you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We
1|shall all meet at the Karagins'! Please come! No! Really, eh?" said
1|he.
1|
1|While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,
1|her neck, and her bare arms. Natasha knew for certain that he was
1|enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel
1|constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt
1|that he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his
1|eye so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking
1|into his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that
1|barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other
1|men. She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come
1|to feel herself terribly near to this man. When she turned away she
1|feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her
1|on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that
1|they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man.
1|Natasha kept turning to Helene and to her father, as if asking what it
1|all meant, but Helene was engaged in conversation with a general and
1|did not answer her look, and her father's eyes said nothing but what
1|they always said: "Having a good time? Well, I'm glad of it!"
1|
1|During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole's
1|prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natasha, to
1|break the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the
1|question and blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she
1|was doing something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage
1|her.
1|
1|"At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant
1|ce sont les jolies femmes,* isn't that so? But now I like it very much
1|indeed," he said, looking at her significantly. "You'll come to the
1|costume tournament, Countess? Do come!" and putting out his hand to
1|her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, "You will be the
1|prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as
1|a pledge!"
1|
1|
1|*Are the pretty women.
1|
1|
1|Natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
1|himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an
1|improper intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if
1|she had not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she
1|felt that he was there, behind, so close behind her.
1|
1|"How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?" she asked
1|herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked
1|straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the
1|good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just
1|as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt
1|with horror that no barrier lay between him and her.
1|
1|The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay.
1|Natasha went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive
1|to the world she found herself in. All that was going on before her
1|now seemed quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous
1|thoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country
1|did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote
1|past.
1|
1|In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his
1|arm about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he
1|disappeared down below. That was the only part of the fourth act
1|that Natasha saw. She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of
1|this was Kuragin whom she could not help watching. As they were
1|leaving the theater Anatole came up to them, called their carriage,
1|and helped them in. As he was putting Natasha in he pressed her arm
1|above the elbow. Agitated and flushed she turned round. He was looking
1|at her with glittering eyes, smiling tenderly.
1|
1|
1|Only after she had reached home was Natasha able clearly to think
1|over what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince
1|Andrew she was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after
1|the opera, she gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the
1|room.
1|
1|"O God! I am lost!" she said to herself. "How could I let him?"
1|She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to
1|realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to
1|understand what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark,
1|obscure, and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater
1|where the bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped
1|about to the music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the
1|nearly naked Helene with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried
1|"bravo!"--there in the presence of that Helene it had all seemed clear
1|and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.
1|"What is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this
1|gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?" she thought.
1|
1|Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have told all
1|she was feeling. She knew that Sonya with her severe and simple
1|views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at
1|such a confession. So Natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by
1|herself.
1|
1|"Am I spoiled for Andrew's love or not?" she asked herself, and with
1|soothing irony replied: "What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen
1|to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn't lead him on at all.
1|Nobody will know and I shall never see him again," she told herself.
1|"So it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to
1|repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why 'still?' O God, why
1|isn't he here?" Natasha quieted herself for a moment, but again some
1|instinct told her that though all this was true, and though nothing
1|had happened, yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew
1|had perished. And again in imagination she went over her whole
1|conversation with Kuragin, and again saw the face, gestures, and
1|tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Anatole Kuragin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent
1|him away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand
1|rubles a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more,
1|which his creditors demanded from his father.
1|
1|His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for
1|the last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as
1|adjutant to the commander in chief--a post his father had procured for
1|him--and would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to
1|him Princess Mary and Julie Karagina.
1|
1|Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre's
1|house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him
1|after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and
1|gave him money under the guise of loans.
1|
1|As Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had
1|turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that
1|he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French
1|actresses--with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to
1|be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at
1|Danilov's or other Moscow revelers', drank whole nights through,
1|outvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the
1|best society. There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies,
1|and he flirted with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run
1|after the unmarried girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most
1|of them plain. There was a special reason for this, as he had got
1|married two years before--a fact known only to his most intimate
1|friends. At that time while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish
1|landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole
1|had very soon abandoned his wife and, for a payment which he agreed to
1|send to his father-in-law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off
1|as a bachelor.
1|
1|Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with
1|others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
1|impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
1|never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of
1|considering how his actions might affect others or what the
1|consequences of this or that action of his might be. He was
1|convinced that, as a duck is so made that it must live in water, so
1|God had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year
1|and always occupy a prominent position in society. He believed this so
1|firmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of it too and did
1|not refuse him either a leading place in society or money, which he
1|borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay.
1|
1|He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning.
1|He was not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still
1|less could he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed
1|his father by spoiling his own career, and he laughed at
1|distinctions of all kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse
1|anyone who asked of him. All he cared about was gaiety and women,
1|and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in
1|these tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the
1|gratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly
1|considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad
1|people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.
1|
1|Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence
1|similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope
1|of forgiveness. "All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all
1|will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much."
1|
1|Dolokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and
1|his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling,
1|and dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kuragin
1|and made use of him for his own ends.
1|
1|Anatole was sincerely fond of Dolokhov for his cleverness and
1|audacity. Dolokhov, who needed Anatole Kuragin's name, position, and
1|connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set,
1|made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting
1|the other feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole,
1|the very process of dominating another's will was in itself a
1|pleasure, a habit, and a necessity to Dolokhov.
1|
1|Natasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin. At supper after the
1|opera he described to Dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
1|attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his
1|intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was
1|incapable of considering what might come of such love-making, as he
1|never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions.
1|
1|"She's first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us," replied
1|Dolokhov.
1|
1|"I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner," said Anatole. "Eh?"
1|
1|"You'd better wait till she's married...."
1|
1|"You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,"
1|pursued Anatole.
1|
1|"You have been caught once already by a 'little girl,'" said
1|Dolokhov who knew of Kuragin's marriage. "Take care!"
1|
1|"Well, that can't happen twice! Eh?" said Anatole, with a
1|good-humored laugh.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|The day after the opera the Rostovs went nowhere and nobody came
1|to see them. Marya Dmitrievna talked to the count about something
1|which they concealed from Natasha. Natasha guessed they were talking
1|about the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and
1|offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice
1|that day sent a manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he
1|had come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now than during her
1|first days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining for him were now
1|added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess
1|Mary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety of which she did not
1|understand the cause. She continually fancied that either he would
1|never come or that something would happen to her before he came. She
1|could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she
1|had done before. As soon as she began to think of him, the
1|recollection of the old prince, of Princess Mary, of the theater,
1|and of Kuragin mingled with her thoughts. The question again presented
1|itself whether she was not guilty, whether she had not already
1|broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found herself recalling
1|to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and every shade in
1|the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to
1|arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To
1|the family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less
1|tranquil and happy than before.
1|
1|On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to Mass at
1|her parish church--the Church of the Assumption built over the
1|graves of victims of the plague.
1|
1|"I don't like those fashionable churches," she said, evidently
1|priding herself on her independence of thought. "God is the same every
1|where. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently
1|and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is there
1|in giving concerts in the choir? I don't like it, it's just
1|self-indulgence!"
1|
1|Marya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her
1|whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the
1|servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church.
1|At her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had
1|vodka and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was
1|the holiday so noticeable as in Marya Dmitrievna's broad, stern
1|face, which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.
1|
1|After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room
1|where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a
1|servant announced that the carriage was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna
1|rose with a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid
1|calls, and announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas
1|Bolkonski to have an explanation with him about Natasha.
1|
1|After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on
1|the Rostovs, and Natasha, very glad of this diversion, having shut
1|herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself
1|trying on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without
1|sleeves and only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in
1|the glass how the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the
1|animated sounds of her father's voice and another's--a woman's--that
1|made her flush. It was Helene. Natasha had not time to take off the
1|bodice before the door opened and Countess Bezukhova, dressed in a
1|purple velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with
1|good-humored amiable smiles.
1|
1|"Oh, my enchantress!" she cried to the blushing Natasha.
1|"Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count," said
1|she to Count Rostov who had followed her in. "How can you live in
1|Moscow and go nowhere? No, I won't let you off! Mademoiselle George
1|will recite at my house tonight and there'll be some people, and if
1|you don't bring your lovely girls--who are prettier than
1|Mademoiselle George--I won't know you! My husband is away in Tver or I
1|would send him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must!
1|Between eight and nine."
1|
1|She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied
1|respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the
1|looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely.
1|She did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually
1|praising Natasha's beauty. She looked at Natasha's dresses and praised
1|them, as well as a new dress of her own made of "metallic gauze,"
1|which she had received from Paris, and advised Natasha to have one
1|like it.
1|
1|"But anything suits you, my charmer!" she remarked.
1|
1|A smile of pleasure never left Natasha's face. She felt happy and as
1|if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess
1|Bezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and
1|important and was now so kind to her. Natasha brightened up and felt
1|almost in love with this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind.
1|Helene for her part was sincerely delighted with Natasha and wished to
1|give her a good time. Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natasha
1|together, and she was calling on the Rostovs for that purpose. The
1|idea of throwing her brother and Natasha together amused her.
1|
1|Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natasha
1|for drawing Boris away, she did not think of that now, and in her
1|own way heartily wished Natasha well. As she was leaving the Rostovs
1|she called her protegee aside.
1|
1|"My brother dined with me yesterday--we nearly died of laughter--he
1|ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite
1|madly, in love with you, my dear."
1|
1|Natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this.
1|
1|"How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!" said Helene. "You
1|must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a
1|reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your
1|fiance would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to
1|death."
1|
1|"So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre--that
1|good Pierre--have talked and laughed about this. So it's all right."
1|And again, under Helene's influence, what had seemed terrible now
1|seemed simple and natural. "And she is such a grande dame, so kind,
1|and evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?" thought
1|Natasha, gazing at Helene with wide-open, wondering eyes.
1|
1|Marya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having
1|evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince's. She was still too
1|agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly.
1|In answer to the count's inquiries she replied that things were all
1|right and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of
1|Countess Bezukhova's visit and the invitation for that evening,
1|Marya Dmitrievna remarked:
1|
1|"I don't care to have anything to do with Bezukhova and don't advise
1|you to; however, if you've promised--go. It will divert your
1|thoughts," she added, addressing Natasha.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|Count Rostov took the girls to Countess Bezukhova's. There were a
1|good many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natasha. Count
1|Rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost
1|entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct.
1|Mademoiselle George was standing in a corner of the drawing room
1|surrounded by young men. There were several Frenchmen present, among
1|them Metivier who from the time Helene reached Moscow had been an
1|intimate in her house. The count decided not to sit down to cards or
1|let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle
1|George's performance was over.
1|
1|Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rostovs.
1|Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha and
1|followed her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same
1|feeling she had had at the opera--gratified vanity at his admiration
1|of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them.
1|
1|Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of
1|her beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George
1|went out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people
1|began arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a
1|chair for Natasha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count,
1|who never lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down
1|behind her.
1|
1|Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red
1|shawl draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for
1|her, and assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was
1|audible.
1|
1|Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience
1|and began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for
1|her son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,
1|lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
1|sounds, rolling her eyes.
1|
1|"Adorable! divine! delicious!" was heard from every side.
1|
1|Natasha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor
1|understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself
1|again completely borne away into this strange senseless world--so
1|remote from her old world--a world in which it was impossible to know
1|what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,
1|and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
1|expectancy.
1|
1|After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
1|Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.
1|
1|"How beautiful she is!" Natasha remarked to her father who had
1|also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.
1|
1|"I don't think so when I look at you!" said Anatole, following
1|Natasha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him.
1|"You are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never
1|ceased..."
1|
1|"Come, come, Natasha!" said the count, as he turned back for his
1|daughter. "How beautiful she is!" Natasha without saying anything
1|stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
1|eyes.
1|
1|After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and
1|Countess Bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.
1|
1|The count wished to go home, but Helene entreated him not to spoil
1|her improvised ball, and the Rostovs stayed on. Anatole asked
1|Natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand
1|and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the
1|ecossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when
1|they happened to be by themselves, but merely gazed at her. Natasha
1|lifted her frightened eyes to him, but there was such confident
1|tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not,
1|whilst looking at him, say what she had to say. She lowered her eyes.
1|
1|"Don't say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,"
1|she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.
1|
1|Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.
1|
1|"Don't speak to me of that! What can I do?" said he. "I tell you I
1|am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are
1|enchanting?... It's our turn to begin."
1|
1|Natasha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open
1|frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly
1|anything that went on that evening. They danced the ecossaise and
1|the Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to
1|remain. Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt
1|his eyes upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her
1|father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that
1|Helene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother's love,
1|and that she again met Anatole in the little sitting room. Helene
1|had disappeared leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and
1|said in a tender voice:
1|
1|"I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never
1|see you? I love you madly. Can I never...?" and, blocking her path, he
1|brought his face close to hers.
1|
1|His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she
1|saw nothing but them.
1|
1|"Natalie?" he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
1|painfully pressed. "Natalie?"
1|
1|"I don't understand. I have nothing to say," her eyes replied.
1|
1|Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she
1|felt herself released, and Helene's footsteps and the rustle of her
1|dress were heard in the room. Natasha looked round at her, and then,
1|red and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and
1|moved toward the door.
1|
1|"One word, just one, for God's sake!" cried Anatole.
1|
1|She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to
1|her what had happened and to which she could find no answer.
1|
1|"Natalie, just a word, only one!" he kept repeating, evidently not
1|knowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene came up to them.
1|
1|Helene returned with Natasha to the drawing room. The Rostovs went
1|away without staying for supper.
1|
1|After reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night. She was
1|tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or
1|Prince Andrew. She loved Prince Andrew--she remembered distinctly
1|how deeply she loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there
1|was no doubt. "Else how could all this have happened?" thought she.
1|"If, after that, I could return his smile when saying good-by, if I
1|was able to let it come to that, it means that I loved him from the
1|first. It means that he is kind, noble, and splendid, and I could
1|not help loving him. What am I to do if I love him and the other one
1|too?" she asked herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible
1|questions.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began to
1|move about and talk, dressmakers came again. Marya Dmitrievna
1|appeared, and they were called to breakfast. Natasha kept looking
1|uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to
1|intercept every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the
1|same as usual.
1|
1|After breakfast, which was her best time, Marya Dmitrievna sat
1|down in her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her.
1|
1|"Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is
1|my advice," she began. "Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince
1|Bolkonski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to
1|begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had
1|to say!"
1|
1|"Well, and he?" asked the count.
1|
1|"He? He's crazy... he did not want to listen. But what's the use
1|of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out," said Marya
1|Dmitrievna. "My advice to you is finish your business and go back home
1|to Otradnoe... and wait there."
1|
1|"Oh, no!" exclaimed Natasha.
1|
1|"Yes, go back," said Marya Dmitrievna, "and wait there. If your
1|betrothed comes here now--there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but
1|alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to
1|you."
1|
1|Count Rostov approved of this suggestion, appreciating its
1|reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better
1|to visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the
1|wedding, against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otradnoe.
1|
1|"That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took
1|her," said the old count.
1|
1|"No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But
1|if he won't--that's his affair," said Marya Dmitrievna, looking for
1|something in her reticule. "Besides, the trousseau is ready, so
1|there is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I'll send after
1|you. Though I don't like letting you go, it is the best way. So go,
1|with God's blessing!"
1|
1|Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed
1|it to Natasha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.
1|
1|"She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She's
1|afraid you might think that she does not like you."
1|
1|"But she doesn't like me," said Natasha.
1|
1|"Don't talk nonsense!" cried Marya Dmitrievna.
1|
1|"I shan't believe anyone, I know she doesn't like me," replied
1|Natasha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold
1|and angry resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her
1|more intently and to frown.
1|
1|"Don't answer like that, my good girl!" she said. "What I say is
1|true! Write an answer!" Natasha did not reply and went to her own room
1|to read Princess Mary's letter.
1|
1|Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the
1|misunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father's
1|feelings might be, she begged Natasha to believe that she could not
1|help loving her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose
1|happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything.
1|
1|"Do not think, however," she wrote, "that my father is
1|ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be
1|forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes
1|his son happy." Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time
1|when she could see her again.
1|
1|After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to
1|answer it. "Dear Princess," she wrote in French quickly and
1|mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all
1|that had happened the evening before? "Yes, yes! All that has
1|happened, and now all is changed," she thought as she sat with the
1|letter she had begun before her. "Must I break off with him? Must I
1|really? That's awful..." and to escape from these dreadful thoughts
1|she went to Sonya and began sorting patterns with her.
1|
1|After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess
1|Mary's letter. "Can it be that it is all over?" she thought. "Can it
1|be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that
1|went before?" She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its
1|former strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin. She
1|vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew's wife, and the scenes of
1|happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and
1|at the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of
1|yesterday's interview with Anatole.
1|
1|"Why could that not be as well?" she sometimes asked herself in
1|complete bewilderment. "Only so could I be completely happy; but now I
1|have to choose, and I can't be happy without either of them. Only,"
1|she thought, "to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it
1|from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is
1|spoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew's
1|love, in which I have lived so long?"
1|
1|"Please, Miss!" whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
1|air. "A man told me to give you this-" and she handed Natasha a
1|letter.
1|
1|"Only, for Christ's sake..." the girl went on, as Natasha, without
1|thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
1|Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only
1|that it was a letter from him--from the man she loved. Yes, she
1|loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened?
1|And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand?
1|
1|With trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter
1|which Dolokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she
1|found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.
1|
1|"Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you
1|or to die. There is no other way for me," the letter began. Then he
1|went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him--for
1|this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her--but that
1|if she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power
1|could hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her
1|away and carry her off to the ends of the earth.
1|
1|"Yes, yes! I love him!" thought Natasha, reading the letter for
1|the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each
1|word of it.
1|
1|That evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs' and
1|proposed to take the girls with her. Natasha, pleading a headache,
1|remained at home.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|On returning late in the evening Sonya went to Natasha's room, and
1|to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open
1|on the table, beside her lay Anatole's letter. Sonya picked it up
1|and read it.
1|
1|As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natasha, trying to find in
1|her face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find
1|it. Her face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep
1|herself from choking, Sonya, pale and trembling with fear and
1|agitation, sat down in an armchair and burst into tears.
1|
1|"How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she
1|have left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kuragin go
1|to such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that's plain! What
1|will Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is
1|the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before
1|yesterday, yesterday, and today," thought Sonya. "But it can't be that
1|she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who it
1|was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a
1|thing!"
1|
1|Sonya wiped away her tears and went up to Natasha, again scanning
1|her face.
1|
1|"Natasha!" she said, just audibly.
1|
1|Natasha awoke and saw Sonya.
1|
1|"Ah, you're back?"
1|
1|And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment
1|of awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sonya's look of
1|embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.
1|
1|"Sonya, you've read that letter?" she demanded.
1|
1|"Yes," answered Sonya softly.
1|
1|Natasha smiled rapturously.
1|
1|"No, Sonya, I can't any longer!" she said. "I can't hide it from you
1|any longer. You know, we love one another! Sonya, darling, he
1|writes... Sonya..."
1|
1|Sonya stared open-eyed at Natasha, unable to believe her ears.
1|
1|"And Bolkonski?" she asked.
1|
1|"Ah, Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!" cried Natasha. "You
1|don't know what love is...."
1|
1|"But, Natasha, can that be all over?"
1|
1|Natasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not
1|grasp the question.
1|
1|"Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?" said Sonya.
1|
1|"Oh, you don't understand anything! Don't talk nonsense, just
1|listen!" said Natasha, with momentary vexation.
1|
1|"But I can't believe it," insisted Sonya. "I don't understand. How
1|is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you
1|have only seen him three times! Natasha, I don't believe you, you're
1|joking! In three days to forget everything and so..."
1|
1|"Three days?" said Natasha. "It seems to me I've loved him a hundred
1|years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can't
1|understand it.... Sonya, wait a bit, sit here," and Natasha embraced
1|and kissed her.
1|
1|"I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it
1|too, but it's only now that I feel such love. It's not the same as
1|before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his
1|slave, and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave!
1|Whatever he orders I shall do. You don't understand that. What can I
1|do? What can I do, Sonya?" cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened
1|expression.
1|
1|"But think what you are doing," cried Sonya. "I can't leave it
1|like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so
1|far?" she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.
1|
1|"I told you that I have no will," Natasha replied. "Why can't you
1|understand? I love him!"
1|
1|"Then I won't let it come to that... I shall tell!" cried Sonya,
1|bursting into tears.
1|
1|"What do you mean? For God's sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!"
1|declared Natasha. "You want me to be miserable, you want us to be
1|separated...."
1|
1|When she saw Natasha's fright, Sonya shed tears of shame and pity
1|for her friend.
1|
1|"But what has happened between you?" she asked. "What has he said to
1|you? Why doesn't he come to the house?"
1|
1|Natasha did not answer her questions.
1|
1|"For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me,"
1|Natasha entreated. "Remember no one ought to interfere in such
1|matters! I have confided in you...."
1|
1|"But why this secrecy? Why doesn't he come to the house?" asked
1|Sonya. "Why doesn't he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince
1|Andrew gave you complete freedom--if it is really so; but I don't
1|believe it! Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can
1|be?"
1|
1|Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment. Evidently this question
1|presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know
1|how to answer it.
1|
1|"I don't know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!"
1|
1|Sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously.
1|
1|"If there were reasons..." she began.
1|
1|But Natasha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.
1|
1|"Sonya, one can't doubt him! One can't, one can't! Don't you
1|understand?" she cried.
1|
1|"Does he love you?"
1|
1|"Does he love me?" Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her
1|friend's lack of comprehension. "Why, you have read his letter and you
1|have seen him."
1|
1|"But if he is dishonorable?"
1|
1|"He! dishonorable? If you only knew!" exclaimed Natasha.
1|
1|"If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions
1|or cease seeing you; and if you won't do this, I will. I will write to
1|him, and I will tell Papa!" said Sonya resolutely.
1|
1|"But I can't live without him!" cried Natasha.
1|
1|"Natasha, I don't understand you. And what are you saying! Think
1|of your father and of Nicholas."
1|
1|"I don't want anyone, I don't love anyone but him. How dare you
1|say he is dishonorable? Don't you know that I love him?" screamed
1|Natasha. "Go away, Sonya! I don't want to quarrel with you, but go,
1|for God's sake go! You see how I am suffering!" Natasha cried angrily,
1|in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. Sonya burst into
1|sobs and ran from the room.
1|
1|Natasha went to the table and without a moment's reflection wrote
1|that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
1|the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their
1|misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the
1|magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
1|freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her
1|if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife.
1|At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Natasha.
1|
1|
1|On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country, but on
1|Wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his
1|estate near Moscow.
1|
1|On the day the count left, Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big
1|dinner party at the Karagins', and Marya Dmitrievna took them there.
1|At that party Natasha again met Anatole, and Sonya noticed that she
1|spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through
1|dinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home Natasha was
1|the first to begin the explanation Sonya expected.
1|
1|"There, Sonya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,"
1|Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to
1|be praised. "We have had an explanation today."
1|
1|"Well, what happened? What did he say? Natasha, how glad I am you're
1|not angry with me! Tell me everything--the whole truth. What did he
1|say?"
1|
1|Natasha became thoughtful.
1|
1|"Oh, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I
1|had promised Bolkonski. He was glad I was free to refuse him."
1|
1|Sonya sighed sorrowfully.
1|
1|"But you haven't refused Bolkonski?" said she.
1|
1|"Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski. Why
1|do you think so badly of me?"
1|
1|"I don't think anything, only I don't understand this..."
1|
1|"Wait a bit, Sonya, you'll understand everything. You'll see what
1|a man he is! Now don't think badly of me or of him. I don't think
1|badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?"
1|
1|Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her.
1|The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha's face
1|became, the more serious and stern grew Sonya's.
1|
1|"Natasha," said she, "you asked me not to speak to you, and I
1|haven't spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don't trust him,
1|Natasha. Why this secrecy?"
1|
1|"Again, again!" interrupted Natasha.
1|
1|"Natasha, I am afraid for you!"
1|
1|"Afraid of what?"
1|
1|"I am afraid you're going to your ruin," said Sonya resolutely,
1|and was herself horrified at what she had said.
1|
1|Anger again showed in Natasha's face.
1|
1|"And I'll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It's not
1|your business! It won't be you, but I, who'll suffer. Leave me
1|alone, leave me alone! I hate you!"
1|
1|"Natasha!" moaned Sonya, aghast.
1|
1|"I hate you, I hate you! You're my enemy forever!" And Natasha ran
1|out of the room.
1|
1|Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her. With the
1|same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the
1|house, taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once
1|abandoning them.
1|
1|Hard as it was for Sonya, she watched her friend and did not let her
1|out of her sight.
1|
1|The day before the count was to return, Sonya noticed that Natasha
1|sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting
1|something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past,
1|whom Sonya took to be Anatole.
1|
1|Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed
1|that at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and
1|unnatural state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she
1|did not finish, and laughed at everything.
1|
1|After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha's door timidly
1|waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at
1|the door learned that another letter had been delivered.
1|
1|Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some
1|dreadful plan for that evening. Sonya knocked at her door. Natasha did
1|not let her in.
1|
1|"She will run away with him!" thought Sonya. "She is capable of
1|anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in
1|her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle," Sonya
1|remembered. "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what
1|am I to do?" thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly
1|indicated that Natasha had some terrible intention. "The count is
1|away. What am I to do? Write to Kuragin demanding an explanation?
1|But what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince
1|Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she
1|really has already refused Bolkonski--she sent a letter to Princess
1|Mary yesterday. And Uncle is away...." To tell Marya Dmitrievna who
1|had such faith in Natasha seemed to Sonya terrible. "Well, anyway,"
1|thought Sonya as she stood in the dark passage, "now or never I must
1|prove that I remember the family's goodness to me and that I love
1|Nicholas. Yes! If I don't sleep for three nights I'll not leave this
1|passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the
1|family be disgraced," thought she.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Anatole had lately moved to Dolokhov's. The plan for Natalie
1|Rostova's abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by
1|Dolokhov a few days before, and on the day that Sonya, after listening
1|at Natasha's door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been
1|put into execution. Natasha had promised to come out to Kuragin at the
1|back porch at ten that evening. Kuragin was to put her into a troyka
1|he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of
1|Kamenka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a
1|marriage ceremony over them. At Kamenka a relay of horses was to
1|wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they
1|would hasten abroad with post horses.
1|
1|Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand
1|rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand
1|borrowed with Dolokhov's help.
1|
1|Two witnesses for the mock marriage--Khvostikov, a retired petty
1|official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and
1|Makarin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an
1|unbounded affection for Kuragin--were sitting at tea in Dolokhov's
1|front room.
1|
1|In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
1|Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dolokhov in a traveling
1|cloak and high boots, at an open desk on which lay abacus and some
1|bundles of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to
1|and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the
1|study to the room behind, where his French valet and others were
1|packing the last of his things. Dolokhov was counting the money and
1|noting something down.
1|
1|"Well," he said, "Khvostikov must have two thousand."
1|
1|"Give it to him, then," said Anatole.
1|
1|"Makarka" (their name for Makarin) "will go through fire and water
1|for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled," said
1|Dolokhov, showing him the memorandum. "Is that right?"
1|
1|"Yes, of course," returned Anatole, evidently not listening to
1|Dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not
1|leave his face.
1|
1|Dolokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an
1|ironic smile:
1|
1|"Do you know? You'd really better drop it all. There's still time!"
1|
1|"Fool," retorted Anatole. "Don't talk nonsense! If you only
1|knew... it's the devil knows what!"
1|
1|"No, really, give it up!" said Dolokhov. "I am speaking seriously.
1|It's no joke, this plot you've hatched."
1|
1|"What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?" said Anatole, making a
1|grimace. "Really it's no time for your stupid jokes," and he left
1|the room.
1|
1|Dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole
1|had gone out.
1|
1|"You wait a bit," he called after him. "I'm not joking, I'm
1|talking sense. Come here, come here!"
1|
1|Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov, trying to give him his
1|attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.
1|
1|"Now listen to me. I'm telling you this for the last time. Why
1|should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything
1|for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the
1|money? I did it all."
1|
1|"Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?" And
1|Anatole sighed and embraced Dolokhov.
1|
1|"I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a
1|dangerous business, and if you think about it--a stupid business.
1|Well, you'll carry her off--all right! Will they let it stop at
1|that? It will come out that you're already married. Why, they'll
1|have you in the criminal court...."
1|
1|"Oh, nonsense, nonsense!" Anatole ejaculated and again made a
1|grimace. "Didn't I explain to you? What?" And Anatole, with the
1|partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have
1|reached by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already
1|put to Dolokhov a hundred times. "Didn't I explain to you that I
1|have come to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid," he went
1|on, crooking one finger, "then I have nothing to answer for; but if it
1|is valid, no matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it.
1|Isn't that so? And don't talk to me, don't, don't."
1|
1|"Seriously, you'd better drop it! You'll only get yourself into a
1|mess!"
1|
1|"Go to the devil!" cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the
1|room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of
1|Dolokhov with his feet turned under him. "It's the very devil! What?
1|Feel how it beats!" He took Dolokhov's hand and put it on his heart.
1|"What a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!" he added in
1|French. "What?"
1|
1|Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
1|looked at him--evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of
1|him.
1|
1|"Well and when the money's gone, what then?"
1|
1|"What then? Eh?" repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a
1|thought of the future. "What then?... Then, I don't know.... But why
1|talk nonsense!" He glanced at his watch. "It's time!"
1|
1|Anatole went into the back room.
1|
1|"Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!" he shouted to the
1|servants.
1|
1|Dolokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to
1|bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went
1|into the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting.
1|
1|Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and
1|smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to
1|himself.
1|
1|"Come and eat something. Have a drink!" Dolokhov shouted to him from
1|the other room.
1|
1|"I don't want to," answered Anatole continuing to smile.
1|
1|"Come! Balaga is here."
1|
1|Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balaga was a famous
1|troyka driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and
1|had given them good service with his troykas. More than once when
1|Anatole's regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in
1|the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back
1|again the next night. More than once he had enabled Dolokhov to escape
1|when pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town
1|with gypsies and "ladykins" as he called the cocottes. More than
1|once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles
1|in the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the
1|consequences by "my gentlemen" as he called them. He had ruined more
1|than one horse in their service. More than once they had beaten him,
1|and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira,
1|which he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of them
1|which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They
1|often called Balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance
1|at the gypsies', and more than one thousand rubles of their money
1|had passed through his hands. In their service he risked his skin
1|and his life twenty times a year, and in their service had lost more
1|horses than the money he had from them would buy. But he liked them;
1|liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a
1|driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full gallop through
1|the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind
1|him: "Get on! Get on!" when it was impossible to go any faster. He
1|liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead
1|than alive, was already hurrying out of his way. "Real gentlemen!"
1|he considered them.
1|
1|Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and
1|because he liked the things they liked. With others Balaga
1|bargained, charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours' drive, and
1|rarely drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But
1|with "his gentlemen" he always drove himself and never demanded
1|anything for his work. Only a couple of times a year--when he knew
1|from their valets that they had money in hand--he would turn up of a
1|morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him.
1|The gentlemen always made him sit down.
1|
1|"Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir," or "your excellency," he
1|would say. "I am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to go
1|to the fair."
1|
1|And Anatole and Dolokhov, when they had money, would give him a
1|thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.
1|
1|Balaga was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about
1|twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck,
1|glittering little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine,
1|dark-blue, silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin.
1|
1|On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the
1|front corner of the room, and went up to Dolokhov, holding out a
1|small, black hand.
1|
1|"Theodore Ivanych!" he said, bowing.
1|
1|"How d'you do, friend? Well, here he is!"
1|
1|"Good day, your excellency!" he said, again holding out his hand
1|to Anatole who had just come in.
1|
1|"I say, Balaga," said Anatole, putting his hands on the man's
1|shoulders, "do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....
1|What horses have you come with? Eh?"
1|
1|"As your messenger ordered, your special beasts," replied Balaga.
1|
1|"Well, listen, Balaga! Drive all three to death but get me there
1|in three hours. Eh?"
1|
1|"When they are dead, what shall I drive?" said Balaga with a wink.
1|
1|"Mind, I'll smash your face in! Don't make jokes!" cried Anatole,
1|suddenly rolling his eyes.
1|
1|"Why joke?" said the driver, laughing. "As if I'd grudge my
1|gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast
1|we'll go!"
1|
1|"Ah!" said Anatole. "Well, sit down."
1|
1|"Yes, sit down!" said Dolokhov.
1|
1|"I'll stand, Theodore Ivanych."
1|
1|"Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!" said Anatole, and filled a large
1|glass of Madeira for him.
1|
1|The driver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After
1|refusing it for manners' sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with
1|a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap.
1|
1|"And when are we to start, your excellency?"
1|
1|"Well..." Anatole looked at his watch. "We'll start at once. Mind,
1|Balaga! You'll get there in time? Eh?"
1|
1|"That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn't we be
1|there in time?" replied Balaga. "Didn't we get you to Tver in seven
1|hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?"
1|
1|"Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver," said Anatole,
1|smilingly at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed
1|rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. "Will you believe it, Makarka,
1|it took one's breath away, the rate we flew. We came across a train of
1|loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?"
1|
1|"Those were horses!" Balaga continued the tale. "That time I'd
1|harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts," he went
1|on, turning to Dolokhov. "Will you believe it, Theodore Ivanych, those
1|animals flew forty miles? I couldn't hold them in, my hands grew
1|numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins--'Catch hold
1|yourself, your excellency!' says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom
1|of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn't a case of urging them
1|on, there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils
1|took us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it."
1|

1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later
1|wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily
1|set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having
1|looked in a mirror, and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he
1|had assumed before it, he lifted a glass of wine.
1|
1|"Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!"
1|said Anatole. "Well, comrades and friends..." he considered for a
1|moment "...of my youth, farewell!" he said, turning to Makarin and the
1|others.
1|
1|Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to
1|make something touching and solemn out of this address to his
1|comrades. He spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest
1|slightly swayed one leg.
1|
1|"All take glasses; you too, Balaga. Well, comrades and friends of my
1|youth, we've had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when
1|shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time--now
1|farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!..." he cried, and emptying
1|his glass flung it on the floor.
1|
1|"To your health!" said Balaga who also emptied his glass, and
1|wiped his mouth with his handkerchief.
1|
1|Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.
1|
1|"Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!
1|
1|"Let's go. Let's go!" cried Anatole.
1|
1|Balaga was about to leave the room.
1|
1|"No, stop!" said Anatole. "Shut the door; we have first to sit down.
1|That's the way."
1|
1|They shut the door and all sat down.
1|
1|"Now, quick march, lads!" said Anatole, rising.
1|
1|Joseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all
1|went out into the vestibule.
1|
1|"And where's the fur cloak?" asked Dolokhov. "Hey, Ignatka! Go to
1|Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what
1|elopements are like," continued Dolokhov with a wink. "Why, she'll
1|rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if
1|you delay at all there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mamma,' and she's
1|frozen in a minute and must go back--but you wrap the fur cloak
1|round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh."
1|
1|The valet brought a woman's fox-lined cloak.
1|
1|"Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrena, the sable!" he
1|shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms.
1|
1|A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black
1|eyes and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a
1|sable mantle on her arm.
1|
1|"Here, I don't grudge it--take it!" she said, evidently afraid of
1|her master and yet regretful of her cloak.
1|
1|Dolokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over
1|Matrena, and wrapped her up in it.
1|
1|"That's the way," said Dolokhov, "and then so!" and he turned the
1|collar up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered.
1|"And then so, do you see?" and he pushed Anatole's head forward to
1|meet the gap left by the collar, through which Matrena's brilliant
1|smile was seen.
1|
1|"Well, good-by, Matrena," said Anatole, kissing her. "Ah, my
1|revels here are over. Remember me to Steshka. There, good-by! Good-by,
1|Matrena, wish me luck!"
1|
1|"Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!" said Matrena in her
1|gypsy accent.
1|
1|Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers
1|were holding the horses. Balaga took his seat in the front one and
1|holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and
1|Dolokhov got in with him. Makarin, Khvostikov, and a valet seated
1|themselves in the other sleigh.
1|
1|"Well, are you ready?" asked Balaga.
1|
1|"Go!" he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka
1|tore down the Nikitski Boulevard.
1|
1|"Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!..." The shouting of Balaga
1|and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be
1|heard. On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage;
1|something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the
1|Arbat Street.
1|
1|After taking a turn along the Podnovinski Boulevard, Balaga began to
1|rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old
1|Konyusheny Street.
1|
1|The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and
1|Anatole and Dolokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the
1|gate Dolokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant
1|ran out.
1|
1|"Come into the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out
1|directly," said she.
1|
1|Dolokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the
1|courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.
1|
1|He was met by Gabriel, Marya Dmitrievna's gigantic footman.
1|
1|"Come to the mistress, please," said the footman in his deep bass,
1|intercepting any retreat.
1|
1|"To what Mistress? Who are you?" asked Anatole in a breathless
1|whisper.
1|
1|"Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in."
1|
1|"Kuragin! Come back!" shouted Dolokhov. "Betrayed! Back!"
1|
1|Dolokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and
1|was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With
1|a last desperate effort Dolokhov pushed the porter aside, and when
1|Anatole ran back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket,
1|and ran back with him to the troyka.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|Marya Dmitrievna, having found Sonya weeping in the corridor, made
1|her confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natasha she
1|read it and went into Natasha's room with it in her hand.
1|
1|"You shameless good-for-nothing!" said she. "I won't hear a word."
1|
1|Pushing back Natasha who looked at her with astonished but
1|tearless eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the
1|yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but
1|not to let them out again, and having told the footman to bring them
1|up to her, she seated herself in the drawing room to await the
1|abductors.
1|
1|When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run
1|away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced
1|through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward
1|midnight she went to Natasha's room fingering the key in her pocket.
1|Sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. "Marya Dmitrievna, for
1|God's sake let me in to her!" she pleaded, but Marya Dmitrievna
1|unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer....
1|"Disgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I'm only
1|sorry for her father!" thought she, trying to restrain her wrath.
1|"Hard as it may be, I'll tell them all to hold their tongues and
1|will hide it from the count." She entered the room with resolute
1|steps. Natasha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and
1|she did not stir. She was in just the same position in which Marya
1|Dmitrievna had left her.
1|
1|"A nice girl! Very nice!" said Marya Dmitrievna. "Arranging meetings
1|with lovers in my house! It's no use pretending: you listen when I
1|speak to you!" And Marya Dmitrievna touched her arm. "Listen when I
1|speak! You've disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I'd treat
1|you differently, but I'm sorry for your father, so I will conceal it."
1|
1|Natasha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved
1|with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Marya Dmitrievna
1|glanced round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha.
1|
1|"It's lucky for him that he escaped me; but I'll find him!" she said
1|in her rough voice. "Do you hear what I am saying or not?" she added.
1|
1|She put her large hand under Natasha's face and turned it toward
1|her. Both Marya Dmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they saw how
1|Natasha looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed,
1|her cheeks sunken.
1|
1|"Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!" she muttered,
1|wrenching herself from Marya Dmitrievna's hands with a vicious
1|effort and sinking down again into her former position.
1|
1|"Natalie!" said Marya Dmitrievna. "I wish for your good. Lie
1|still, stay like that then, I won't touch you. But listen. I won't
1|tell you how guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your
1|father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?"
1|
1|Again Natasha's body shook with sobs.
1|
1|"Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?"
1|
1|"I have no betrothed: I have refused him!" cried Natasha.
1|
1|"That's all the same," continued Marya Dmitrievna. "If they hear of
1|this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he
1|challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?"
1|
1|"Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who
1|asked you to?" shouted Natasha, raising herself on the sofa and
1|looking malignantly at Marya Dmitrievna.
1|
1|"But what did you want?" cried Marya Dmitrievna, growing angry
1|again. "Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to
1|the house? Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing
1|girl?... Well, if he had carried you off... do you think they wouldn't
1|have found him? Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he's a
1|scoundrel, a wretch--that's a fact!"
1|
1|"He is better than any of you!" exclaimed Natasha getting up. "If
1|you hadn't interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it?
1|Sonya, why?... Go away!"
1|
1|And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which
1|people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned.
1|Marya Dmitrievna was to speak again but Natasha cried out:
1|
1|"Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!" and she threw
1|herself back on the sofa.
1|
1|Marya Dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on
1|her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that
1|nobody would know anything about it if only Natasha herself would
1|undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had
1|happened. Natasha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she
1|grew cold and had a shivering fit. Marya Dmitrievna put a pillow under
1|her head, covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some
1|lime-flower water, but Natasha did not respond to her.
1|
1|"Well, let her sleep," said Marya Dmitrievna as she went out of the
1|room supposing Natasha to be asleep.
1|
1|But Natasha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open
1|eyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not
1|sleep or weep and did not speak to Sonya who got up and went to her
1|several times.
1|
1|Next day Count Rostov returned from his estate near Moscow in time
1|for lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the
1|affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was
1|nothing to keep him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess
1|whom he missed. Marya Dmitrievna met him and told him that Natasha had
1|been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor,
1|but that she was better now. Natasha had not left her room that
1|morning. With compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she
1|sat at the window, uneasily watching the people who drove past and
1|hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room. She was
1|evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would
1|write to her.
1|
1|When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the
1|sound of a man's footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and
1|malevolent expression. She did not even get up to greet him. "What
1|is the matter with you, my angel? Are you ill?" asked the count.
1|
1|After a moment's silence Natasha answered: "Yes, ill."
1|
1|In reply to the count's anxious inquiries as to why she was so
1|dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she
1|assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry.
1|Marya Dmitrievna confirmed Natasha's assurances that nothing had
1|happened. From the pretense of illness, from his daughter's
1|distress, and by the embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya
1|Dmitrievna, the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during
1|his absence, but it was so terrible for him to think that anything
1|disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter, and he so prized his
1|own cheerful tranquillity, that he avoided inquiries and tried to
1|assure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and he was only
1|dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the
1|country.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to
1|go away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rostovs
1|came to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him hasten to
1|carry out his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexeevich's
1|widow, who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers
1|of her deceased husband's.
1|
1|When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya
1|Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
1|importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed. Pierre
1|had been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling
1|for her was stronger than a married man's should be for his friend's
1|fiancee. Yet some fate constantly threw them together.
1|
1|"What can have happened? And what can they want with me?" thought he
1|as he dressed to go to Marya Dmitrievna's. "If only Prince Andrew
1|would hurry up and come and marry her!" thought he on his way to the
1|house.
1|
1|On the Tverskoy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.
1|
1|"Pierre! Been back long?" someone shouted. Pierre raised his head.
1|In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering
1|the dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makarin
1|dashed past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of
1|military dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver
1|collar and his head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his
1|white-plumed hat, tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded
1|hair besprinkled with powdery snow.
1|
1|"Yes, indeed, that's a true sage," thought Pierre. "He sees
1|nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so
1|he is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn't I give
1|to be like him!" he thought enviously.
1|
1|In Marya Dmitrievna's anteroom the footman who helped him off with
1|his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.
1|
1|When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natasha sitting at the
1|window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at
1|him, frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.
1|
1|"What has happened?" asked Pierre, entering Marya Dmitrievna's room.
1|
1|"Fine doings!" answered Dmitrievna. "For fifty-eight years have I
1|lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!"
1|
1|And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,
1|Marya Dmitrievna informed him that Natasha had refused Prince Andrew
1|without her parents' knowledge and that the cause of this was
1|Anatole Kuragin into whose society Pierre's wife had thrown her and
1|with whom Natasha had tried to elope during her father's absence, in
1|order to be married secretly.
1|
1|Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was
1|told him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince
1|Andrew's deeply loved affianced wife--the same Natasha Rostova who
1|used to be so charming--should give up Bolkonski for that fool Anatole
1|who was already secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in
1|love with him as to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre
1|could not conceive and could not imagine.
1|
1|He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natasha,
1|whom he had known from a child, with this new conception of her
1|baseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. "They are all
1|alike!" he said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man
1|unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied
1|Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded
1|pride, and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with
1|contempt and even with disgust of that Natasha who had just passed him
1|in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that
1|Natasha's soul was overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation,
1|and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an
1|expression of calm dignity and severity.
1|
1|"But how get married?" said Pierre, in answer to Marya Dmitrievna.
1|"He could not marry--he is married!"
1|
1|"Things get worse from hour to hour!" ejaculated Marya Dmitrievna.
1|"A nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she's expecting him--expecting
1|him since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won't go on
1|expecting him."
1|
1|After hearing the details of Anatole's marriage from Pierre, and
1|giving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Marya
1|Dmitrievna told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that
1|the count or Bolkonski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew
1|of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge
1|Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his
1|brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set
1|eyes on him again. Pierre--only now realizing the danger to the old
1|count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew--promised to do as she wished.
1|Having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him, she let him go
1|to the drawing room.
1|
1|"Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing
1|either," she said. "And I will go and tell her it is no use
1|expecting him! And stay to dinner if you care to!" she called after
1|Pierre.
1|
1|Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning
1|Natasha had told him that she had rejected Bolkonski.
1|
1|"Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!" he said to Pierre. "What
1|troubles one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret
1|having come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she
1|has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody? It's true
1|this engagement never was much to my liking. Of course he is an
1|excellent man, but still, with his father's disapproval they
1|wouldn't have been happy, and Natasha won't lack suitors. Still, it
1|has been going on so long, and to take such a step without father's or
1|mother's consent! And now she's ill, and God knows what! It's hard,
1|Count, hard to manage daughters in their mother's absence...."
1|
1|Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
1|subject, but the count returned to his troubles.
1|
1|Sonya entered the room with an agitated face.
1|
1|"Natasha is not quite well; she's in her room and would like to
1|see you. Marya Dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come."
1|
1|"Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkonski's, no doubt she wants to
1|send him a message," said the count. "Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it
1|all was!"
1|
1|And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
1|room.
1|
1|When Marya Dmitrievna told Natasha that Anatole was married, Natasha
1|did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by
1|Pierre himself. Sonya told Pierre this as she led him along the
1|corridor to Natasha's room.
1|
1|Natasha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Marya Dmitrievna, and
1|her eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look
1|the moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed
1|fixedly at him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or
1|like the others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he
1|evidently did not exist for her.
1|
1|"He knows all about it," said Marya Dmitrievna pointing to Pierre
1|and addressing Natasha. "Let him tell you whether I have told the
1|truth."
1|
1|Natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded
1|animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.
1|
1|"Natalya Ilynichna," Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a
1|feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do,
1|"whether it is true or not should make no difference to you,
1|because..."
1|
1|"Then it is not true that he's married!"
1|
1|"Yes, it is true."
1|
1|"Has he been married long?" she asked. "On your honor?..."
1|
1|Pierre gave his word of honor.
1|
1|"Is he still here?" she asked, quickly.
1|
1|"Yes, I have just seen him."
1|
1|She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands
1|that they should leave her alone.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at
1|once. He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kuragin, at the
1|thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a
1|difficulty in breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the
1|gypsies', nor at Komoneno's. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all
1|was going on as usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were
1|sitting about in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town
1|news. The footman having greeted him, knowing his habits and his
1|acquaintances, told him there was a place left for him in the small
1|dining room and that Prince Michael Zakharych was in the library,
1|but Paul Timofeevich had not yet arrived. One of Pierre's
1|acquaintances, while they were talking about the weather, asked if
1|he had heard of Kuragin's abduction of Rostova which was talked of
1|in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it was
1|nonsense for he had just come from the Rostovs'. He asked everyone
1|about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and another
1|that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this calm,
1|indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
1|soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come,
1|and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove
1|home.
1|
1|Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with
1|Dolokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate
1|affair. It seemed to him essential to see Natasha. In the evening he
1|drove to his sister's to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting.
1|When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his
1|valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The
1|countess' drawing room was full of guests.
1|
1|Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
1|return--at that moment she was more repulsive to him than
1|ever--entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.
1|
1|"Ah, Pierre," said the countess going up to her husband. "You
1|don't know what a plight our Anatole..."
1|
1|She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband's head,
1|in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of
1|that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced
1|after his duel with Dolokhov.
1|
1|"Where you are, there is vice and evil!" said Pierre to his wife.
1|"Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you," he added in French.
1|
1|Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready
1|to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward
1|himself and was leading him from the room.
1|
1|"If you allow yourself in my drawing room..." whispered Helene,
1|but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.
1|
1|Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face
1|betrayed anxiety.
1|
1|Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed
1|Anatole without looking at him.
1|
1|"You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to
1|elope with her, is that so?"
1|
1|"Mon cher," answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in
1|French), "I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to
1|me in that tone."
1|
1|Pierre's face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized
1|Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him
1|from side to side till Anatole's face showed a sufficient degree of
1|terror.
1|
1|"When I tell you that I must talk to you!..." repeated Pierre.
1|
1|"Come now, this is stupid. What?" said Anatole, fingering a button
1|of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.
1|
1|"You're a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don't know what deprives
1|me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!" said Pierre,
1|expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.
1|
1|He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once
1|put it back in its place.
1|
1|"Did you promise to marry her?"
1|
1|"I... I didn't think of it. I never promised, because..."
1|
1|Pierre interrupted him.
1|
1|"Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?" he said, moving
1|toward Anatole.
1|
1|Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his
1|pocket and drew out his pocketbook.
1|
1|Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table
1|that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.
1|
1|"I shan't be violent, don't be afraid!" said Pierre in answer to a
1|frightened gesture of Anatole's. "First, the letters," said he, as
1|if repeating a lesson to himself. "Secondly," he continued after a
1|short pause, again rising and again pacing the room, "tomorrow you
1|must get out of Moscow."
1|
1|"But how can I?..."
1|
1|"Thirdly," Pierre continued without listening to him, "you must
1|never breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess
1|Rostova. I know I can't prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark
1|of conscience..." Pierre paced the room several times in silence.
1|
1|Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.
1|
1|"After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there
1|is such a thing as other people's happiness and peace, and that you
1|are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse
1|yourself with women like my wife--with them you are within your
1|rights, for they know what you want of them. They are armed against
1|you by the same experience of debauchery; but to promise a maid to
1|marry her... to deceive, to kidnap.... Don't you understand that it is
1|as mean as beating an old man or a child?..."
1|
1|Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with
1|a questioning look.
1|
1|"I don't know about that, eh?" said Anatole, growing more
1|confident as Pierre mastered his wrath. "I don't know that and don't
1|want to," he said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of
1|his lower jaw, "but you have used such words to me--'mean' and so
1|on--which as a man of honor I can't allow anyone to use."
1|
1|Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he
1|wanted.
1|
1|"Though it was tete-a-tete," Anatole continued, "still I can't..."
1|
1|"Is it satisfaction you want?" said Pierre ironically.
1|
1|"You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do
1|as you wish, eh?"
1|
1|"I take them back, I take them back!" said Pierre, "and I ask you to
1|forgive me." Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. "And if
1|you require money for your journey..."
1|
1|Anatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile,
1|which Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.
1|
1|"Oh, vile and heartless brood!" he exclaimed, and left the room.
1|
1|Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|Pierre drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her of the fulfillment of
1|her wish that Kuragin should be banished from Moscow. The whole
1|house was in a state of alarm and commotion. Natasha was very ill,
1|having, as Marya Dmitrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the
1|night after she had been told that Anatole was married, with some
1|arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she had
1|been so frightened that she woke Sonya and told her what she had done.
1|The necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was
1|now out of danger, though still so weak that it was out of the
1|question to move her to the country, and so the countess had been sent
1|for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and Sonya, who had a
1|tear-stained face, but he could not see Natasha.
1|
1|Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip
1|about the attempted abduction of Rostova. He resolutely denied these
1|rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
1|brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to
1|Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and
1|re-establish Natasha's reputation.
1|
1|He was awaiting Prince Andrew's return with dread and went every day
1|to the old prince's for news of him.
1|
1|Old Prince Bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which
1|Natasha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits
1|than usual and awaited his son with great impatience.
1|
1|Some days after Anatole's departure Pierre received a note from
1|Prince Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come
1|to see him.
1|
1|As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his
1|father Natasha's note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement
1|(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and
1|given it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of
1|Natasha's elopement, with additions.
1|
1|Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see
1|him next morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost
1|the same state as Natasha and was therefore surprised on entering
1|the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated
1|voice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince's
1|voice and another now and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out
1|to meet Pierre. She sighed, looking toward the door of the room
1|where Prince Andrew was, evidently intending to express her sympathy
1|with his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her face that she was glad both
1|at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news
1|of Natasha's faithlessness.
1|
1|"He says he expected it," she remarked. "I know his pride will not
1|let him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far
1|better, than I expected. Evidently it had to be...."
1|
1|"But is it possible that all is really ended?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not
1|understand how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the
1|study. Prince Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health,
1|but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in
1|civilian dress facing his father and Prince Meshcherski, warmly
1|disputing and vigorously gesticulating. The conversation was about
1|Speranski--the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had
1|just reached Moscow.
1|
1|"Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about
1|him a month ago," Prince Andrew was saying, "and by those who were
1|unable to understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and
1|to throw on him all the blame of other men's mistakes is very easy,
1|but I maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this
1|reign it was done by him, by him alone."
1|
1|He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and
1|immediately assumed a vindictive expression.
1|
1|"Posterity will do him justice," he concluded, and at once turned to
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?" he said with
1|animation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. "Yes, I am
1|well," he said in answer to Pierre's question, and smiled.
1|
1|To Pierre that smile said plainly: "I am well, but my health is
1|now of no use to anyone."
1|
1|After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish
1|frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre,
1|and about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his
1|son's tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation
1|about Speranski which was still going on between the two old men.
1|
1|"If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,
1|they would have been made public," he said with warmth and haste. "I
1|do not, and never did, like Speranski personally, but I like justice!"
1|
1|Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only
1|too familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous
1|matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too
1|intimate. When Prince Meshcherski had left, Prince Andrew took
1|Pierre's arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A
1|bed had been made up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks
1|stood about. Prince Andrew went to one and took out a small casket,
1|from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently
1|and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his
1|lips compressed.
1|
1|"Forgive me for troubling you..."
1|
1|Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natasha, and his
1|broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated
1|Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he
1|continued:
1|
1|"I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard
1|reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of
1|that kind. Is that true?"
1|
1|"Both true and untrue," Pierre began; but Prince Andrew
1|interrupted him.
1|
1|"Here are her letters and her portrait," said he.
1|
1|He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.
1|
1|"Give this to the countess... if you see her."
1|
1|"She is very ill," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Then she is here still?" said Prince Andrew. "And Prince
1|Kuragin?" he added quickly.
1|
1|"He left long ago. She has been at death's door."
1|
1|"I much regret her illness," said Prince Andrew; and he smiled
1|like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.
1|
1|"So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova with his
1|hand?" said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.
1|
1|"He could not marry, for he was married already," said Pierre.
1|
1|Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his
1|father.
1|
1|"And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?" he said.
1|
1|"He has gone to Peters... But I don't know," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Well, it doesn't matter," said Prince Andrew. "Tell Countess
1|Rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all
1|that is good."
1|
1|Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember
1|whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre
1|would say anything, looked fixedly at him.
1|
1|"I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?" asked Pierre,
1|"about..."
1|
1|"Yes," returned Prince Andrew hastily. "I said that a fallen woman
1|should be forgiven, but I didn't say I could forgive her. I can't."
1|
1|"But can this be compared...?" said Pierre.
1|
1|Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: "Yes, ask her
1|hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very
1|noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman's footsteps. If you
1|wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well,
1|good-by. So you'll give her the packet?"
1|
1|Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.
1|
1|The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same
1|as always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed
1|her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at
1|them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
1|Rostovs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to
1|mention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone
1|else.
1|
1|At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was
1|becoming evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with
1|his father, now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an
1|unnatural animation, the cause of which Pierre so well understood.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|That same evening Pierre went to the Rostovs' to fulfill the
1|commission entrusted to him. Natasha was in bed, the count at the
1|Club, and Pierre, after giving the letters to Sonya, went to Marya
1|Dmitrievna who was interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken
1|the news. Ten minutes later Sonya came to Marya Dmitrievna.
1|
1|"Natasha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirilovich," said she.
1|
1|"But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not
1|been tidied up."
1|
1|"No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room," said Sonya.
1|
1|Marya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders.
1|
1|"When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind,
1|don't tell her everything!" said she to Pierre. "One hasn't the
1|heart to scold her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be
1|pitied."
1|
1|Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated,
1|with a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected
1|to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently
1|undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.
1|
1|Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as
1|usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her
1|arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she
1|went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different
1|expression of face.
1|
1|"Peter Kirilovich," she began rapidly, "Prince Bolkonski was your
1|friend--is your friend," she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that
1|everything that had once been must now be different.) "He told me once
1|to apply to you..."
1|
1|Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then
1|he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he
1|now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for
1|reproach.
1|
1|"He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!" She stopped
1|and breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.
1|
1|"Yes... I will tell him," answered Pierre; "but..."
1|
1|He did not know what to say.
1|
1|Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think
1|she had meant.
1|
1|"No, I know all is over," she said hurriedly. "No, that can never
1|be. I'm only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only
1|that I beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything...."
1|
1|She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.
1|
1|A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre's heart.
1|
1|"I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more," said
1|Pierre. "But... I should like to know one thing...."
1|
1|"Know what?" Natasha's eyes asked.
1|
1|"I should like to know, did you love..." Pierre did not know how
1|to refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him--"did you love
1|that bad man?"
1|
1|"Don't call him bad!" said Natasha. "But I don't know, don't know at
1|all...."
1|
1|She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness,
1|and love welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his
1|spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.
1|
1|"We won't speak of it any more, my dear," said Pierre, and his
1|gentle, cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natasha.
1|
1|"We won't speak of it, my dear--I'll tell him everything; but one
1|thing I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help,
1|advice, or simply to open your heart to someone--not now, but when
1|your mind is clearer think of me!" He took her hand and kissed it.
1|"I shall be happy if it's in my power..."
1|
1|Pierre grew confused.
1|
1|"Don't speak to me like that. I am not worth it!" exclaimed
1|Natasha and turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.
1|
1|He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it
1|he was amazed at his own words.
1|
1|"Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you," said he to her.
1|
1|"Before me? No! All is over for me," she replied with shame and
1|self-abasement.
1|
1| "All over?" he repeated. "If I were not myself, but the handsomest,
1|cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this
1|moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love!"
1|
1|For the first time for many days Natasha wept tears of gratitude and
1|tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.
1|
1|Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom,
1|restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without
1|finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his
1|sleigh.
1|
1|"Where to now, your excellency?" asked the coachman.
1|
1|"Where to?" Pierre asked himself. "Where can I go now? Surely not to
1|the Club or to pay calls?" All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in
1|comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in
1|comparison with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him
1|through her tears.
1|
1|"Home!" said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost
1|Fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and
1|inhaled the air with joy.
1|
1|It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the
1|black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky
1|did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
1|things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been
1|raised. At the entrance to the Arbat Square an immense expanse of dark
1|starry sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it,
1|above the Prechistenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all
1|sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the
1|earth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous
1|and brilliant comet of 1812--the comet which was said to portend all
1|kinds of woes and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet
1|with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the
1|contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright
1|comet which, having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity
1|through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly--like an arrow piercing
1|the earth--to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its
1|tail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless
1|other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet fully
1|responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul,
1|now blossoming into a new life.

1|BOOK NINE: 1812
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating
1|of the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these
1|forces--millions of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the
1|army--moved from the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward
1|which since 1811 Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the
1|twelfth of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe crossed the
1|Russian frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed
1|to human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated
1|against one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries,
1|thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms,
1|and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of
1|all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed them
1|did not at the time regard as being crimes.
1|
1|What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes?
1|The historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the
1|wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the
1|Continental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of
1|Alexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.
1|
1|Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,
1|Rumyantsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to
1|have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for
1|Napoleon to have written to Alexander: "My respected Brother, I
1|consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg"--and there
1|would have been no war.
1|
1|We can understand that the matter seemed like that to
1|contemporaries. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was
1|caused by England's intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St.
1|Helena). It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that
1|the cause of the war was Napoleon's ambition; to the Duke of
1|Oldenburg, that the cause of the war was the violence done to him;
1|to businessmen that the cause of the war was the Continental System
1|which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the
1|chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them
1|employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of
1|re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that
1|time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
1|Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed
1|from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178.
1|It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of
1|other reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points
1|of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to
1|posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
1|perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem
1|insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of
1|Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon
1|was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England's policy was
1|astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what
1|connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter
1|and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men
1|from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smolensk
1|and Moscow and were killed by them.
1|
1|To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried
1|away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
1|with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes
1|present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes
1|the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of
1|causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by
1|its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its
1|impotence--apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident
1|causes--to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or
1|that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as
1|Napoleon's refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to
1|restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and
1|had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also
1|refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon's army and
1|the war could not have occurred.
1|
1|Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
1|beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would
1|have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a
1|second term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there
1|have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of
1|Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been
1|an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a
1|subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced
1|the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing
1|could have happened. So all these causes--myriads of causes--coincided
1|to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that
1|occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men,
1|renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to
1|east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes
1|of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.
1|
1|The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed
1|to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who
1|was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not
1|be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on
1|whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the
1|concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of
1|which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that
1|millions of men in whose hands lay the real power--the soldiers who
1|fired, or transported provisions and guns--should consent to carry out
1|the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do
1|so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.
1|
1|We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of
1|irrational events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of
1|which we do not understand). The more we try to explain such events in
1|history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they
1|become to us.
1|
1|Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal
1|aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain
1|from doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that
1|action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and
1|belongs to history, in which it has not a free but a predestined
1|significance.
1|
1|There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life,
1|which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his
1|elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for
1|him.
1|
1|Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious
1|instrument in the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of
1|humanity. A deed done is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in
1|time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic
1|significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more
1|people he is connected with and the more power he has over others, the
1|more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every
1|action.
1|
1|"The king's heart is in the hands of the Lord."
1|
1|A king is history's slave.
1|
1|History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind,
1|uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.
1|
1|Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever
1|that it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses
1|peuples*--as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote
1|him--he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which
1|compelled him, while thinking that he was acting on his own volition,
1|to perform for the hive life--that is to say, for history--whatever
1|had to be performed.
1|
1|
1|*"To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples."
1|
1|
1|The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and
1|by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and
1|co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the
1|nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg's
1|wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia--undertaken (as it
1|seemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace,
1|the French Emperor's love and habit of war coinciding with his
1|people's inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations,
1|and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining
1|advantages to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors
1|he received in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the
1|opinion of contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to
1|attain peace, but which only wounded the self-love of both sides,
1|and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to
1|the event that was happening or coincided with it.
1|
1|When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of
1|its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it
1|is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes
1|it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it?
1|
1|Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions
1|in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the
1|botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue
1|decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under
1|the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and
1|prayed for it. Equally right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon
1|went to Moscow because he wanted to, and perished because Alexander
1|desired his destruction, and he who says that an undermined hill
1|weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for
1|the last time with his mattock. In historic events the so-called great
1|men are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but
1|the smallest connection with the event itself.
1|
1|Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will,
1|is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole
1|course of history and predestined from eternity.
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent
1|three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,
1|and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the
1|emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings
1|and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and
1|diamonds of his own--that is, which he had taken from other kings--to
1|the Empress of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us,
1|tenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise--who regarded him as her
1|husband, though he had left another wife in Paris--left her grieved by
1|the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear. Though the
1|diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and
1|worked zealously to that end, and though the Emperor Napoleon himself
1|wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him Monsieur mon frere, and
1|sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love
1|and honor him--yet he set off to join his army, and at every station
1|gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west
1|to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses, surrounded by
1|pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to Posen, Thorn,
1|Danzig, and Konigsberg. At each of these towns thousands of people met
1|him with excitement and enthusiasm.
1|
1|The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses
1|carried him in the same direction. On the tenth of June,* coming up
1|with the army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on
1|the estate of a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.
1|
1|
1|*Old style.
1|
1|
1|Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the
1|Niemen, and, changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank
1|in order to select a place for the crossing.
1|
1|Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the
1|wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of
1|Moscow (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the
1|Scythia into which Alexander the Great had marched--Napoleon
1|unexpectedly, and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic
1|considerations, ordered an advance, and the next day his army began to
1|cross the Niemen.
1|
1|Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,
1|which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and
1|looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out
1|of the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown
1|across the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor's presence,
1|were on the lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in
1|an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of
1|his tent on the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: "Vive
1|l'Empereur!" and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of
1|the vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and
1|on by the three bridges to the other side.
1|
1|"Now we'll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself,
1|things get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l'Empereur! So
1|these are the steppes of Asia! It's a nasty country all the same. Au
1|revoir, Beauche; I'll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au
1|revoir. Good luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l'Empereur!...
1|preur!--If they make me Governor of India, Gerard, I'll make you
1|Minister of Kashmir--that's settled. Vive l'Empereur! Hurrah!
1|hurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks--those rascals--see how they run! Vive
1|l'Empereur! There he is, do you see him? I've seen him twice, as I see
1|you now. The little corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the
1|veterans.... Vive l'Empereur!" came the voices of men, old and
1|young, of most diverse characters and social positions. On the faces
1|of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the
1|long-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the
1|gray coat who was standing on the hill.
1|
1|On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse
1|was brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one
1|of the bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant
1|and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because
1|it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of
1|him by such shouting, but the shouting which accompanied him
1|everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares
1|that had occupied him from the time he joined the army. He rode across
1|one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side, turned sharply
1|to the left, and galloped in the direction of Kovno, preceded by
1|enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard who, breathless with
1|delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops. On
1|reaching the broad river Viliya, he stopped near a regiment of
1|Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.
1|
1|"Vivat!" shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and
1|pressing against one another to see him.
1|
1|Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a
1|log that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was
1|handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run
1|up to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became
1|absorbed in a map laid out on the logs. Without lifting his head he
1|said something, and two of his aides-de-camp galloped off to the
1|Polish Uhlans.
1|
1|"What? What did he say?" was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans
1|when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.
1|
1|The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel
1|of the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his
1|speech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be
1|permitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford.
1|In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on
1|a horse, he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the
1|Emperor's eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor
1|would not be displeased at this excess of zeal.
1|
1|As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached
1|officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted
1|"Vivat!" and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse
1|and galloped into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse,
1|which had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading
1|for the deepest part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans
1|galloped in after him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in
1|the middle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as
1|they fell off their horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some
1|of the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some
1|clinging to their horses' manes. They tried to make their way
1|forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford one third of
1|a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this
1|river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even
1|looking at what they were doing. When the aide-de-camp, having
1|returned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the
1|Emperor's attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the
1|little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned
1|Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving him
1|instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
1|drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.
1|
1|For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
1|the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough
1|to dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called
1|for his horse and rode to his quarters.
1|
1|Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were
1|sent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from
1|which they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and
1|with difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they
1|had got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted
1|"Vivat!" and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been
1|but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves
1|happy.
1|
1|That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian
1|paper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as
1|quickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a
1|letter containing information about the orders to the French army
1|had been found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish
1|colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled
1|in the Legion d'honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.
1|
1|Quos vult perdere dementat.*

1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vilna for more than
1|a month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for
1|the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor
1|had come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The
1|vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even
1|increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each
1|of the three armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no
1|supreme commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume
1|that responsibility himself.
1|
1|The longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody--tired
1|of waiting--prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded
1|the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time
1|pleasantly and forget that war was impending.
1|
1|In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by
1|the courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the
1|Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be
1|given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly
1|received. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected
1|money by subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to
1|the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a
1|landowner in the Vilna province, offered his country house for the
1|fete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner,
1|regatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen's country seat.
1|
1|The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and
1|his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian
1|frontier, Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by
1|his aides-de-camp at Bennigsen's country house.
1|
1|It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters
1|declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one
1|place. Countess Bezukhova was present among other Russian ladies who
1|had followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vilna and eclipsed the
1|refined Polish ladies by her massive, so called Russian type of
1|beauty. The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.
1|
1|Boris Drubetskoy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the
1|present en garcon (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not
1|an aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Boris
1|was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
1|patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of
1|his own age. He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen
1|her for a long time and did not recall the past, but as Helene was
1|enjoying the favors of a very important personage and Boris had only
1|recently married, they met as good friends of long standing.
1|
1|At midnight dancing was still going on. Helene, not having a
1|suitable partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Boris.
1|They were the third couple. Boris, coolly looking at Helene's dazzling
1|bare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze
1|gown, talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware
1|of it himself and unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased
1|to observe the Emperor who was in the same room. The Emperor was not
1|dancing, he stood in the doorway, stopping now one pair and now
1|another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter.
1|
1|As the mazurka began, Boris saw that Adjutant General Balashev,
1|one of those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him
1|and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to
1|a Polish lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked
1|inquiringly at Balashev and, evidently understanding that he only
1|acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing, nodded
1|slightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly had Balashev begun to
1|speak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor's face. He
1|took Balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him,
1|unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both
1|sides made way for him. Boris noticed Arakcheev's excited face when
1|the sovereign went out with Balashev. Arakcheev looked at the
1|Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped
1|forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him.
1|(Boris understood that Arakcheev envied Balashev and was displeased
1|that evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than
1|through himself.)
1|
1|But the Emperor and Balashev passed out into the illuminated
1|garden without noticing Arakcheev who, holding his sword and
1|glancing wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.
1|
1|All the time Boris was going through the figures of the mazurka,
1|he was worried by the question of what news Balashev had brought and
1|how he could find it out before others. In the figure in which he
1|had to choose two ladies, he whispered to Helene that he meant to
1|choose Countess Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the
1|veranda, and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the
1|garden, where, seeing Balashev and the Emperor returning to the
1|veranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. Boris,
1|fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw, respectfully pressed
1|close to the doorpost with bowed head.
1|
1|The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally
1|affronted, was finishing with these words:
1|
1|"To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as
1|long as a single armed enemy remains in my country!" It seemed to
1|Boris that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was
1|satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but
1|displeased that Boris had overheard it.
1|
1|"Let no one know of it!" the Emperor added with a frown.
1|
1|Boris understood that this was meant for him and, closing his
1|eyes, slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and
1|remained there about another half-hour.
1|
1|Boris was thus the first to learn the news that the French army
1|had crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain
1|important personages that much that was concealed from others was
1|usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their
1|estimation.
1|
1|
1|The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was
1|particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations,
1|and at a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of
1|indignation and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased
1|him, fully expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On
1|returning home at two o'clock that night he sent for his secretary,
1|Shishkov, and told him to write an order to the troops and a
1|rescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltykov, in which he insisted on the
1|words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a
1|single armed Frenchman remained on Russian soil.
1|
1|Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:
1|
1|
1|Monsieur mon frere,
1|
1|Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept my
1|engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian
1|frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in
1|which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression,
1|that Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with
1|me from the time Prince Kuragin asked for his passports. The reasons
1|on which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him
1|would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a
1|pretext for aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has
1|declared, was never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I
1|was informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and
1|ordered him to remain at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend
1|to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding, and
1|consents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory, I will regard
1|what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us
1|will be possible. In the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see
1|myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked.
1|It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the
1|calamity of another war. I am, etc.,
1|                                         (signed) Alexander
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having
1|sent for Balashev and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him
1|to take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When
1|dispatching Balashev, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he
1|would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on
1|Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon.
1|Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because
1|with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use
1|them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made,
1|but he definitely instructed Balashev to repeat them personally to
1|Napoleon.
1|
1|Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied
1|by a bugler and two Cossacks, Balashev reached the French outposts
1|at the village of Rykonty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn.
1|There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.
1|
1|A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform
1|and a shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt.
1|Balashev did not do so at once, but continued to advance along the
1|road at a walking pace.
1|
1|The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,
1|advanced his horse's chest against Balashev, put his hand to his
1|saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he
1|deaf that he did not do as he was told? Balashev mentioned who he was.
1|The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about
1|regimental matters without looking at the Russian general.
1|
1|After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after
1|conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in
1|general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the
1|service, Balashev found it very strange here on Russian soil to
1|encounter this hostile, and still more this disrespectful, application
1|of brute force to himself.
1|
1|The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air
1|was fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road
1|from the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one
1|after another, like bubbles rising in water.
1|
1|Balashev looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer
1|from the village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French
1|hussars looked silently at one another from time to time.
1|
1|A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed,
1|came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse,
1|accompanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their
1|horses all looked smart and well kept.
1|
1|It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
1|trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of
1|martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
1|of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.
1|
1|The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was
1|polite and evidently understood Balashev's importance. He led him past
1|his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to
1|be presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied
1|immediately, as the Emperor's quarters were, he believed, not far off.
1|
1|They rode through the village of Rykonty, past tethered French
1|hussar horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and
1|stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the
1|other end of the village. The colonel said that the commander of the
1|division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balashev
1|and conduct him to his destination.
1|
1|The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.
1|
1|They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a
1|group of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a
1|black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall
1|man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his
1|shoulders. He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long legs forward
1|in French fashion. This man rode toward Balashev at a gallop, his
1|plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright
1|June sunshine.
1|
1|Balashev was only two horses' length from the equestrian with the
1|bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was
1|galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when
1|Julner, the French colonel, whispered respectfully: "The King of
1|Naples!" It was, in fact, Murat, now called "King of Naples." Though
1|it was quite incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he
1|was called so, and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore
1|assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly. He was so
1|sure that he really was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of
1|his departure from that city, while walking through the streets with
1|his wife, some Italians called out to him: "Viva il re!"* he turned to
1|his wife with a pensive smile and said: "Poor fellows, they don't know
1|that I am leaving them tomorrow!"
1|
1|
1|*"Long live the king."
1|
1|
1|But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and
1|pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly,
1|after he had been ordered to return to military service--and
1|especially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when
1|his august brother-in-law had told him: "I made you King that you
1|should reign in my way, but not in yours!"--he had cheerfully taken up
1|his familiar business, and--like a well-fed but not overfat horse that
1|feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts--he
1|dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible, and
1|gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of Poland, without
1|himself knowing why or whither.
1|
1|On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its
1|long hair curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner,
1|and looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully
1|informed His Majesty of Balashev's mission, whose name he could not
1|pronounce.
1|
1|"De Bal-macheve!" said the King (overcoming by his assurance the
1|difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). "Charmed to make
1|your acquaintance, General!" he added, with a gesture of kingly
1|condescension.
1|
1|As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
1|instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his
1|natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the
1|withers of Balashev's horse and said:
1|
1|"Well, General, it all looks like war," as if regretting a
1|circumstance of which he was unable to judge.
1|
1|"Your Majesty," replied Balashev, "my master, the Emperor, does
1|not desire war and as Your Majesty sees..." said Balashev, using the
1|words Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation
1|unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a
1|novelty.
1|
1|Murat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to
1|"Monsieur de Bal-macheve." But royaute oblige!* and he felt it
1|incumbent on him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs
1|with Alexander's envoy. He dismounted, took Balashev's arm, and moving
1|a few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to
1|pace up and down with him, trying to speak significantly. He
1|referred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand
1|that he should withdraw his troops from Prussia, especially when
1|that demand became generally known and the dignity of France was
1|thereby offended.
1|
1|
1|*"Royalty has its obligations."
1|
1|
1|Balashev replied that there was "nothing offensive in the demand,
1|because..." but Murat interrupted him.
1|
1|"Then you don't consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?" he
1|asked unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.
1|
1|Balashev told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of
1|the war.
1|
1|"Oh, my dear general!" Murat again interrupted him, "with all my
1|heart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and
1|that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as
1|possible!" said he, in the tone of a servant who wants to remain
1|good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters.
1|
1|And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of
1|his health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had
1|spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal
1|dignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which
1|he had stood at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:
1|
1|"I won't detain you longer, General. I wish success to your
1|mission," and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers,
1|and his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were
1|respectfully awaiting him.
1|
1|Balashev rode on, supposing from Murat's words that he would very
1|soon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the
1|next village the sentinels of Davout's infantry corps detained him
1|as the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the
1|corps commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to
1|Marshal Davout.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|Davout was to Napoleon what Arakcheev was to Alexander--though not a
1|coward like Arakcheev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to
1|express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.
1|
1|In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are
1|necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always
1|appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and
1|their proximity to the head of the government may be. This
1|inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakcheev, who tore
1|out a grenadier's mustache with his own hands, whose weak nerves
1|rendered him unable to face danger, and who was neither an educated
1|man nor a courtier, was able to maintain his powerful position with
1|Alexander, whose own character was chivalrous, noble, and gentle.
1|
1|Balashev found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a
1|peasant's hut, writing--he was auditing accounts. Better quarters
1|could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who
1|purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a
1|justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they are always
1|hard at work and in a hurry. "How can I think of the bright side of
1|life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty
1|shed?" the expression of his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure
1|and necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows
1|animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity.
1|Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balashev was brought in.
1|He became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian general
1|entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at Balashev's face,
1|which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with
1|Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and
1|sneered malevolently.
1|
1|When he noticed in Balashev's face the disagreeable impression
1|this reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked
1|what he wanted.
1|
1|Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
1|Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor
1|Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashev hastened to
1|inform him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation,
1|Davout, after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.
1|
1|"Where is your dispatch?" he inquired. "Give it to me. I will send
1|it to the Emperor."
1|
1|Balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to
1|the Emperor.
1|
1|"Your Emperor's orders are obeyed in your army, but here," said
1|Davout, "you must do as you're told."
1|
1|And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his
1|dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
1|on duty.
1|
1|Balashev took out the packet containing the Emperor's letter and
1|laid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging
1|on it, laid across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the
1|inscription.
1|
1|"You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,"
1|protested Balashev, "but permit me to observe that I have the honor to
1|be adjutant general to His Majesty...."
1|
1|Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
1|signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashev's face.
1|
1|"You will be treated as is fitting," said he and, putting the packet
1|in his pocket, left the shed.
1|
1|A minute later the marshal's adjutant, de Castres, came in and
1|conducted Balashev to the quarters assigned him.
1|
1|That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the
1|barrels.
1|
1|Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashev to come to
1|him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the
1|baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one
1|except Monsieur de Castres.
1|
1|After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his
1|impotence and insignificance--particularly acute by contrast with
1|the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved--and after several
1|marches with the marshal's baggage and the French army, which occupied
1|the whole district, Balashev was brought to Vilna--now occupied by the
1|French--through the very gate by which he had left it four days
1|previously.
1|
1|Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne,
1|came to Balashev and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon's wish to
1|honor him with an audience.
1|
1|Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment had
1|stood in front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, and now
1|two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front
1|and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and
1|Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals,
1|who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch,
1|round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received
1|Balashev in the very house in Vilna from which Alexander had
1|dispatched him on his mission.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Though Balashev was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the
1|luxury and magnificence of Napoleon's court.
1|
1|The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
1|generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates--several of whom
1|Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia--were waiting.
1|Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before
1|going for his ride.
1|
1|After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came
1|into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashev
1|to follow him.
1|
1|Balashev went into a small reception room, one door of which led
1|into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had
1|dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He
1|heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened
1|rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of
1|other steps, firm and resolute--they were those of Napoleon. He had
1|just finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform,
1|opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his
1|rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat
1|thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had
1|evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of
1|his broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the
1|black collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His
1|full face, rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a
1|gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome.
1|
1|He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head
1|slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad
1|thick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had
1|that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live
1|in comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits
1|that day.
1|
1|He nodded in answer to Balashav's low and respectful bow, and coming
1|up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of
1|his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but
1|is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well.
1|
1|"Good day, General!" said he. "I have received the letter you
1|brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you." He
1|glanced with his large eyes into Balashav's face and immediately
1|looked past him.
1|
1|It was plain that Balashev's personality did not interest him at
1|all. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested
1|him. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because
1|everything in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his
1|will.
1|
1|"I do not, and did not, desire war," he continued, "but it has
1|been forced on me. Even now" (he emphasized the word) "I am ready to
1|receive any explanations you can give me."
1|
1|And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
1|dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly
1|moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev
1|was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter
1|into negotiations.
1|
1|When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the
1|Russian envoy, Balashev began a speech he had prepared long before:
1|"Sire! The Emperor, my master..." but the sight of the Emperor's
1|eyes bent on him confused him. "You are flurried--compose yourself!"
1|Napoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked
1|at Balashev's uniform and sword.
1|
1|Balashev recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the
1|Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin's demand for his
1|passports a sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on his
1|own initiative and without his sovereign's assent, that the Emperor
1|Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with England.
1|
1|"Not yet!" interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to
1|his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev
1|might proceed.
1|
1|After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashev added
1|that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter
1|into negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashev hesitated:
1|he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his
1|letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov and had
1|told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered these
1|words, "So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil," but
1|some complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though
1|he wished to do so. He grew confused and said: "On condition that
1|the French army retires beyond the Niemen."
1|
1|Napoleon noticed Balashev's embarrassment when uttering these last
1|words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to
1|quiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began
1|speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the
1|speech that followed, Balashev, who more than once lowered his eyes,
1|involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon's left leg which
1|increased the more Napoleon raised his voice.
1|
1|"I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander," he began.
1|"Have I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it?
1|I have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to
1|begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?" he said, frowning and
1|making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump
1|hand.
1|
1|"The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire," replied
1|Balashev.
1|
1|"The Niemen?" repeated Napoleon. "So now you want me to retire
1|beyond the Niemen--only the Niemen?" repeated Napoleon, looking
1|straight at Balashev.
1|
1|The latter bowed his head respectfully.
1|
1|Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from
1|Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded.
1|Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.
1|
1|"You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen
1|before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months
1|ago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the
1|Oder, and yet you are willing to negotiate."
1|
1|He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and
1|again stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev noticed that his left leg
1|was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in
1|its stern expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing
1|Napoleon was conscious of. "The vibration of my left calf is a great
1|sign with me," he remarked at a later date.
1|
1|"Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be
1|made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!" Napoleon almost screamed,
1|quite to his own surprise. "If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I
1|could not accept such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But
1|who first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer
1|me negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in
1|alliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You
1|offer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with
1|England? What has she given you?" he continued hurriedly, evidently no
1|longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its
1|possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and
1|Alexander's errors and duplicity.
1|
1|The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
1|intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and
1|showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had
1|begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his
1|words.
1|
1|The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt
1|himself and insult Alexander--just what he had least desired at the
1|commencement of the interview.
1|
1|"I hear you have made peace with Turkey?"
1|
1|Balashev bowed his head affirmatively.
1|
1|"Peace has been concluded..." he began.
1|
1|But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all
1|the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of
1|eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so
1|prone.
1|
1|"Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining
1|Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those
1|provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes," he went on, "I promised and
1|would have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now
1|he won't have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united
1|them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia
1|from the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the
1|Great could not have done more," said Napoleon, growing more and
1|more excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashev
1|almost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. "All
1|that, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!"
1|he repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold
1|snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.
1|
1|"What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander's might have been!"
1|
1|He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the latter
1|tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.
1|
1|"What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained
1|through my friendship?" demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in
1|perplexity. "But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my
1|enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and
1|Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;
1|Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French
1|subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all
1|the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who
1|should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander's mind....
1|Granted that were they competent they might be made use of," continued
1|Napoleon--hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
1|that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in
1|his perception the two were one and the same)--"but they are not even
1|that! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be
1|the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his
1|first movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel
1|proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called
1|on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing
1|no result. Bagration alone is a military man. He's stupid, but he has
1|experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your
1|young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and
1|throw on him the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign
1|should not be with the army unless he is a general!" said Napoleon,
1|evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor.
1|He knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander.
1|
1|"The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven't even been
1|able to defend Vilna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of
1|the Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling."
1|
1|"On the contrary, Your Majesty," said Balashev, hardly able to
1|remember what had been said to him and following these verbal
1|fireworks with difficulty, "the troops are burning with eagerness..."
1|
1|"I know everything!" Napoleon interrupted him. "I know everything. I
1|know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You
1|have not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number.
1|I give you my word of honor," said Napoleon, forgetting that his
1|word of honor could carry no weight--"I give you my word of honor that
1|I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the
1|Vistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing
1|and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes--it is
1|their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they
1|changed him for another--Bernadotte, who promptly went mad--for no
1|Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad."
1|
1|Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his
1|nose.
1|
1|Balashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon's remarks, and
1|would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing
1|to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the
1|alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply that when
1|Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon
1|gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that
1|state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk,
1|merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balashev began
1|to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and
1|felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the
1|transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He
1|knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any
1|significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
1|when he came to his senses. Balashev stood with downcast eyes, looking
1|at the movements of Napoleon's stout legs and trying to avoid
1|meeting his eyes.
1|
1|"But what do I care about your allies?" said Napoleon. "I have
1|allies--the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight
1|like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them."
1|
1|And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered
1|this obvious falsehood, and that Balashev still stood silently
1|before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon
1|abruptly turned round, drew close to Balashev's face, and,
1|gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost
1|shouted:
1|
1|"Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I'll wipe it off the
1|map of Europe!" he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and
1|he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. "Yes, I
1|will throw you back beyond the Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and
1|will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind
1|of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to
1|you. That is what you have gained by alienating me!" And he walked
1|silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders
1|twitching.
1|
1|He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again,
1|lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashev.
1|He paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev's eyes, and said
1|in a quiet voice:
1|
1|"And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!"
1|
1|Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
1|Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon
1|was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not
1|listening to him. Balashev said that in Russia the best results were
1|expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to
1|say, "I know it's your duty to say that, but you don't believe it
1|yourself. I have convinced you."
1|
1|When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox,
1|sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal.
1|The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully,
1|handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket
1|handkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to
1|Balashev:
1|
1|"Assure the Emperor Alexander from me," said he, taking his hat,
1|"that I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very
1|highly esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer,
1|General; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor."
1|
1|And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception
1|room rushed forward and descended the staircase.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|After all that Napoleon had said to him--those bursts of anger and
1|the last dryly spoken words: "I will detain you no longer, General;
1|you shall receive my letter," Balashev felt convinced that Napoleon
1|would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with
1|him--an insulted envoy--especially as he had witnessed his unseemly
1|anger. But, to his surprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an
1|invitation to dine with the Emperor that day.
1|
1|Bessieres, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.
1|
1|Napoleon met Balashev cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed
1|no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that
1|morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashev. It was
1|evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him
1|to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was
1|right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but
1|because he did it.
1|
1|The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vilna,
1|where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him.
1|From all the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs,
1|flags, and his monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies,
1|welcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him.
1|
1|At dinner, having placed Balashev beside him, Napoleon not only
1|treated him amiably but behaved as if Balashev were one of his own
1|courtiers, one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to
1|rejoice at his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned
1|Moscow and questioned Balashev about the Russian capital, not merely
1|as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit,
1|but as if convinced that Balashev, as a Russian, must be flattered
1|by his curiosity.
1|
1|"How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it
1|true that Moscow is called 'Holy Moscow'? How many churches are
1|there in Moscow?" he asked.
1|
1|And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred
1|churches, he remarked:
1|
1|"Why such a quantity of churches?"
1|
1|"The Russians are very devout," replied Balashev.
1|
1|"But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign
1|of the backwardness of a people," said Napoleon, turning to
1|Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark.
1|
1|Balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.
1|
1|"Every country has its own character," said he.
1|
1|"But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that," said Napoleon.
1|
1|"I beg your Majesty's pardon," returned Balashev, "besides Russia
1|there is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries."
1|
1|This reply of Balashev's, which hinted at the recent defeats of
1|the French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at
1|Alexander's court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon's
1|dinner, where it passed unnoticed.
1|
1|The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that
1|they were puzzled as to what Balashev's tone suggested. "If there is a
1|point we don't see it, or it is not at all witty," their expressions
1|seemed to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon
1|did not notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns
1|the direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashev, who was on
1|the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as "all roads lead
1|to Rome," so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and
1|"among them the road through Poltava, which Charles XII chose."
1|Balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this
1|reply, but hardly had he uttered the word Poltava before
1|Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg
1|to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.
1|
1|After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon's study, which
1|four days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander.
1|Napoleon sat down, toying with his Sevres coffee cup, and motioned
1|Balashev to a chair beside him.
1|
1|Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than
1|any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
1|consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was
1|surrounded by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after
1|his dinner, Balashev too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned
1|to him with a pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.
1|
1|"They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied?
1|Strange, isn't it, General?" he said, evidently not doubting that this
1|remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his,
1|Napoleon's, superiority to Alexander.
1|
1|Balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence.
1|
1|"Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were
1|deliberating," continued Napoleon with the same derisive and
1|self-confident smile. "What I can't understand," he went on, "is
1|that the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal
1|enemies. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do
1|the same?" and he turned inquiringly to Balashev, and evidently this
1|thought turned him back on to the track of his morning's anger,
1|which was still fresh in him.
1|
1|"And let him know that I will do so!" said Napoleon, rising and
1|pushing his cup away with his hand. "I'll drive all his Wurttemberg,
1|Baden, and Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I'll drive them
1|out. Let him prepare an asylum for them in Russia!"
1|
1|Balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
1|make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help
1|hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;
1|he treated Balashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now
1|fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master's
1|humiliation.
1|
1|"And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What
1|is the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to
1|reign and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a
1|responsibility?"
1|
1|Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up
1|and down the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly,
1|went up to Balashev and with a slight smile, as confidently,
1|quickly, and simply as if he were doing something not merely
1|important but pleasing to Balashev, he raised his hand to the
1|forty-year-old Russian general's face and, taking him by the ear,
1|pulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.
1|
1|To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the
1|greatest honor and mark of favor at the French court.
1|
1|"Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don't you
1|say anything?" said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to
1|be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. "Are the
1|horses ready for the general?" he added, with a slight inclination
1|of his head in reply to Balashev's bow. "Let him have mine, he has a
1|long way to go!"
1|
1|The letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon sent to
1|Alexander. Every detail of the interview was communicated to the
1|Russian monarch, and the war began...
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to
1|Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet
1|Anatole Kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching
1|Petersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had already left the
1|city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on
1|his track. Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the
1|Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in
1|Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov, his former commander who was
1|always well disposed toward him, and Kutuzov suggested that he
1|should accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general
1|had been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having
1|received an appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.
1|
1|Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge
1|Kuragin. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause
1|it might compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he wanted to
1|meet Kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel.
1|But he again failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey, for soon after Prince
1|Andrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. In a new country,
1|amid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After
1|his betrothed had broken faith with him--which he felt the more
1|acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects--the surroundings
1|in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and
1|independence he had once prized so highly were still more so. Not only
1|could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he
1|lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later
1|enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at
1|Bogucharovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to
1|recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had
1|revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters
1|unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more
1|eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if
1|that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above
1|him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down,
1|in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
1|
1|Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was
1|the simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutuzov's
1|staff, he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and
1|surprised Kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not
1|having found Kuragin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it
1|necessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same he knew
1|that however long it might be before he met Kuragin, despite his
1|contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince
1|himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him--he knew
1|that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him
1|out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food. And
1|the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor
1|was still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial
1|tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of
1|restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.
1|
1|In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached
1|Bucharest--where Kutuzov had been living for two months, passing his
1|days and nights with a Wallachian woman--Prince Andrew asked Kutuzov
1|to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who was already weary of
1|Bolkonski's activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very
1|readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.
1|
1|Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped
1|at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on
1|his way, being only two miles off the Smolensk highroad. During the
1|last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had
1|thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east
1|and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange
1|and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the
1|same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone
1|pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were
1|entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness,
1|the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside
1|there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and
1|the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the
1|same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and
1|joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant
1|suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish,
1|self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full
1|of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more
1|self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had
1|brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and
1|talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same
1|narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old
1|prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which
1|left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was
1|the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and
1|skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas
1|alone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair,
1|and, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip
1|of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do.
1|He alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted,
1|sleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the
1|inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew
1|had seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and
1|hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met
1|because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince,
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess
1|Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.
1|
1|During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but
1|they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for
1|whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them
1|all feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first
1|day, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became
1|morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner.
1|In the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse
1|him, began to tell him of the young Count Kamensky's campaign, the old
1|prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for
1|her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he
1|said, was the only person really attached to him.
1|
1|The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of
1|Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and
1|that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince
1|Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter
1|and that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not
1|help tormenting her and that she deserved it. "Why does Prince Andrew,
1|who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me
1|a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own
1|daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He
1|doesn't understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,"
1|thought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put
1|up with his daughter's unreasonable character.
1|
1|"If you ask me," said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was
1|censuring his father for the first time in his life), "I did not
1|wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank
1|opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you
1|and Mary, I can't blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and
1|respects you. Since you ask me," continued Prince Andrew, becoming
1|irritable--as he was always liable to do of late--"I can only say that
1|if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless
1|woman, who is not fit to be my sister's companion."
1|
1|The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural
1|smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew
1|could not get accustomed.
1|
1|"What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You've already been talking it
1|over! Eh?"
1|
1|"Father, I did not want to judge," said Prince Andrew, in a hard and
1|bitter tone, "but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall
1|say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame--the one to
1|blame--is that Frenchwoman."
1|
1|"Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!" said the old man
1|in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some
1|embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: "Be off, be
1|off! Let not a trace of you remain here!..."
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded
1|him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did
1|not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne
1|and Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next
1|day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son's rooms. The boy,
1|curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,
1|and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell
1|into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this
1|pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He
1|sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or
1|regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms
1|with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more
1|to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former
1|tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the
1|boy and taking him on his knee.
1|
1|"Well, go on!" said his son.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went
1|out of the room.
1|
1|As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and
1|especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he
1|had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former
1|intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find
1|some work as soon as possible.
1|
1|"So you've decided to go, Andrew?" asked his sister.
1|
1|"Thank God that I can," replied Prince Andrew. "I am very sorry
1|you can't."
1|
1|"Why do you say that?" replied Princess Mary. "Why do you say
1|that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old?
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about you...."
1|
1|As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her
1|tears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the
1|room.
1|
1|"Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what--what trash--can
1|cause people misery!" he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess
1|Mary.
1|
1|She understood that when speaking of "trash" he referred not only to
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man
1|who had ruined his own happiness.
1|
1|"Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!" she said, touching
1|his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears.
1|"I understand you" (she looked down). "Don't imagine that sorrow is
1|the work of men. Men are His tools." She looked a little above
1|Prince Andrew's head with the confident, accustomed look with which
1|one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. "Sorrow is
1|sent by Him, not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to
1|blame. If you think someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We
1|have no right to punish. And then you will know the happiness of
1|forgiving."
1|
1|"If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman's virtue.
1|But a man should not and cannot forgive and forget," he replied, and
1|though till that moment he had not been thinking of Kuragin, all his
1|unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.
1|
1|"If Mary is already persuading me forgive, it means that I ought
1|long ago to have punished him," he thought. And giving her no
1|further reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he
1|would meet Kuragin who he knew was now in the army.
1|
1|Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she
1|knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being
1|reconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably
1|soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his
1|father, but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their
1|differences would become.
1|
1|"Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men
1|are never to blame," were the last words he heard from his sister when
1|he took leave of her.
1|
1|"Then it must be so!" thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the
1|avenue from the house at Bald Hills. "She, poor innocent creature,
1|is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits.
1|The old man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is
1|growing up and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he
1|will deceive or be deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself
1|don't know. I want to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give
1|him a chance to kill and laugh at me!"
1|
1|These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they
1|were all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only
1|senseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after
1|another to Prince Andrew's mind.
1|
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the
1|end of June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied
1|the fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying
1|to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be
1|cut off by large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the
1|general course of affairs in the Russian army, but no one
1|anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces, and no
1|one thought the war would extend farther than the western, the Polish,
1|provinces.
1|
1|Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on
1|the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large
1|village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals
1|and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of
1|the villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles.
1|Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He
1|received Bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign
1|accent that he would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to
1|his employment, but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff.
1|Anatole Kuragin, whom Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army,
1|was not there. He had gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad
1|to hear this. His mind was occupied by the interests of the center
1|that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a
1|while from the distraction caused by the thought of Kuragin. During
1|the first four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince
1|Andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own
1|knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion
1|about it. But the question whether the camp was advantageous or
1|disadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his military
1|experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come
1|to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no
1|significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of
1|the enemy--that cannot be foreseen--are met, and on how and by whom
1|the whole matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself,
1|Prince Andrew, utilizing his position and acquaintances, tried to
1|fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and
1|parties engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the following of the
1|state of affairs.
1|
1|While the Emperor had still been at Vilna, the forces had been
1|divided into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly,
1|secondly, the army under Bagration, and thirdly, the one commanded
1|by Tormasov. The Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander
1|in chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor
1|would take command, but only that he would be with the army. The
1|Emperor, moreover, had with him not a commander in chief's staff but
1|the imperial headquarters staff. In attendance on him was the head
1|of the imperial staff, Quartermaster General Prince Volkonski, as well
1|as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large
1|number of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides these, there
1|were in attendance on the Emperor without any definite appointments:
1|Arakcheev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general
1|in rank; the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich; Count
1|Rumyantsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister;
1|Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of
1|campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinian emigre;
1|Wolzogen--and many others. Though these men had no military
1|appointment in the army, their position gave them influence, and often
1|a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not know in
1|what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,
1|Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonski, or was given this or that advice and
1|did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice
1|emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it
1|had to be executed or not. But this was only the external condition;
1|the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all
1|these people, from a courtier's point of view (and in an Emperor's
1|vicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this:
1|the Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but
1|disposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants.
1|Arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the
1|sovereign's bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna
1|province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district, but
1|was in reality a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at
1|hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited
1|him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was
1|useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally.
1|Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of
1|self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.
1|Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The
1|adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
1|Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn
1|up the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander
1|to believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole
1|business of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel's
1|thoughts in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a
1|harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising
1|everyone else) was able to do.
1|
1|Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and
1|unexpected ideas every day--especially the foreigners, who did so with
1|a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their
1|own--there were many secondary personages accompanying the army
1|because their principals were there.
1|
1|Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless,
1|brilliant, and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following
1|sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties:
1|
1|The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents--military
1|theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws--laws
1|of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his
1|adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in
1|accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and
1|they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every
1|deviation from that theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles,
1|Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.
1|
1|The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme,
1|as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The
1|members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from
1|Vilna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides
1|being advocates of bold action, this section also represented
1|nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They
1|were Russians: Bagration, Ermolov (who was beginning to come to the
1|front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Ermolov's was
1|being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the
1|Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering
1|Suvorov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins
1|into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and
1|not let the army get discouraged.
1|
1|To the third party--in which the Emperor had most confidence--belonged
1|the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.
1|The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakcheev
1|belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish
1|to seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war,
1|particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him
1|Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound
1|scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at
1|the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often
1|one sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but
1|should also listen to what Pfuel's opponents and practical men of
1|experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course.
1|They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to
1|Pfuel's plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies.
1|Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be
1|attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.
1|
1|Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
1|Tsarevich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz,
1|where he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and
1|cavalry uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French
1|gallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had
1|narrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of this party had
1|both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They
1|feared Napoleon, recognized his strength and their own weakness, and
1|frankly said so. They said: "Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin
1|will come of all this! We have abandoned Vilna and Vitebsk and shall
1|abandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude
1|peace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of Petersburg."
1|
1|This view was very general in the upper army circles and found
1|support also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyantsev, who,
1|for other reasons of state, was in favor of peace.
1|
1|The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay
1|de Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in
1|chief. "Be he what he may" (they always began like that), "he is an
1|honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real
1|power, for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of
1|command, and he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our
1|army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa
1|without suffering any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If
1|Barclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for
1|Bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807."
1|
1|The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at
1|any rate there was no one more active and experienced than
1|Bennigsen: "and twist about as you may, you will have to come to
1|Bennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes now!" said they,
1|arguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse
1|and an unbroken series of blunders. "The more mistakes that are made
1|the better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that
1|things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or
1|other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to
1|whom Napoleon himself did justice--a man whose authority would be
1|willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man."
1|
1|The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always
1|to be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there
1|were particularly many round Alexander--generals and imperial
1|aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a
1|monarch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as
1|Rostov had done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues
1|but all human capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with
1|the sovereign for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for
1|such excessive modesty, and only desired and insisted that their
1|adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce
1|that he would place himself at the head of the army, gather round
1|him a commander in chief's staff, and, consulting experienced
1|theoreticians and practical men where necessary, would himself lead
1|the troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest
1|pitch.
1|
1|The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to
1|the others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither
1|peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa
1|or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor
1|Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing--as much advantage
1|and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of
1|conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor's
1|headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at
1|other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post
1|would today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the
1|day after, merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor,
1|would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who
1|wished to gain some advantage would attract the Emperor's attention by
1|loudly advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day
1|before, and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast
1|and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby
1|proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good.
1|A third, in the absence of opponents, between two councils would
1|simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services, well
1|knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him.
1|A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come
1|accidentally under the Emperor's eye. A fifth, to achieve his
1|long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist
1|on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for
1|this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct.
1|
1|All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations,
1|and promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of
1|imperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction,
1|this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way,
1|so that it was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere.
1|Amid the uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious
1|danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid
1|this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings,
1|and the diversity of race among these people--this eighth and
1|largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted
1|great confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever question
1|arose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their
1|buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum
1|drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly.
1|
1|From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached
1|the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning
1|to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men
1|experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any
1|of those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of
1|what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means
1|of escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.
1|
1|The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong
1|resulted chiefly from the Emperor's presence in the army with his
1|military court and from the consequent presence there of an
1|indefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluctuation of relations,
1|which is in place at court but harmful in an army; that a sovereign
1|should reign but not command the army, and that the only way out of
1|the position would be for the Emperor and his court to leave the army;
1|that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the action of fifty
1|thousand men required to secure his personal safety, and that the
1|worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the
1|very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch.
1|
1|Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,
1|Shishkov, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives
1|of this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakcheev and
1|Balashev agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of
1|permission given him by the Emperor to discuss the general course of
1|affairs, he respectfully suggested--on the plea that it was necessary
1|for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the
1|capital--that the Emperor should leave the army.
1|
1|That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to
1|them to defend their country--the very incitement which was the
1|chief cause of Russia's triumph in so far as it was produced by the
1|Tsar's personal presence in Moscow--was suggested to the Emperor,
1|and accepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the army.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when
1|Barclay, one day at dinner, informed Bolkonski that the sovereign
1|wished to see him personally, to question him about Turkey, and that
1|Prince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen's quarters at six
1|that evening.
1|
1|News was received at the Emperor's quarters that very day of a fresh
1|movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army--news
1|subsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had
1|ridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had
1|pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel,
1|and till then considered a chef-d'oeuvre of tactical science which
1|would ensure Napoleon's destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the
1|destruction of the Russian army.
1|
1|Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen's quarters--a country gentleman's
1|house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river.
1|Neither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernyshev, the
1|Emperor's aide-de-camp, received Bolkonski and informed him that the
1|Emperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had
1|gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the
1|Drissa camp, of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning
1|to be felt.
1|
1|Chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French
1|novel in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was
1|still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one
1|corner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen's adjutant. This
1|adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding,
1|evidently exhausted by work or by feasting. Two doors led from the
1|room, one straight on into what had been the drawing room, and
1|another, on the right, to the study. Through the first door came the
1|sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally in French. In
1|that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor's wish, not a military
1|council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain persons
1|whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending
1|difficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it were, a
1|council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally.
1|To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General Armfeldt,
1|Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had referred
1|to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein who was
1|not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew
1|had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew had
1|an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon
1|after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a
1|minute to speak to Chernyshev.
1|
1|At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,
1|which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince
1|Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about
1|him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German
1|theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more
1|typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German
1|theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united
1|to such an extent.
1|
1|Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust
1|build, broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face
1|was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been
1|hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in
1|quaint little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and
1|angrily around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment.
1|Awkwardly holding up his sword, he addressed Chernyshev and asked in
1|German where the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass
1|through the rooms as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and
1|greetings, and sit down to business in front of a map, where he
1|would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply to Chernyshev, and
1|smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the
1|fortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with his
1|theory. He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice,
1|as self-assured Germans do--it might have been "stupid fellow"... or
1|"the whole affair will be ruined," or "something absurd will come of
1|it."... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed
1|on, but Chernyshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince
1|Andrew was just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so
1|fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced--not so much at Prince Andrew as
1|past him--and said, with a laugh: "That must have been a fine tactical
1|war"; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room from which
1|the sound of voices was heard.
1|
1|Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly
1|disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
1|and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with
1|Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to
1|form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and
1|immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as
1|only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of
1|an abstract notion--science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute
1|truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally,
1|both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An
1|Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized state
1|in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows what he should
1|do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An
1|Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself
1|and other people. A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing
1|and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that
1|anything can be known. The German's self-assurance is worst of all,
1|stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he
1|knows the truth--science--which he himself has invented but which is for
1|him the absolute truth.
1|
1|Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science--the theory of
1|oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the
1|Great's wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent
1|warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous--monstrous collisions in
1|which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars
1|could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and
1|therefore could not serve as material for science.
1|
1|In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of
1|campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstadt, but he did not see the
1|least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of
1|that war. On the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were,
1|in his opinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with
1|characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark, "There, I said the
1|whole affair would go to the devil!" Pfuel was one of those
1|theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the
1|theory's object--its practical application. His love of theory made
1|him hate everything practical, and he would not listen to it. He was
1|even pleased by failures, for failures resulting from deviations in
1|practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his
1|theory.
1|
1|He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about the
1|present war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all
1|will go wrong, and who is not displeased that it should be so. The
1|unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed
1|hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently.
1|
1|He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of
1|his voice were at once heard from there.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew's eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when
1|Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkonski, but not
1|pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as
1|he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened
1|on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.
1|Chernyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the
1|Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was
1|talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head
1|bent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor
1|moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the
1|flushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and
1|continued to speak.
1|
1|"And as for the man who advised forming this camp--the Drissa camp,"
1|said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince
1|Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, "as to that person, sire..."
1|continued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain
1|himself, "the man who advised the Drissa camp--I see no alternative
1|but the lunatic asylum or the gallows!"
1|
1|Without heeding the end of the Italian's remarks, and as though
1|not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkonski, addressed him
1|graciously.
1|
1|"I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting,
1|and wait for me."
1|
1|The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter
1|Mikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind
1|them. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor's permission,
1|accompanied Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing
1|room where the council was assembled.
1|
1|Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position, as it
1|were, of chief of the Emperor's staff. He came out of the study into
1|the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put
1|questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
1|present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to
1|be false) had been received during the night of a movement by the
1|French to outflank the Drissa camp.
1|
1|The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty
1|that presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position
1|away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was
1|inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an
1|opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and
1|there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that
1|plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
1|put--which, in fact, his plan did not answer--as to avail himself of
1|the opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals,
1|one as good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite
1|unknown what character the war would take. Some disputed his
1|arguments, others defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the
1|Swedish general's views more warmly than anyone else, and in the
1|course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled
1|notebook, which he asked permission to read to them. In these
1|voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from
1|Armfeldt's or Pfuel's plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci
1|suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged, could alone
1|extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he
1|called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.
1|
1|During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen
1|(his "bridge" in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted
1|contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean
1|himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when
1|Prince Volkonski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his
1|opinion, he merely said:
1|
1|"Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position
1|with an exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman's attack--very
1|fine, or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?" said he. "Why, you
1|yourselves know everything better than I do."
1|
1|But when Volkonski said, with a frown, that it was in the
1|Emperor's name that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly
1|growing animated, began to speak:
1|
1|"Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody
1|thought they knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How
1|mend matters? There is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me
1|must be strictly adhered to," said he, drumming on the table with
1|his bony fingers. "What is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!"
1|
1|He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
1|eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that
1|everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really
1|going to outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.
1|
1|Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in
1|French. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French
1|badly, and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with
1|Pfuel, who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had
1|happened, but all that could happen, had been foreseen in his
1|scheme, and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault
1|lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed. He kept
1|laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at last contemptuously
1|ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who ceases to prove in
1|various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved.
1|Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in
1|French, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, "Is it not so,
1|your excellency?" But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who
1|strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at his own supporter,
1|Wolzogen:
1|
1|"Well, of course, what more is there to explain?"
1|
1|Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in
1|French. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to
1|Volkonski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.
1|
1|Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,
1|determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those
1|present, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself,
1|nursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan,
1|formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out.
1|He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired
1|involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides
1|this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had
1|not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a
1|panic fear of Napoleon's genius, which, though concealed, was
1|noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible
1|for Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his
1|terrible name to shatter each other's proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to
1|consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his
1|theory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in
1|Prince Andrew. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him
1|and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the
1|Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel's own
1|expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself
1|felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and
1|grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly
1|brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he
1|concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was
1|evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
1|theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole
1|world was slipping away from him.
1|
1|The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted
1|the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and
1|personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
1|conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to
1|this polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and
1|shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought
1|that had long since and often occurred to him during his military
1|activities--the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of
1|war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military
1|genius--now appeared to him an obvious truth. "What theory and science
1|is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which
1|are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the
1|acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to
1|foresee in what condition our or the enemy's armies will be in a day's
1|time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment.
1|Sometimes--when there is not a coward at the front to shout, 'We are
1|cut off!' and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts,
1|'Hurrah!'--a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand,
1|as at Schon Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run from eight
1|thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in
1|which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and
1|everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of
1|which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one
1|knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says
1|we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the
1|worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,
1|and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes
1|one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the
1|advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.
1|And why do they all speak of a 'military genius'? Is a man a genius
1|who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who
1|is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military
1|men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter
1|power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess.
1|The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or
1|absent-minded men. Bagration was the best, Napoleon himself admitted
1|that. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied
1|face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander
1|not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence
1|of the highest and best human attributes--love, poetry, tenderness,
1|and philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly
1|convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will
1|not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave
1|leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity,
1|or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a
1|theory of their 'genius' was invented for them long ago because they
1|have power! The success of a military action depends not on them,
1|but on the man in the ranks who shouts, 'We are lost!' or who
1|shouts, 'Hurrah!' And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance
1|of being useful."
1|
1|So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he
1|roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.
1|
1|At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he
1|would like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court
1|circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign's
1|person, but for permission to serve in the army.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostov had received a letter
1|from his parents in which they told him briefly of Natasha's illness
1|and the breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they
1|explained by Natasha's having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas
1|to retire from the army and return home. On receiving this letter,
1|Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to
1|retire from the army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry
1|Natasha was ill and her engagement broken off, and that he would do
1|all he could to meet their wishes. To Sonya he wrote separately.
1|
1|"Adored friend of my soul!" he wrote. "Nothing but honor could
1|keep me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of
1|the campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades'
1|eyes but in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and
1|duty to the Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe
1|me, directly the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by
1|you, I will throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever
1|to my ardent breast."
1|
1|It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that
1|prevented Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying
1|Sonya. The autumn in Otradnoe with the hunting, and the winter with
1|the Christmas holidays and Sonya's love, had opened out to him a vista
1|of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before,
1|and which now allured him. "A splendid wife, children, a good pack
1|of hounds, a dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors,
1|service by election..." thought he. But now the campaign was
1|beginning, and he had to remain with his regiment. And since it had to
1|be so, Nicholas Rostov, as was natural to him, felt contented with the
1|life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that
1|life.
1|
1|On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully
1|welcomed by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back
1|from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him
1|commendation from his commanders. During his absence he had been
1|promoted captain, and when the regiment was put on war footing with an
1|increase in numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.
1|
1|The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double
1|pay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody
1|was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the
1|commencement of a war, and Rostov, conscious of his advantageous
1|position in the regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures
1|and interests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later
1|he would have to relinquish them.
1|
1|The troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons of
1|state, political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was
1|accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and
1|passions at headquarters. For the Pavlograd hussars, however, the
1|whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with
1|sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business.
1|
1|It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness,
1|and intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves
1|where they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat,
1|it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown
1|accustomed to, or some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that
1|things looked bad chanced to enter anyone's head, he tried to be as
1|cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general
1|trend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand. First they
1|camped gaily before Vilna, making acquaintance with the Polish
1|landowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor
1|and other high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyani
1|and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them.
1|Sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a
1|name the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many
1|complaints were made against the troops, who, taking advantage of
1|the order to collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, and
1|carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostov remembered Sventsyani,
1|because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he
1|changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
1|men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels
1|of old beer. From Sventsyani they retired farther and farther to
1|Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier
1|of Russia proper.
1|
1|On the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a serious
1|action for the first time.
1|
1|On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy
1|storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was
1|remarkable for its storms.
1|
1|The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye,
1|which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by
1|cattle and horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostov,
1|with a young officer named Ilyin, his protege, was sitting in a
1|hastily constructed shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long
1|mustaches extending onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had
1|been overtaken by the rain, entered Rostov's shelter.
1|
1|"I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raevski's
1|exploit?"
1|
1|And the officer gave them details of the Saltanov battle, which he
1|had heard at the staff.
1|
1|Rostov, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water
1|trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional
1|glance at Ilyin, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of
1|sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same
1|relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years
1|before. Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything and adored him
1|as a girl might have done.
1|
1|Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke
1|grandiloquently of the Saltanov dam being "a Russian Thermopylae," and
1|of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General
1|Raevski. He recounted how Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam
1|under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him. Rostov heard
1|the story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski's
1|enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man ashamed of what
1|he was hearing, though with no intention of contradicting it. Since
1|the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that
1|men always lie when describing military exploits, as he himself had
1|done when recounting them; besides that, he had experience enough to
1|know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate
1|it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski's tale, nor did he like
1|Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his
1|cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and
1|crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty. Rostov looked at him in
1|silence. "In the first place, there must have been such a confusion
1|and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did
1|lead his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on
1|some dozen men nearest to him," thought he, "the rest could not have
1|seen how or with whom Raevski came onto the dam. And even those who
1|did see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had
1|they to do with Raevski's tender paternal feelings when their own
1|skins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did
1|not depend on whether they took the Saltanov dam or not, as we are
1|told was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a
1|sacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would
1|not have taken my brother Petya there, or even Ilyin, who's a stranger
1|to me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under
1|cover," Nicholas continued to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But
1|he did not express his thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had
1|gained experience. He knew that this tale redounded to the glory of
1|our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted
1|accordingly.
1|
1|"I can't stand this any more," said Ilyin, noticing that Rostov
1|did not relish Zdrzhinski's conversation. "My stockings and shirt...
1|and the water is running on my seat! I'll go and look for shelter. The
1|rain seems less heavy."
1|
1|Ilyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.
1|
1|Five minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, came running
1|back to the shanty.
1|
1|"Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I've found it! About two hundred
1|yards away there's a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can
1|at least get dry there, and Mary Hendrikhovna's there."
1|
1|Mary Hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty
1|young German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether
1|from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young
1|wife in the early days of their marriage, took her about with him
1|wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a
1|standing joke among the hussar officers.
1|
1|Rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrushka to
1|follow with the things, and--now slipping in the mud, now splashing
1|right through it--set off with Ilyin in the lessening rain and the
1|darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.
1|
1|"Rostov, where are you?"
1|
1|"Here. What lightning!" they called to one another.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|In the tavern, before which stood the doctor's covered cart, there
1|were already some five officers. Mary Hendrikhovna, a plump little
1|blonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a
1|broad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep
1|behind her. Rostov and Ilyin, on entering the room, were welcomed with
1|merry shouts and laughter.
1|
1|"Dear me, how jolly we are!" said Rostov laughing.
1|
1|"And why do you stand there gaping?"
1|
1|"What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don't
1|make our drawing room so wet."
1|
1|"Don't mess Mary Hendrikhovna's dress!" cried other voices.
1|
1|Rostov and Ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change
1|into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendrikhovna's modesty. They
1|were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but
1|found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards
1|by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these
1|officers would on no account yield their position. Mary Hendrikhovna
1|obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and
1|behind that screen Rostov and Ilyin, helped by Lavrushka who had
1|brought their kits, changed their wet things for dry ones.
1|
1|A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was
1|found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small
1|samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and
1|having asked Mary Hendrikhovna to preside, they all crowded round her.
1|One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands,
1|another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the
1|damp, another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft, and
1|yet another waved the flies off her husband's face, lest he should
1|wake up.
1|
1|"Leave him alone," said Mary Hendrikhovna, smiling timidly and
1|happily. "He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night."
1|
1|"Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna," replied the officer, "one must look
1|after the doctor. Perhaps he'll take pity on me someday, when it comes
1|to cutting off a leg or an arm for me."
1|
1|There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one
1|could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar
1|held only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter
1|to take turns in order of seniority to receive one's tumbler from Mary
1|Hendrikhovna's plump little hands with their short and not overclean
1|nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love
1|with her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition
1|soon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the
1|general mood of courting Mary Hendrikhovna. She, seeing herself
1|surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with
1|satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she
1|evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.
1|
1|There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything
1|else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary
1|Hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostov
1|received his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary
1|Hendrikhovna to stir it.
1|
1|"But you take it without sugar?" she said, smiling all the time,
1|as if everything she said and everything the others said was very
1|amusing and had a double meaning.
1|
1|"It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should
1|stir my tea."
1|
1|Mary Hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which
1|someone meanwhile had pounced on.
1|
1|"Use your finger, Mary Hendrikhovna, it will be still nicer," said
1|Rostov.
1|
1|"Too hot!" she replied, blushing with pleasure.
1|
1|Ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it
1|to Mary Hendrikhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.
1|
1|"This is my cup," said he. "Only dip your finger in it and I'll
1|drink it all up."
1|
1|When they had emptied the samovar, Rostov took a pack of cards and
1|proposed that they should play "Kings" with Mary Hendrikhovna. They
1|drew lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostov's suggestion
1|it was agreed that whoever became "King" should have the right to kiss
1|Mary Hendrikhovna's hand, and that the "Booby" should go to refill and
1|reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.
1|
1|"Well, but supposing Mary Hendrikhovna is 'King'?" asked Ilyin.
1|
1|"As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!"
1|
1|They had hardly begun to play before the doctor's disheveled head
1|suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna. He had been awake for
1|some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found
1|nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad
1|and depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and
1|asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon
1|as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter
1|and Mary Hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and
1|thereby became still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard,
1|the doctor told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and
1|looked at him in alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had
1|ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart, or
1|everything in it would be stolen.
1|
1|"But I'll send an orderly.... Two of them!" said Rostov. "What an
1|idea, doctor!"
1|
1|"I'll stand guard on it myself!" said Ilyin.
1|
1|"No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for
1|two nights," replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his
1|wife, waiting for the game to end.

1|Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers
1|grew still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from
1|laughter, for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When
1|he had gone, taking his wife with him, and had settled down with her
1|in their covered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, covering
1|themselves with their wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long
1|time; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the doctor's uneasiness
1|and his wife's delight, now they ran out into the porch and reported
1|what was taking place in the covered trap. Several times Rostov,
1|covering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would
1|arouse him and conversation would be resumed, to the accompaniment
1|of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.

1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|It was nearly three o'clock but no one was yet asleep, when the
1|quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town
1|of Ostrovna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began
1|hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water
1|in the samovar. But Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting
1|for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were
1|dispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in clothes that were
1|still moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn,
1|Rostov and Ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather
1|hood of the doctor's cart, from under the apron of which his feet were
1|sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife's nightcap was
1|visible and her sleepy breathing audible.
1|
1|"She really is a dear little thing," said Rostov to Ilyin, who was
1|following him.
1|
1|"A charming woman!" said Ilyin, with all the gravity of a boy of
1|sixteen.
1|
1|Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The
1|command was heard to "mount" and the soldiers crossed themselves and
1|mounted. Rostov riding in front gave the order "Forward!" and the
1|hussars, with clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses' hoofs
1|splashing in the mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad
1|road planted with birch trees on each side, following the infantry and
1|a battery that had gone on in front.
1|
1|Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding
1|before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly
1|grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly
1|visible, still wet with the night's rain; the drooping branches of the
1|birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of
1|water to one side. The soldiers' faces were more and more clearly
1|visible. Rostov, always closely followed by Ilyin, rode along the side
1|of the road between two rows of birch trees.
1|
1|When campaigning, Rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding
1|not a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a
1|sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome,
1|Donets horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he
1|rode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a
1|pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the
1|doctor's wife, but not once of the impending danger.
1|
1|Formerly, when going into action, Rostov had felt afraid; now he had
1|not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had
1|grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but
1|because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He
1|had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything
1|but what would seem most likely to interest him--the impending danger.
1|During the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as
1|he reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this,
1|but with time it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyin under
1|the birch trees, occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met
1|his hand, sometimes touching his horse's side with his foot, or,
1|without turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar
1|riding behind him, with as calm and careless an air as though he
1|were merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited face
1|of Ilyin, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from
1|experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet
1|was suffering and knew that only time could help him.
1|
1|As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the
1|clouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the
1|summer morning after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but
1|vertically now, and all was still. The whole sun appeared on the
1|horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it.
1|A few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top
1|of the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew bright and
1|glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, came the
1|sound of guns ahead of them.
1|
1|Before Rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of
1|that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy's adjutant came galloping from
1|Vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.
1|
1|The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery--which
1|had also quickened their pace--rode down a hill, and passing through
1|an empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to
1|lather and the men to flush.
1|
1|"Halt! Dress your ranks!" the order of the regimental commander
1|was heard ahead. "Forward by the left. Walk, march!" came the order
1|from in front.
1|
1|And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left
1|flank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the
1|front line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they
1|were the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns
1|were visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated
1|by slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be
1|seen the enemy's columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in
1|action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in
1|the dale.
1|
1|At these sounds, long unheard, Rostov's spirits rose, as at the
1|strains of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots,
1|now together, now several quickly one after another. Again all was
1|silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on
1|detonators and exploding them.
1|
1|The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A
1|cannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the
1|squadron, halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode
1|up the hill to the guns.
1|
1|After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.
1|
1|"Form column! Prepare to charge!"
1|
1|The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the
1|cavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears
1|fluttering, and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was
1|seen below to the left.
1|
1|As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered
1|up the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by
1|the Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but
1|fell spent without taking effect.
1|
1|The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more
1|pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostov than the previous sounds
1|of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening
1|out before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the
1|movement of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French
1|dragoons, something confused happened there amid the smoke, and five
1|minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they
1|had occupied but more to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans
1|on chestnut horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French
1|dragoons on gray horses could be seen.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|Rostov, with his keen sportsman's eye, was one of the first to catch
1|sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and
1|nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons
1|pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small
1|at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving
1|their arms and their sabers in the air.
1|
1|Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He
1|felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons
1|now, the latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be
1|made it must be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too
1|late. He looked around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing
1|like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.
1|
1|"Andrew Sevastyanych!" said Rostov. "You know, we could crush
1|them...."
1|
1|"A fine thing too!" replied the captain, "and really..."
1|
1|Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped
1|to the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish
1|giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling,
1|was following him. Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it.
1|He acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He
1|saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder; he
1|knew they could not withstand an attack--knew there was only that
1|moment and that if he let it slip it would not return. The bullets
1|were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse
1|was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself. He touched
1|his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind
1|him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full
1|trot downhill toward the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the
1|bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a
1|gallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans
1|and the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now
1|close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the foremost began to turn,
1|while those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which
1|he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostov gave rein to his
1|Donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons'
1|disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung
1|himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless
1|horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were
1|galloping back. Rostov, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed
1|after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared
1|it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that
1|he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That
1|Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching
1|on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another moment
1|Rostov's horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the
1|officer's horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant
1|Rostov, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman
1|with it.
1|
1|The instant he had done this, all Rostov's animation vanished. The
1|officer fell, not so much from the blow--which had but slightly cut
1|his arm above the elbow--as from the shock to his horse and from
1|fright. Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see
1|whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with
1|one foot on the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His
1|eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another
1|blow, gazed up at Rostov with shrinking terror. His pale and
1|mud-stained face--fair and young, with a dimple in the chin and
1|light-blue eyes--was not an enemy's face at all suited to a
1|battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostov had
1|decided what to do with him, the officer cried, "I surrender!" He
1|hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and
1|did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostov's face. Some
1|hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
1|saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was
1|wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his
1|horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round
1|him; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In
1|front, the French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars
1|galloped hastily back with their prisoners. Rostov galloped back
1|with the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his
1|heart. Something vague and confused, which he could not at all account
1|for, had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow
1|he had dealt him.
1|
1|Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, sent for
1|Rostov, thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to
1|the Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George's Cross. When
1|sent for by Count Ostermann, Rostov, remembering that he had charged
1|without orders, felt sure his commander was sending for him to
1|punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann's flattering words
1|and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the
1|more pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable
1|feeling of moral nausea. "But what on earth is worrying me?" he
1|asked himself as he rode back from the general. "Ilyin? No, he's safe.
1|Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that's not it." Something
1|else, resembling remorse, tormented him. "Yes, oh yes, that French
1|officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I
1|raised it."
1|
1|Rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to
1|have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was
1|sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked
1|anxiously about him; The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called
1|a wound. He glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and waved his
1|hand in greeting. Rostov still had the same indefinite feeling, as
1|of shame.
1|
1|All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that
1|Rostov, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and
1|preoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept
1|turning something over in his mind.
1|
1|Rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which
1|to his amazement had gained him the St. George's Cross and even given
1|him a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at
1|all understand. "So others are even more afraid than I am!" he
1|thought. "So that's all there is in what is called heroism! And did I
1|do it for my country's sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple
1|and blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should
1|kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given
1|me a St. George's Cross.... I can't make it out at all."
1|
1|But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could
1|reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune
1|in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the
1|affair at Ostrovna he was brought into notice, received command of
1|an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was
1|chosen.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|On receiving news of Natasha's illness, the countess, though not
1|quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Petya and the
1|rest of the household, and the whole family moved from Marya
1|Dmitrievna's house to their own and settled down in town.
1|
1|Natasha's illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for
1|her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her
1|conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the
1|background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
1|in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat
1|or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them
1|feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to
1|help her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked
1|much in French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and
1|prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known
1|to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they
1|could not know the disease Natasha was suffering from, as no disease
1|suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his
1|own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel,
1|complicated disease, unknown to medicine--not a disease of the
1|lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical
1|books, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations
1|of the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur
1|to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to
1|work his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure,
1|and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their
1|lives on that business. But, above all, that thought was kept out of
1|their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful, as in
1|fact they were to the whole Rostov family. Their usefulness did not
1|depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part
1|harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they were given in
1|small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and indispensable
1|because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who
1|loved her--and that is why there are, and always will be,
1|pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They
1|satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy,
1|and that something should be done, which is felt by those who are
1|suffering. They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in
1|a child, when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A
1|child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or
1|nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better
1|when this is done. The child cannot believe that the strongest and
1|wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain, and the hope of
1|relief and the expression of its mother's sympathy while she rubs
1|the bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to Natasha because
1|they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon
1|pass if only the coachman went to the chemist's in the Arbat and got a
1|powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks,
1|and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of
1|precisely two hours, neither more nor less.
1|
1|What would Sonya and the count and countess have done, how would
1|they have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been
1|those pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken
1|cutlets, and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors, the
1|carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the
1|family circle? How would the count have borne his dearly loved
1|daughter's illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand
1|rubles, and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her, or
1|had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet
1|other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there, and
1|had he not been able to explain the details of how Metivier and Feller
1|had not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and Mudrov had
1|diagnosed them even better? What would the countess have done had
1|she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly
1|obeying the doctor's orders?
1|
1|"You'll never get well like that," she would say, forgetting her
1|grief in her vexation, "if you won't obey the doctor and take your
1|medicine at the right time! You mustn't trifle with it, you know, or
1|it may turn to pneumonia," she would go on, deriving much comfort from
1|the utterance of that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well
1|as to herself.
1|
1|What would Sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she
1|had not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be
1|ready to carry out all the doctor's injunctions with precision, and
1|that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time
1|when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be
1|administered? Even to Natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so
1|many sacrifices were being made for her sake, and to know that she had
1|to take medicine at certain hours, though she declared that no
1|medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was
1|even pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that she
1|did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life.
1|
1|The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and
1|regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he
1|had gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed
1|him, he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said
1|that though there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this
1|last medicine and one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly
1|mental, but... And the countess, trying to conceal the action from
1|herself and from him, slipped a gold coin into his hand and always
1|returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind.
1|
1|The symptoms of Natasha's illness were that she ate little, slept
1|little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that
1|she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in
1|the stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostovs did not move to
1|the country that summer of 1812.
1|
1|In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders
1|out of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was
1|fond of such things made a large collection, and in spite of being
1|deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed, youth
1|prevailed. Natasha's grief began to be overlaid by the impressions
1|of daily life, it ceased to press so painfully on her heart, it
1|gradually faded into the past, and she began to recover physically.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|Natasha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external
1|forms of pleasure--balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters--but she
1|never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not
1|sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself,
1|tears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those
1|pure times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should
1|so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so
1|happy. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a
1|blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint,
1|no wish to coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that
1|time that no man was more to her than Nastasya Ivanovna, the buffoon.
1|Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy.
1|Besides, she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish
1|life that had been so full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting,
1|"Uncle," and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otradnoe
1|were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully. What would she not
1|have given to bring back even a single day of that time! But it was
1|gone forever. Her presentiment at the time had not deceived her--that
1|that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return
1|again. Yet it was necessary to live on.
1|
1|It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had
1|formerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the
1|world. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself,
1|"What next?" But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in
1|life, yet life was passing. Natasha apparently tried not to be a
1|burden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She
1|kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her
1|brother Petya. She liked to be with him better than with the others,
1|and when alone with him she sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left
1|the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one
1|person, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her with more
1|delicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously than did
1|Count Bezukhov. Natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so
1|found great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful
1|to him for it; nothing good on Pierre's part seemed to her to be an
1|effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there
1|was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha noticed
1|embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,
1|especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared
1|that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her.
1|She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and
1|shyness, which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was
1|to her. After those involuntary words--that if he were free he would
1|have asked on his knees for her hand and her love--uttered at a moment
1|when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natasha of
1|his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had
1|then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words
1|are spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because Pierre was
1|a married man, but because Natasha felt very strongly with him that
1|moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kuragin
1|that it never entered her head that the relations between him and
1|herself could lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even
1|to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a
1|man and a woman of which she had known several instances.
1|
1|Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agrafena Ivanovna Belova, a
1|country neighbor of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions
1|at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natasha should
1|fast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha gladly welcomed the
1|idea. Despite the doctor's orders that she should not go out early
1|in the morning, Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the
1|sacrament, not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov
1|family by attending three services in their own house, but as Agrafena
1|Ivanovna did, by going to church every day for a week and not once
1|missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.
1|
1|The countess was pleased with Natasha's zeal; after the poor results
1|of the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that
1|prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not
1|without fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to
1|Natasha's wish and entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena Ivanovna used
1|to come to wake Natasha at three in the morning, but generally found
1|her already awake. She was afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily
1|washing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old
1|mantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh air, went out into the
1|deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By Agrafena
1|Ivanovna's advice Natasha prepared herself not in their own parish,
1|but at a church where, according to the devout Agrafena Ivanovna,
1|the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never
1|many people in the church; Natasha always stood beside Belova in the
1|customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the
1|screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her,
1|of humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her
1|when at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the
1|Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning
1|light falling from the window, she listened to the words of the
1|service which she tried to follow with understanding. When she
1|understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the
1|prayers with shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was
1|sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is
1|pride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is only
1|necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt
1|guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and
1|when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply
1|asked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy upon
1|her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were
1|those of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met
1|no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and
1|everybody within the houses was still asleep, Natasha experienced a
1|feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her
1|faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of happiness.
1|
1|During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every
1|day. And the happiness of taking communion, or "communing" as Agrafena
1|Ivanovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natasha
1|so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.
1|
1|But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when,
1|dressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the
1|first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the
1|thought of the life that lay before her.
1|
1|The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue
1|the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.
1|
1|"She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening," said he,
1|evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. "Only, please be
1|particular about it.
1|
1|"Be quite easy," he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the
1|gold coin in his palm. "She will soon be singing and frolicking about.
1|The last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has
1|freshened up very much."
1|
1|The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at
1|her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing
1|room.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the
1|war began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the
1|Emperor to the people, and of his coming himself from the army to
1|Moscow. And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had
1|been received, exaggerated reports became current about them and about
1|the position of Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the
1|army because it was in danger, it was said that Smolensk had
1|surrendered, that Napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle
1|could save Russia.
1|
1|On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was
1|received but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the
1|Rostovs', promised to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a
1|copy of the manifesto and appeal, which he would obtain from Count
1|Rostopchin.
1|
1|That Sunday, the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskis' private
1|chapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o'clock, when
1|the Rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air,
1|the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the
1|crowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of
1|the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the
1|rattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot
1|sunshine were all full of that summer languor, that content and
1|discontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a
1|bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rostovs'
1|acquaintances, were at the Razumovskis' chapel, for, as if expecting
1|something to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for
1|their country estates had not gone away that summer. As Natasha, at
1|her mother's side, passed through the crowd behind a liveried
1|footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a young man speaking
1|about her in too loud a whisper.
1|
1|"That's Rostova, the one who..."
1|
1|"She's much thinner, but all the same she's pretty!"
1|
1|She heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kuragin and Bolkonski.
1|But she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that
1|everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to
1|her. With a sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she
1|found herself in a crowd, Natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with
1|black lace walked--as women can walk--with the more repose and
1|stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for
1|certain that she was pretty, but this no longer gave her
1|satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it tormented her more than
1|anything else of late, and particularly so on this bright, hot
1|summer day in town. "It's Sunday again--another week past," she
1|thought, recalling that she had been here the Sunday before, "and
1|always the same life that is no life, and the same surroundings in
1|which it used to be so easy to live. I'm pretty, I'm young, and I know
1|that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I know I am good," she
1|thought, "but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to
1|anyone." She stood by her mother's side and exchanged nods with
1|acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies'
1|dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not
1|crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she
1|thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was
1|judging others, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt
1|horrified at her own vileness, horrified that the former purity of her
1|soul was again lost to her.
1|
1|A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that
1|mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the
1|souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were
1|closed, the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft
1|mysterious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which
1|she herself did not understand, made Natasha's breast heave, and a
1|joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.
1|
1|"Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good
1|forever, forever!" she pleaded.
1|
1|The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen
1|and, holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his
1|dalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a
1|loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer...
1|
1|"In peace let us pray unto the Lord."
1|
1|"As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity,
1|united by brotherly love--let us pray!" thought Natasha.
1|
1|"For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our
1|souls."
1|
1|"For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,"
1|prayed Natasha.
1|
1|When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and
1|Denisov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she
1|remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her
1|all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love
1|us, she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and
1|mother and Sonya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had
1|acted toward them, and feeling all the strength of her love for
1|them. When they prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of
1|her enemies and people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She
1|included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business
1|dealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies and
1|those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much
1|harm--and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as
1|for an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and
1|calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were
1|as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed
1|for the Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the
1|sign of the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not
1|understand, still she could not doubt, and at any rate loved the
1|governing Synod and prayed for it.
1|
1|When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over
1|his breast and said, "Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to
1|Christ the Lord!"
1|
1|"Commit ourselves to God," Natasha inwardly repeated. "Lord God, I
1|submit myself to Thy will!" she thought. "I want nothing, wish for
1|nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take
1|me!" prayed Natasha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing
1|herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
1|invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from
1|herself, from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.
1|
1|The countess looked round several times at her daughter's softened
1|face and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.
1|
1|Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual
1|order Natasha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool,
1|the one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it
1|before the doors of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his
1|purple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down
1|with an effort. Everybody followed his example and they looked at
1|one another in surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the
1|Synod--a prayer for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.
1|
1|"Lord God of might, God of our salvation!" began the priest in
1|that voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the
1|Slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.
1|
1|"Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and
1|blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and
1|have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay
1|waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are
1|gathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear
1|Jerusalem, Thy beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow
1|Thine altars, and to desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how
1|long shall the wicked triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful
1|power?
1|
1|"Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might
1|our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pavlovich;
1|be mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to
1|his righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless
1|his counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom
1|by Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as
1|Thou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and
1|David over Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands
1|of those who have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins
1|with strength for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to
1|help us; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against
1|us, may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust
1|before the wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them
1|to flight; may they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the
1|plots they have laid in secret be turned against them; let them fall
1|before Thy servants' feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art
1|able to save both great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot
1|prevail against Thee!
1|
1|"God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and
1|loving-kindness which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us,
1|but be gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy
1|many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities! Create in
1|us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us, strengthen us all
1|in Thy faith, fortify our hope, inspire us with true love one for
1|another, arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the
1|heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers, and let not the scepter
1|of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast
1|sanctified.
1|
1|"O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust,
1|let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token
1|of Thy blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see
1|it and be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that
1|Thou art the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this
1|day, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy
1|servants to rejoice in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy
1|them swiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art
1|the defense, the succor, and the victory of them that put their
1|trust in Thee, and to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and Holy
1|Ghost, now and forever, world without end. Amen."
1|
1|In Natasha's receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
1|strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over
1|Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about
1|the destruction of "Thy Jerusalem," and she prayed to God with the
1|tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but
1|without fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer.
1|She shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of
1|righteousness, for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope,
1|and its animation by love. But she could not pray that her enemies
1|might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had
1|been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them. But
1|neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being
1|read on bended knees. She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe
1|at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins,
1|and especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God to forgive
1|them all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace and
1|happiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs' with
1|Natasha's grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that
1|seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was
1|appearing on his own horizon--from that day the problem of the
1|vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly
1|tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question
1|"Why?" "Wherefore?" which had come to him amid every occupation, was
1|now replaced, not by another question or by a reply to the former
1|question, but by her image. When he listened to, or himself took
1|part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human
1|baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask
1|himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
1|transient and incomprehensible--but he remembered her as he had last
1|seen her, and all his doubts vanished--not because she had answered
1|the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of
1|her transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of
1|spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty--a
1|realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever
1|worldly baseness presented itself to him, he said to himself:
1|
1|"Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar, and the
1|country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter?
1|She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her,
1|and no one will ever know it." And his soul felt calm and peaceful.
1|
1|Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same
1|idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the
1|Rostovs' there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the
1|habits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that
1|bore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more
1|disquieting reports came from the seat of war and Natasha's health
1|began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling
1|of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not
1|explain, took possession of him. He felt that the condition he was
1|in could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which
1|would change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere
1|for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons
1|had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon,
1|drawn from the Revelation of St. John.
1|
1|In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:
1|
1|
1|Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
1|of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
1|hundred threescore and six.
1|
1|And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:
1|
1|
1|And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
1|blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
1|months.
1|
1|
1|The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as
1|the Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the
1|others tens, will have the following significance:
1|
1|      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k
1|      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
1|       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s
1|      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90
1|             t    u    v    w    x    y
1|            100  110  120  130  140  150
1|                        z
1|                       160
1|
1|
1|Writing the words L'Empereur Napoleon in numbers, it appears that the
1|sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
1|in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words
1|quarante-deux,* which was the term allowed to the beast that "spoke
1|great things and blasphemies," the same number 666 was obtained; from
1|which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon's power had come
1|in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy
1|pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
1|end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the
1|same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
1|answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words
1|L'Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but
1|the sums were either more or less than 666. Once when making such
1|calculations he wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre
1|Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he
1|changed the spelling, substituting a z for the s and adding de and the
1|article le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then it
1|occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in his
1|name, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wrote
1|Le russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five
1|too much, and five was represented by e, the very letter elided from
1|the article le before the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though
1|incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L'russe Besuhof made
1|666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was
1|connected with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not
1|know, but he did not doubt that connection for a moment. His love for
1|Natasha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the comet, 666,
1|L'Empereur Napoleon, and L'russe Besuhof--all this had to mature and
1|culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow
1|habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great
1|achievement and great happiness.
1|
1|
1|*Forty-two.
1|
1|
1|On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre
1|had promised the Rostovs to bring them, from Count Rostopchin whom
1|he knew well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the
1|army. In the morning, when he went to call at Rostopchin's he met
1|there a courier fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who
1|often danced at Moscow balls.
1|
1|"Do, please, for heaven's sake, relieve me of something!" said the
1|courier. "I have a sackful of letters to parents."
1|
1|Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostov to his father.
1|Pierre took that letter, and Rostopchin also gave him the Emperor's
1|appeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders,
1|and his own most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders,
1|Pierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and
1|rewarded, the name of Nicholas Rostov, awarded a St. George's Cross of
1|the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostrovna affair, and in
1|the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolkonski, appointed to the
1|command of a regiment of Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind
1|the Rostovs of Bolkonski, Pierre could not refrain from making them
1|happy by the news of their son's having received a decoration, so he
1|sent that printed army order and Nicholas' letter to the Rostovs,
1|keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other orders to take with
1|him when he went to dinner.
1|
1|His conversation with Count Rostopchin and the latter's tone of
1|anxious hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how
1|badly things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of
1|spies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that
1|Napoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn,
1|and the talk of the Emperor's being expected to arrive next day--all
1|aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation
1|in Pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance
1|of the comet, and especially since the beginning of the war.
1|
1|He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done
1|so had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society
1|of Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached
1|perpetual peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact
1|that when he saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform
1|and were talking patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step.
1|But the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the
1|army lay in the vague idea that he was L'russe Besuhof who had the
1|number of the beast, 666; that his part in the great affair of setting
1|a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous
1|things had been predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought
1|not to undertake anything, but wait for what was bound to come to
1|pass.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostovs that day, as
1|usual on Sundays.
1|
1|Pierre came early so as to find them alone.
1|
1|He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had
1|he not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried
1|his bulk with evident ease.
1|
1|He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman
1|did not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his
1|master was at the Rostovs' he stayed till midnight. The Rostovs'
1|footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take
1|his hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and
1|stick in the anteroom.
1|
1|The first person he saw in the house was Natasha. Even before he saw
1|her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing
1|solfa exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since
1|her illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted
1|him. He opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had
1|worn at church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to
1|him when he opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his
1|broad, surprised face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.
1|
1|"I want to try to sing again," she said, adding as if by way of
1|excuse, "it is, at least, something to do."
1|
1|"That's capital!"
1|
1|"How glad I am you've come! I am so happy today," she said, with the
1|old animation Pierre had not seen in her for along time. "You know
1|Nicholas has received a St. George's Cross? I am so proud of him."
1|
1|"Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don't want to interrupt
1|you," he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.
1|
1|Natasha stopped him.
1|
1|"Count, is it wrong of me to sing?" she said blushing, and fixing
1|her eyes inquiringly on him.
1|
1|"No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?"
1|
1|"I don't know myself," Natasha answered quickly, "but I should not
1|like to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely.
1|You don't know how important you are to me, how much you've done for
1|me...." She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her
1|words. "I saw in that same army order that he, Bolkonski" (she
1|whispered the name hastily), "is in Russia, and in the army again.
1|What do you think?"--she was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid
1|her strength might fail her--"Will he ever forgive me? Will he not
1|always have a bitter feeling toward me? What do you think? What do you
1|think?"
1|
1|"I think..." Pierre replied, "that he has nothing to forgive....
1|If I were in his place..."
1|
1|By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the
1|day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not
1|himself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his
1|knees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love
1|took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she
1|did not give him time to say them.
1|
1|"Yes, you... you..." she said, uttering the word you
1|rapturously--"that's a different thing. I know no one kinder, more
1|generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there
1|then, and now too, I don't know what would have become of me,
1|because..."
1|
1|Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music
1|before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and
1|down the room.
1|
1|Just then Petya came running in from the drawing room.
1|
1|Petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips
1|and resembled Natasha. He was preparing to enter the university, but
1|he and his friend Obolenski had lately, in secret, agreed to join
1|the hussars.
1|
1|Petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this
1|affair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted
1|in the hussars.
1|
1|Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what
1|Petya was saying.
1|
1|Petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.
1|
1|"Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirilych, for heaven's sake! You
1|are my only hope," said Petya.
1|
1|"Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I'll mention it, I'll bring
1|it all up today."
1|
1|"Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?" asked the old count.
1|"The countess has been to Mass at the Razumovskis' and heard the new
1|prayer. She says it's very fine."
1|
1|"Yes, I've got it," said Pierre. "The Emperor is to be here
1|tomorrow... there's to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility,
1|and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me
1|congratulate you!"
1|
1|"Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?"
1|
1|"We are again retreating. They say we're already near Smolensk,"
1|replied Pierre.
1|
1|"O Lord, O Lord!" exclaimed the count. "Where is the manifesto?"
1|
1|"The Emperor's appeal? Oh yes!"
1|
1|Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not
1|find them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the
1|countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently
1|expecting Natasha, who had left off singing but had not yet come
1|into the drawing room.
1|
1|"On my word, I don't know what I've done with it," he said.
1|
1|"There he is, always losing everything!" remarked the countess.
1|
1|Natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face
1|and sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered,
1|Pierre's features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and
1|while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.
1|
1|"No, really! I'll drive home, I must have left them there. I'll
1|certainly..."
1|
1|"But you'll be late for dinner."
1|
1|"Oh! And my coachman has gone."
1|
1|But Sonya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom,
1|had found them in Pierre's hat, where he had carefully tucked them
1|under the lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.
1|
1|"No, after dinner," said the old count, evidently expecting much
1|enjoyment from that reading.
1|
1|At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new
1|chevalier of St. George, Shinshin told them the town news, of the
1|illness of the old Georgian princess, of Metivier's disappearance from
1|Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchin
1|and accused of being a French "spyer" (so Count Rostopchin had told
1|the story), and how Rostopchin let him go and assured the people
1|that he was "not a spire at all, but only an old German ruin."
1|
1|"People are being arrested..." said the count. "I've told the
1|countess she should not speak French so much. It's not the time for it
1|now."
1|
1|"And have you heard?" Shinshin asked. "Prince Golitsyn has engaged a
1|master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak
1|French in the streets."
1|
1|"And how about you, Count Peter Kirilych? If they call up the
1|militia, you too will have to mount a horse," remarked the old
1|count, addressing Pierre.
1|
1|Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming
1|not to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.
1|
1|"Oh yes, the war," he said. "No! What sort of warrior should I make?
1|And yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can't make it out. I
1|don't know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these
1|times no one can answer for himself."
1|
1|After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy
1|chair and with a serious face asked Sonya, who was considered an
1|excellent reader, to read the appeal.
1|
1|
1|"To Moscow, our ancient Capital!
1|
1|"The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He
1|comes to despoil our beloved country."
1|
1|
1|Sonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count
1|listened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.
1|
1|Natasha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father
1|and now at Pierre.
1|
1|Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The
1|countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn
1|expression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that
1|the danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshin,
1|with a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make
1|fun of anything that gave him the opportunity: Sonya's reading, any
1|remark of the count's, or even the manifesto itself should no better
1|pretext present itself.
1|
1|After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes
1|the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious
1|nobility, Sonya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the
1|attention that was being paid to her, read the last words:
1|
1|
1|"We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that
1|Capital and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the
1|direction of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy's path
1|and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the
1|ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may
1|Europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia!"
1|
1|
1|"Yes, that's it!" cried the count, opening his moist eyes and
1|sniffing repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his
1|nose; and he added, "Let the Emperor but say the word and we'll
1|sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing."
1|
1|Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on
1|the count's patriotism, Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to
1|her father.
1|
1|"What a darling our Papa is!" she cried, kissing him, and she
1|again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned
1|to her with her better spirits.
1|
1|"There! Here's a patriot for you!" said Shinshin.
1|
1|"Not a patriot at all, but simply..." Natasha replied in an
1|injured tone. "Everything seems funny to you, but this isn't at all
1|a joke...."
1|
1|"A joke indeed!" put in the count. "Let him but say the word and
1|we'll all go.... We're not Germans!"
1|
1|"But did you notice, it says, 'for consultation'?" said Pierre.
1|
1|"Never mind what it's for...."
1|
1|At this moment, Petya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came
1|up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking
1|voice that was now deep and now shrill:
1|
1|"Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it's as you
1|please, but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army,
1|because I can't... that's all...."
1|
1|The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and
1|turned angrily to her husband.
1|
1|"That comes of your talking!" said she.
1|
1|But the count had already recovered from his excitement.
1|
1|"Come, come!" said he. "Here's a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You
1|must study."
1|
1|"It's not nonsense, Papa. Fedya Obolenski is younger than I, and
1|he's going too. Besides, all the same I can't study now when..." Petya
1|stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,
1|"when our Fatherland is in danger."
1|
1|"That'll do, that'll do--nonsense...."
1|
1|"But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything."
1|
1|"Petya! Be quiet, I tell you!" cried the count, with a glance at his
1|wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.
1|
1|"And I tell you--Peter Kirilych here will also tell you..."
1|
1|"Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother's milk has hardly dried on your
1|lips and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,"
1|and the count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably
1|to reread them in his study before having a nap.
1|
1|"Well, Peter Kirilych, let's go and have a smoke," he said.
1|
1|Pierre was agitated and undecided. Natasha's unwontedly brilliant
1|eyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had
1|reduced him to this condition.
1|
1|"No, I think I'll go home."
1|
1|"Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don't
1|often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine," said the count
1|good-naturedly, pointing to Natasha, "only brightens up when you're
1|here."
1|
1|"Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business..."
1|said Pierre hurriedly.
1|
1|"Well, then, au revoir!" said the count, and went out of the room.
1|
1|"Why are you going? Why are you upset?" asked Natasha, and she
1|looked challengingly into Pierre's eyes.
1|
1|"Because I love you!" was what he wanted to say, but he did not
1|say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.
1|
1|"Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No,
1|simply I have business...."
1|
1|"Why? No, tell me!" Natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.
1|
1|They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He
1|tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he
1|silently kissed her hand and went out.
1|
1|Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostovs' any more.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|After the definite refusal he had received, Petya went to his room
1|and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,
1|silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to
1|notice anything.
1|
1|Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostovs'
1|domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That
1|morning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar
1|to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,
1|gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word
1|to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to
1|avoid notice. Petya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and
1|to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor
1|to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostov,
1|in spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be
1|no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing,
1|Petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the
1|gentleman-in-waiting.
1|
1|It was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted for
1|success in reaching the Emperor--he even thought how surprised
1|everyone would be at his youthfulness--and yet in the arrangement of
1|his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to
1|appear a grown-up man. But the farther he went and the more his
1|attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the
1|Kremlin, the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and
1|deliberation of a man. As he approached the Kremlin he even began to
1|avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a
1|menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to
1|the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic
1|intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
1|determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,
1|rumbling beneath the archway. Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a
1|footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing
1|some time in the gateway, Petya tried to move forward in front of
1|the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began
1|resolutely working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in
1|front of him, who was the first against whom he directed his
1|efforts, angrily shouted at him:
1|
1|"What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don't you see we're all
1|standing still? Then why push?"
1|
1|"Anybody can shove," said the footman, and also began working his
1|elbows to such effect that he pushed Petya into a very filthy corner
1|of the gateway.
1|
1|Petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the
1|damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a
1|man's.
1|
1|He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if
1|he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he
1|would not be admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten
1|oneself up or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of
1|the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostovs', and
1|Petya thought of asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that
1|would not be a manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed
1|in, the crowd, carrying Petya with it, streamed forward into the
1|Kremlin Square which was already full of people. There were people not
1|only in the square, but everywhere--on the slopes and on the roofs. As
1|soon as Petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound
1|of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole
1|Kremlin.
1|
1|For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were
1|bared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Petya was being
1|pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted,
1|"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and
1|pinched, but could see nothing except the people about him.
1|
1|All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm.
1|A tradesman's wife standing beside Petya sobbed, and the tears ran
1|down her cheeks.
1|
1|"Father! Angel! Dear one!" she kept repeating, wiping away her tears
1|with her fingers.
1|
1|"Hurrah!" was heard on all sides.
1|
1|For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush
1|forward.
1|
1|Quite beside himself, Petya, clinching his teeth and rolling his
1|eyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting
1|"hurrah!" as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and
1|everyone else, but on both sides of him other people with similarly
1|ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted "hurrah!"
1|
1|"So this is what the Emperor is!" thought Petya. "No, I can't
1|petition him myself--that would be too bold." But in spite of this
1|he continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the
1|backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a
1|strip of red cloth spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed
1|back--the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed
1|too close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace
1|to the Cathedral of the Assumption--and Petya unexpectedly received
1|such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that
1|suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost
1|consciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance
1|with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a
1|shabby blue cassock--probably a church clerk and chanter--was
1|holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure
1|of the crowd with the other.
1|
1|"You've crushed the young gentleman!" said the clerk. "What are
1|you up to? Gently!... They've crushed him, crushed him!"
1|
1|The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd
1|spread out again more evenly, and the clerk led Petya--pale and
1|breathless--to the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Petya,
1|and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those
1|who stood nearest him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him
1|on the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached those others
1|(whoever they might be) who had crushed him.
1|
1|"One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it?
1|Killing people! Poor dear, he's as white as a sheet!"--various
1|voices were heard saying.
1|
1|Petya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain
1|had passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had
1|obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the
1|Emperor who would be returning that way. Petya no longer thought of
1|presenting his petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would
1|be happy!
1|
1|While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the
1|Assumption--it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the
1|Emperor's arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with
1|the Turks--the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling
1|kvas, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Petya was
1|particularly fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A
1|tradesman's wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much
1|the shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got
1|dear. The clerk who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary
1|about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop. The
1|clerk several times used the word "plenary" (of the service), a word
1|Petya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking with some
1|serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these conversations, especially
1|the joking with the girls, were such as might have had a particular
1|charm for Petya at his age, but they did not interest him now. He sat
1|on his elevation--the pedestal of the cannon--still agitated as before
1|by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him. The feeling of
1|pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed, together
1|with that of rapture, still further intensified his sense of the
1|importance of the occasion.
1|
1|Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the
1|embankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and
1|the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the
1|firing. Petya too would have run there, but the clerk who had taken
1|the young gentleman under his protection stopped him. The firing was
1|still proceeding when officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting
1|came running out of the cathedral, and after them others in a more
1|leisurely manner: caps were again raised, and those who had run to
1|look at the cannon ran back again. At last four men in uniforms and
1|sashes emerged from the cathedral doors. "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the
1|crowd again.
1|
1|"Which is he? Which?" asked Petya in a tearful voice, of those around
1|him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Petya,
1|fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the
1|tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm on
1|him--though it happened not to be the Emperor--frantically shouted
1|"Hurrah!" and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join
1|the army.
1|
1|The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and
1|began to disperse. It was already late, and Petya had not eaten
1|anything and was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home
1|but stood with that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd
1|before the palace while the Emperor dined--looking in at the palace
1|windows, expecting he knew not what, and envying alike the notables he
1|saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court
1|footmen who served at table, glimpses of whom could be seen through
1|the windows.
1|
1|While the Emperor was dining, Valuev, looking out of the window,
1|said:
1|
1|"The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again."
1|
1|The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit,
1|rose and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Petya among them,
1|rushed toward the balcony.
1|
1|"Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!..." cried the crowd, and Petya
1|with it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Petya among them,
1|wept with joy.
1|
1|A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand
1|broke off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A
1|coachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched
1|it up. Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this
1|the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began
1|throwing them down from the balcony. Petya's eyes grew bloodshot,
1|and still more excited by the danger of being crushed, he rushed at
1|the biscuits. He did not know why, but he had to have a biscuit from
1|the Tsar's hand and he felt that he must not give way. He sprang
1|forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit; the
1|old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on
1|the ground--she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach
1|them. Petya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a biscuit,
1|and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted "Hurrah!" with a voice
1|already hoarse.
1|
1|The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd
1|began to disperse.
1|
1|"There! I said if only we waited--and so it was!" was being joyfully
1|said by various people.
1|
1|Happy as Petya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that
1|all the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home
1|from the Kremlin, but called on his friend Obolenski, who was
1|fifteen and was also entering the regiment. On returning home Petya
1|announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter
1|the service he would run away. And next day, Count Ilya Rostov--though
1|he had not yet quite yielded--went to inquire how he could arrange for
1|Petya to serve where there would be least danger.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of
1|carriages were standing outside the Sloboda Palace.
1|
1|The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry
1|in their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted
1|coats of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen's hall there
1|was an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat
1|on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the
1|Emperor, but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.
1|
1|All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in
1|their own houses, were in uniform--some in that of Catherine's day,
1|others in that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of
1|Alexander's time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the
1|general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something
1|strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities,
1|both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow,
1|and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially striking. For
1|the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, or, if
1|they walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone
1|younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Petya had
1|seen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the general
1|expectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the everyday
1|interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zinaida Dmitrievna's
1|health, and so on.
1|
1|Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman's
1|uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated; this
1|extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the
1|merchant-class--les etats generaux (States-General)--evoked in him a
1|whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply
1|graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat social and the French
1|Revolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor's
1|appeal--that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation
1|with his people--strengthened this idea. And imagining that in this
1|direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing
1|near, he strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but
1|nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.
1|
1|The Emperor's manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all
1|moved about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of
1|conversation, Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the
1|nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered, when a ball should be
1|given in the Emperor's honor, whether they should group themselves
1|by districts or by whole provinces... and so on; but as soon as the
1|war was touched on, or what the nobility had been convened for, the
1|talk became undecided and indefinite. Then all preferred listening
1|to speaking.
1|
1|A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a
1|retired naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small
1|crowd was pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had
1|formed round the speaker and listened. Count Ilya Rostov, in a
1|military uniform of Catherine's time, was sauntering with a pleasant
1|smile among the crowd, with all of whom he was acquainted. He too
1|approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of
1|approval, as he always did, to what the speaker was saying. The
1|retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was evident from the
1|expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some
1|people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away
1|disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his
1|way into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that
1|the man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from his
1|own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical,
1|and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing his r's and
1|generally slurring his consonants: the voice of a man calling out to
1|his servant, "Heah! Bwing me my pipe!" It was indicative of
1|dissipation and the exercise of authority.
1|
1|"What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the
1|Empewah? Ah we to take Smolensk as our patte'n? If the noble
1|awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its
1|loyalty to our sov'weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we
1|fo'gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah 'seven? All that
1|did was to enwich the pwiests' sons and thieves and wobbahs...."
1|
1|Count Ilya Rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval.
1|
1|"And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only
1|wuined our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o' ou' men
1|will wetu'n neithah soldiers no' peasants, and we'll get only
1|depwavity fwom them. The nobility don't gwudge theah lives--evewy
1|one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and the sov'weign" (that
1|was the way he referred to the Emperor) "need only say the word and
1|we'll all die fo' him!" added the orator with animation.
1|
1|Count Rostov's mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but
1|Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,
1|but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had
1|he opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in
1|his head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the
1|first speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing
1|debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct
1|tones:
1|
1|"I imagine, sir," said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth,
1|"that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it's best
1|for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to
1|call out the militia. We have been summoned to reply to the appeal
1|with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what
1|is best--conscription or the militia--we can leave to the supreme
1|authority...."
1|
1|Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his
1|heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow
1|attitude into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped
1|forward and interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would
1|say, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French
1|or expressing himself in bookish Russian.
1|
1|"Excuse me, your excellency," he began. (He was well acquainted with
1|the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address
1|him formally.) "Though I don't agree with the gentleman..." (he
1|hesitated: he wished to say, "Mon tres honorable preopinant"--"My very
1|honorable opponent") "with the gentleman... whom I have not the
1|honor of knowing, I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not
1|merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider
1|the means by which we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine," he went
1|on, warming to his subject, "that the Emperor himself would not be
1|satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing
1|to devote to his service, and chair a canon* we are ready to make of
1|ourselves--and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel."
1|
1|
1|*"Food for cannon."
1|
1|
1|Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator's
1|sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre's remarks. Only Count Rostov
1|was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval
1|officer, the senator, and in general with whatever speech he had
1|last heard.
1|
1|"I think that before discussing these questions," Pierre
1|continued, "we should ask the Emperor--most respectfully ask His
1|Majesty--to let us know the number of our troops and the position in
1|which our army and our forces now are, and then..."
1|
1|But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked
1|from three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old
1|acquaintance, a boston player who had always been well disposed toward
1|him, Stepan Stepanovich Adraksin. Adraksin was in uniform, and whether
1|as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw
1|before him quite a different man. With a sudden expression of
1|malevolence on his aged face, Adraksin shouted at Pierre:
1|
1|"In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the
1|Emperor about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that
1|right, the Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are
1|moved according to the enemy's movements and the number of men
1|increases and decreases..."
1|
1|Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty
1|years of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies' and knew as
1|a bad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to
1|Pierre, interrupted Adraksin.
1|
1|"Yes, and this is not a time for discussing," he continued, "but for
1|acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy
1|Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our
1|wives and children." The nobleman smote his breast. "We will all
1|arise, every one of us will go, for our father the Tsar!" he
1|shouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were
1|heard in the crowd. "We are Russians and will not grudge our blood
1|in defense of our faith, the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease
1|raving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe how
1|Russia rises to the defense of Russia!"
1|
1|Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that
1|his words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible
1|than the sound of his opponent's voice.
1|
1|Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval;
1|several persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end
1|of a phrase, said:
1|
1|"That's right, quite right! Just so!"
1|
1|Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his
1|serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in
1|order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many
1|voices shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostov had
1|not time to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased,
1|dispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the
1|largest hall and to the big table. Not only was Pierre's attempt to
1|speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and
1|people turned away from him as from a common enemy. This happened
1|not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech, which
1|had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches, but to
1|animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible
1|object to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other orators spoke
1|after the excited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke
1|eloquently and with originality.
1|
1|Glinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized
1|(cries of "author! author!" were heard in the crowd), said that
1|"hell must be repulsed by hell," and that he had seen a child
1|smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps, but "we will not be
1|that child."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!" was repeated approvingly in the back
1|rows of the crowd.
1|
1|The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or
1|bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of
1|whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or
1|playing boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd
1|advanced to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of
1|the chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two
1|together. Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to
1|say and hastened to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked
1|their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it. The old
1|magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned to look first at one and
1|then at another, and their faces for the most part only expressed
1|the fact that they found it very hot. Pierre, however, felt excited,
1|and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all
1|lengths--which found expression in the tones and looks more than in
1|the substance of the speeches--infected him too. He did not renounce
1|his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to
1|justify himself.
1|
1|"I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
1|when we know what is needed!" said he, trying to be heard above the
1|other voices.
1|
1|One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention
1|was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the
1|table.
1|
1|"Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!"
1|shouted one man.
1|
1|"He is the enemy of mankind!" cried another. "Allow me to speak...."
1|"Gentlemen, you are crushing me!..."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIII
1|
1|
1|At that moment Count Rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert
1|eyes, wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder,
1|entered the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of
1|gentry.
1|
1|"Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment," said
1|Rostopchin. "I am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are
1|in, I think there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has
1|deigned to summon us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth
1|from there"--he pointed to the merchants' hall--"but our business is
1|to supply men and not spare ourselves... That is the least we can do!"
1|
1|A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the
1|table. The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all
1|the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after
1|another, "I agree," or for variety, "I too am of that opinion," and so
1|on had even a mournful effect.
1|
1|The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow
1|nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully
1|equipped, out of every thousand serfs, as the Smolensk gentry had
1|done. Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had
1|conferred rose with apparent relief, and began walking up and down,
1|arm in arm, to stretch their legs and converse in couples.
1|
1|"The Emperor! The Emperor!" a sudden cry resounded through the halls
1|and the whole throng hurried to the entrance.
1|
1|The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two
1|lines of nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck
1|curiosity. Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the
1|Emperor said. From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor
1|spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he
1|placed on the Moscow nobility. He was answered by a voice which
1|informed him of the resolution just arrived at.
1|
1|"Gentlemen!" said the Emperor with a quivering voice.
1|
1|There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so
1|that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor
1|saying with emotion:
1|
1|"I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it
1|has surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the
1|Fatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious..."
1|
1|The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and
1|rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.
1|
1|"Yes, most precious... a royal word," said Count Rostov, with a sob.
1|He stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything,
1|understood everything in his own way.
1|
1|From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the
1|merchants. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those
1|who saw him come out from the merchants' hall with tears of emotion in
1|his eyes. As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address
1|the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in
1|a trembling voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out
1|accompanied by two merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat
1|otkupshchik. The other was the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face
1|and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled the thin man's eyes,
1|and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept
1|repeating:
1|
1|"Our lives and property--take them, Your Majesty!"
1|
1|Pierre's one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was
1|ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He
1|now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and
1|sought an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mamonov
1|was furnishing a regiment, Bezukhov at once informed Rostopchin that
1|he would give a thousand men and their maintenance.
1|
1|Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears,
1|and at once consented to Petya's request and went himself to enter his
1|name.
1|
1|Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took
1|off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs,
1|and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the
1|enrollment, feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.

1|BOOK TEN: 1812
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going
1|to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he
1|received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to
1|the stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain
1|from bursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and then of Balashev.
1|
1|Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be
1|personally insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the
1|best way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a
1|great commander. Rostov charged the French because he could not
1|restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same
1|way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord
1|with their personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and
1|aims. They were moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant,
1|reasoned, imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it
1|of their own free will, but they all were involuntary tools of
1|history, carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible
1|to us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and the higher
1|they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.
1|
1|The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
1|interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of
1|that time but its historic results.
1|
1|Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal
1|aims, to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of
1|them at all expected--neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still
1|less any of those who did the actual fighting.
1|
1|The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear
1|to us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand,
1|its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any
1|preparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, the character
1|given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the
1|foe this aroused among the Russian people. But no one at the time
1|foresaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army
1|of eight hundred thousand men--the best in the world and led by the
1|best general--could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half
1|its numerical strength, and led by inexperienced commanders as the
1|Russian army was. Not only did no one see this, but on the Russian
1|side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save
1|Russia, while on the French side, despite Napoleon's experience and
1|so-called military genius, every effort was directed to pushing on
1|to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing
1|that was bound to lead to destruction.
1|
1|In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of
1|saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he
1|sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk,
1|and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the
1|campaign was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of
1|telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war
1|plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this
1|plan some of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman,
1|others to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself--pointing to
1|notes, projects, and letters which contain hints of such a line of
1|action. But all these hints at what happened, both from the French
1|side and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the
1|event. Had that event not occurred these hints would have been
1|forgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints
1|and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now
1|been forgotten because the event falsified them. There are always so
1|many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end
1|there will always be people to say: "I said then that it would be so,"
1|quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to
1|quite the contrary effect.
1|
1|Conjectures as to Napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending
1|his line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the
1|depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much
1|straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and
1|his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts
1|are in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period
1|of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw
1|the French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry
1|into Russia everything was done to stop them. And not only was
1|Napoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step
1|forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former
1|campaigns, but very lazily.
1|
1|At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our
1|sole aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage
1|if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the
1|country. Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every
1|inch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp
1|was formed on Pfuel's plan, and there was no intention of retiring
1|farther. The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step
1|they retired. He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even
1|reach Smolensk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow,
1|and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smolensk was
1|abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought
1|under its walls.
1|
1|So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were
1|still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating
1|into the depths of the country.
1|
1|Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country
1|and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he
1|was at Smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther, though
1|as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.
1|
1|The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of
1|the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders
1|then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring
1|of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any
1|plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most
1|complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who
1|took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable,
1|or of the one way of saving Russia. Everything came about
1|fortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the
1|campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving
1|battle and checking the enemy's advance, and by this effort to unite
1|them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily
1|withdrawing the armies at an acute angle--we led the French on to
1|Smolensk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the
1|French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more
1|acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an
1|unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagration (who would come under his
1|command), and Bagration--being in command of the second army--tried to
1|postpone joining up and coming under Barclay's command as long as he
1|could. Bagration was slow in effecting the junction--though that was
1|the chief aim of all at headquarters--because, as he alleged, he
1|exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to
1|retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from
1|flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army;
1|and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the
1|command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior
1|to his own.
1|
1|The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence
1|and ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of
1|advisers and plans, destroyed the first army's energy and it retired.
1|
1|The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but
1|Paulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed
1|his energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel's whole plan was
1|abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not
1|inspire confidence his power was limited. The armies were divided,
1|there was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from
1|this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign
1|commander in chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and
1|the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from
1|had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay,
1|been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation
1|against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.
1|
1|At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and
1|indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was
1|necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the
1|nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor
1|to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled.
1|
1|He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief's
1|undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action
1|would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more
1|confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarevich, and a swarm of
1|adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in
1|chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling
1|less free than ever under the observation of all these "eyes of the
1|Emperor," became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive
1|action and avoided giving battle.
1|
1|Barclay stood for caution. The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and
1|demanded a general engagement. Lubomirski, Bronnitski, Wlocki, and the
1|others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under
1|pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish
1|adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with
1|Bennigsen and the Tsarevich.
1|
1|At Smolensk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagration
1|disliked it.
1|
1|Bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.
1|Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior
1|officer Bagration.
1|
1|Despite his seniority in rank Bagration, in this contest of
1|magnanimity, took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted,
1|agreed with him less than ever. By the Emperor's orders Bagration
1|reported direct to him. He wrote to Arakcheev, the Emperor's
1|confidant: "It must be as my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with
1|the Minister (meaning Barclay). For God's sake send me somewhere
1|else if only in command of a regiment. I cannot stand it here.
1|Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist and
1|there is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving my
1|sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving
1|Barclay. I confess I do not want to."
1|
1|The swarm of Bronnitskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still
1|further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief,
1|and even less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the
1|French before Smolensk. A general was sent to survey the position.
1|This general, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a
1|corps commander, and, having spent the day with him, returned to
1|Barclay and condemned, as unsuitable from every point of view, the
1|battleground he had not seen.
1|
1|While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of
1|battle, and while we were looking for the French--having lost touch
1|with them--the French stumbled upon Neverovski's division and
1|reached the walls of Smolensk.
1|
1|It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk to save
1|our lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were
1|killed on both sides.
1|
1|Smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and
1|of the whole people. But Smolensk was burned by its own
1|inhabitants-who had been misled by their governor. And these ruined
1|inhabitants, setting an example to other Russians, went to Moscow
1|thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe.
1|Napoleon advanced farther and we retired, thus arriving at the very
1|result which caused his destruction.

1|The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess
1|Mary to come to his study.
1|
1|"Well? Are you satisfied now?" said he. "You've made me quarrel with
1|my son! Satisfied, are you? That's all you wanted! Satisfied?... It
1|hurts me, it hurts. I'm old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well
1|then, gloat over it! Gloat over it!"
1|
1|After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He
1|was ill and did not leave his study.
1|
1|Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the
1|old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne either. Tikhon alone attended him.
1|
1|At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his
1|former way of life, devoting himself with special activity to building
1|operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely
1|breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks
1|and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say: "There, you see? You
1|plotted against me, you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations
1|with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, but you see I need
1|neither her nor you!"
1|
1|Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching
1|his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to
1|Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her
1|old nurse, or with "God's folk" who sometimes came by the back door to
1|see her.
1|
1|Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She
1|feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at
1|the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did
1|not understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her
1|like all previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this
1|war, though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was
1|passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own
1|conception of it to her, and though the "God's folk" who came to see
1|her reported, in their own way, the rumors current among the people of
1|an invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie (now Princess
1|Drubetskaya), who had resumed correspondence with her, wrote patriotic
1|letters from Moscow.
1|
1|"I write you in Russian, my good friend," wrote Julie in her
1|Frenchified Russian, "because I have a detestation for all the French,
1|and the same for their language which I cannot support to hear
1|spoken.... We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored
1|Emperor.
1|
1|"My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but
1|the news which I have inspires me yet more.
1|
1|"You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski, embracing
1|his two sons and saying: 'I will perish with them but we will not be
1|shaken!' And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we
1|were unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The
1|princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy
1|widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie,
1|only you, my friend, are missing..." and so on.
1|
1|The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance
1|of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not
1|recognize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.
1|The prince's tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary
1|unhesitatingly believed him.
1|
1|All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even
1|animated. He planned another garden and began a new building for the
1|domestic serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about
1|him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his
1|study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would
1|order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he
1|remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and
1|dozed there without undressing, while--instead of Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne--a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night
1|in the dining room.
1|
1|On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his
1|first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had
1|dutifully asked his father's forgiveness for what he had allowed
1|himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this
1|letter the old prince had replied affectionately, and from that time
1|had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew's second letter,
1|written near Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a
1|brief account of the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had
1|drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war. In this
1|letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying
1|at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on the army's direct
1|line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.
1|
1|At dinner that day, on Dessalles' mentioning that the French were
1|said to have already entered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered his
1|son's letter.
1|
1|"There was a letter from Prince Andrew today," he said to Princess
1|Mary--"Haven't you read it?"
1|
1|"No, Father," she replied in a frightened voice.
1|
1|She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
1|arrived.
1|
1|"He writes about this war," said the prince, with the ironic smile
1|that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.
1|
1|"That must be very interesting," said Dessalles. "Prince Andrew is
1|in a position to know..."
1|
1|"Oh, very interesting!" said Mademoiselle Bourienne.
1|
1|"Go and get it for me," said the old prince to Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne. "You know--under the paperweight on the little table."
1|
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.
1|
1|"No, don't!" he exclaimed with a frown. "You go, Michael Ivanovich."
1|
1|Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he
1|had left the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down
1|his napkin and went himself.
1|
1|"They can't do anything... always make some muddle," he muttered.
1|
1|While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne, and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The
1|old prince returned with quick steps, accompanied by Michael
1|Ivanovich, bringing the letter and a plan. These he put down beside
1|him--not letting anyone read them at dinner.
1|
1|On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess
1|Mary and, spreading out before him the plan of the new building and
1|fixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she
1|had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was
1|examining the plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.
1|
1|"What do you think of it, Prince?" Dessalles ventured to ask.
1|
1|"I? I?..." said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not
1|taking his eyes from the plan of the building.
1|
1|"Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that..."
1|
1|"Ha ha ha! The theater of war!" said the prince. "I have said and
1|still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never
1|get beyond the Niemen."
1|
1|Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of
1|the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess
1|Mary, forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that
1|what her father was saying was correct.
1|
1|"When the snow melts they'll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they
1|could fail to see it," the prince continued, evidently thinking of the
1|campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. "Bennigsen should have
1|advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different
1|turn..."
1|
1|"But, Prince," Dessalles began timidly, "the letter mentions
1|Vitebsk...."
1|
1|"Ah, the letter? Yes..." replied the prince peevishly. "Yes...
1|yes..." His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused.
1|"Yes, he writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river
1|is it?"
1|
1|Dessalles dropped his eyes.
1|
1|"The prince says nothing about that," he remarked gently.
1|
1|"Doesn't he? But I didn't invent it myself."
1|
1|No one spoke for a long time.
1|
1|"Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivanovich," he suddenly went on,
1|raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building, "tell me
1|how you mean to alter it...."
1|
1|Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking
1|to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and
1|Dessalles and went to his own room.
1|
1|Princess Mary saw Dessalles' embarrassed and astonished look fixed
1|on her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that
1|her father had forgotten his son's letter on the drawing-room table;
1|but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the
1|reason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think
1|about it.
1|
1|In the evening Michael Ivanovich, sent by the prince, came to
1|Princess Mary for Prince Andrew's letter which had been forgotten in
1|the drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to
1|her to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing.
1|
1|"Always busy," replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully
1|ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. "He's worrying
1|very much about the new building. He has been reading a little, but
1|now"--Michael Ivanovich went on, lowering his voice--"now he's at
1|his desk, busy with his will, I expect." (One of the prince's favorite
1|occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant
1|to leave at his death and which he called his "will.")
1|
1|"And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk?" asked Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter, the
1|old prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was
1|sitting at his open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in
1|his outstretched hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading
1|his manuscript--his "Remarks" as he termed it--which was to be
1|transmitted to the Emperor after his death.
1|
1|When Michael Ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince's eyes
1|evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had
1|been written. He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich's hand, put it
1|in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpatych who had
1|long been waiting.
1|
1|The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and,
1|walking up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door, he
1|gave his instructions.
1|
1|"First, notepaper--do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,
1|gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing
1|wax, as in Michael Ivanovich's list."
1|
1|He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.
1|
1|"Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed."
1|
1|Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to
1|be of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather
1|case had to be ordered to keep the "will" in.
1|
1|The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the
1|prince did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed
1|his eyes, and dozed off. Alpatych made a slight movement.
1|
1|"Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I'll send after you."
1|
1|Alpatych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into
1|it, fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at
1|the table to write to the governor.
1|
1|It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished
1|to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
1|thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tikhon and went through
1|the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.
1|
1|He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed
1|unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.
1|That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive
1|thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory
1|everywhere, but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was
1|better than other places: he had never slept there yet.
1|
1|With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and
1|began putting it up.
1|
1|"That's not right! That's not right!" cried the prince, and
1|himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in
1|again.
1|
1|"Well, at last I've finished, now I'll rest," thought the prince,
1|and let Tikhon undress him.
1|
1|Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself
1|of his coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on
1|the bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously
1|at his withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring
1|the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on
1|the bed. "Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you
1|would release me!" thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that
1|effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had
1|he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards
1|beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened
1|to him almost every night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.
1|
1|"No peace, damn them!" he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. "Ah
1|yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was
1|keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.
1|No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary
1|talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something.
1|Something in my pocket--can't remember..."
1|
1|"Tikhon, what did we talk about at dinner?"
1|
1|"About Prince Michael..."
1|
1|"Be quiet, quiet!" The prince slapped his hand on the table. "Yes, I
1|know, Prince Andrew's letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said
1|something about Vitebsk. Now I'll read it."
1|
1|He had the letter taken from his pocket and the table--on which
1|stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle--moved close to
1|the bed, and putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in
1|the stillness of the night, reading it by the faint light under the
1|green shade, did he grasp its meaning for a moment.
1|
1|"The French at Vitebsk, in four days' march they may be at Smolensk;
1|perhaps are already there! Tikhon!" Tikhon jumped up. "No, no, I don't
1|want anything!" he shouted.
1|
1|He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And
1|there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian
1|camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,
1|vigorous and alert, entering Potemkin's gaily colored tent, and a
1|burning sense of jealousy of "the favorite" agitated him now as
1|strongly as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that
1|first meeting with Potemkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather
1|sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile
1|and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that
1|same face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Zubov
1|over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand.
1|
1|"Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with
1|all the present! Quicker, quicker--and that they should leave me in
1|peace!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkonski's estate, lay forty miles east
1|from Smolensk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.
1|
1|The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to
1|Alpatych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that,
1|as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure
1|his safety, though from Prince Andrew's letter it was evident that
1|to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised
1|her to send a letter by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor at
1|Smolensk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the
1|extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles
1|wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed it,
1|and it was given to Alpatych with instructions to hand it to the
1|Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.
1|
1|Having received all his orders Alpatych, wearing a white beaver hat--a
1|present from the prince--and carrying a stick as the prince did, went
1|out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready
1|harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.
1|
1|The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness
1|stuffed with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive
1|with ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpatych liked to have them.
1|His satellites--the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery
1|maid, a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and
1|various domestic serfs--were seeing him off.
1|
1|His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on
1|and behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle,
1|and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.
1|
1|"There! There! Women's fuss! Women, women!" said Alpatych, puffing
1|and speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the
1|trap.
1|
1|After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpatych,
1|not trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald
1|head and crossed himself three times.
1|
1|"If there is anything... come back, Yakov Alpatych! For Christ's
1|sake think of us!" cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war
1|and the enemy.
1|
1|"Women, women! Women's fuss!" muttered Alpatych to himself and
1|started on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye
1|and the still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black
1|fields just being plowed a second time.
1|
1|As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year's splendid crop
1|of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there
1|were already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing
1|and the harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of
1|the prince's orders.
1|
1|Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town
1|toward evening on the fourth of August.
1|
1|Alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on
1|the road. As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of distant
1|firing, but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the
1|sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and
1|which was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder.
1|This fact impressed Alpatych, but in thinking about his own business
1|he soon forgot it.
1|
1|All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
1|bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that
1|limit. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince's
1|orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych.
1|
1|On reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August he put
1|up in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by
1|Ferapontov, where he had been in the habit of putting up for the
1|last thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferapontov, by Alpatych's
1|advice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now
1|had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer's shop in that province. He was
1|a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a
1|broad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and
1|a round belly.
1|
1|Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapontov was standing
1|before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpatych he
1|went up to him.
1|
1|"You're welcome, Yakov Alpatych. Folks are leaving the town, but you
1|have come to it," said he.
1|
1|"Why are they leaving the town?" asked Alpatych.
1|
1|"That's what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French."
1|
1|"Women's fuss, women's fuss!" said Alpatych.
1|
1|"Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych. What I say is: orders have
1|been given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants
1|are asking three rubles for carting--it isn't Christian!"
1|
1|Yakov Alpatych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for
1|hay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.
1|
1|All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning
1|Alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on
1|business. It was a sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already
1|hot. "A good day for harvesting," thought Alpatych.
1|
1|From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At
1|eight o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of
1|musketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were
1|many soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at
1|their shops, and service was being held in the churches as usual.
1|Alpatych went to the shops, to government offices, to the post office,
1|and to the Governor's. In the offices and shops and at the post office
1|everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was
1|already attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be
1|done, and all were trying to calm one another.
1|
1|In front of the Governor's house Alpatych found a large number of
1|people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor's. At the
1|porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This
1|man, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:
1|
1|"It's no joke, you know! It's all very well if you're single. 'One
1|man though undone is but one,' as the proverb says, but with
1|thirteen in your family and all the property... They've brought us
1|to utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do that? They
1|ought to be hanged--the brigands!..."
1|
1|"Oh come, that's enough!" said the other.
1|
1|"What do I care? Let him hear! We're not dogs," said the
1|ex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed Alpatych.
1|
1|"Oh, Yakov Alpatych! What have you come for?"
1|
1|"To see the Governor by his excellency's order," answered
1|Alpatych, lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the
1|bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince....
1|"He has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs," he added.
1|
1|"Yes, go and find out!" shouted the angry gentleman. "They've
1|brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or
1|anything!... There it is again, do you hear?" said he, pointing
1|in the direction whence came the sounds of firing.
1|
1|"They've brought us all to ruin... the brigands!" he repeated, and
1|descended the porch steps.
1|
1|Alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were
1|tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another.
1|The door of the Governor's room opened and they all rose and moved
1|forward. An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called
1|a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and
1|vanished again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and
1|questions addressed to him. Alpatych moved forward and next time the
1|official came out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of
1|his buttoned coat, and handed him two letters.
1|
1|"To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkonski,"
1|he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official
1|turned to him and took the letters.
1|
1|A few minutes later the Governor received Alpatych and hurriedly
1|said to him:
1|
1|"Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on
1|the highest instructions--here..." and he handed a paper to
1|Alpatych. "Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they
1|should go to Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them..."
1|
1|But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into
1|the room and began to say something in French. The Governor's face
1|expressed terror.
1|
1|"Go," he said, nodding his head to Alpatych, and began questioning
1|the officer.
1|
1|Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpatych when
1|he came out of the Governor's room. Involuntarily listening now to the
1|firing, which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength,
1|Alpatych hurried to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor
1|said this:
1|
1|
1|"I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the slightest
1|danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with
1|any. I from the one side and Prince Bagration from the other are
1|marching to unite our forces before Smolensk, which junction will be
1|effected on the 22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces
1|will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care
1|till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland,
1|or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From
1|this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the
1|inhabitants of Smolensk, for those defended by two such brave armies
1|may feel assured of victory." (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to
1|Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smolensk, 1812.)
1|
1|
1|People were anxiously roaming about the streets.
1|
1|Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept
1|emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.
1|Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapontov's and women were
1|wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round
1|barking in front of the harnessed horses.
1|
1|Alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went
1|straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman
1|was asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the
1|passage. From the host's room came the sounds of a child crying, the
1|despairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of
1|Ferapontov. The cook began running hither and thither in the passage
1|like a frightened hen, just as Alpatych entered.
1|
1|"He's done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged
1|her about so!..."
1|
1|"What for?" asked Alpatych.
1|
1|"She kept begging to go away. She's a woman! 'Take me away,' says
1|she, 'don't let me perish with my little children! Folks,' she says,
1|'are all gone, so why,' she says, 'don't we go?' And he began
1|beating and pulling her about so!"
1|
1|At these words Alpatych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to
1|hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper's, where
1|he had left his purchases.
1|
1|"You brute, you murderer!" screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a
1|baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through
1|the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard.
1|
1|Ferapontov came out after her, but on seeing Alpatych adjusted his
1|waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpatych into the
1|opposite room.
1|
1|"Going already?" said he.
1|
1|Alpatych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his
1|packages and asked how much he owed.
1|
1|"We'll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor's?" asked
1|Ferapontov. "What has been decided?"
1|
1|Alpatych replied that the Governor had not told him anything
1|definite.
1|
1|"With our business, how can we get away?" said Ferapontov. "We'd
1|have to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and I tell them
1|they're not Christians to ask it! Selivanov, now, did a good stroke
1|last Thursday--sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will
1|you have some tea?" he added.
1|
1|While the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov over
1|their tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather
1|for harvesting.
1|
1|"Well, it seems to be getting quieter," remarked Ferapontov,
1|finishing his third cup of tea and getting up. "Ours must have got the
1|best of it. The orders were not to let them in. So we're in force,
1|it seems.... They say the other day Matthew Ivanych Platov drove
1|them into the river Marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one
1|day."
1|
1|Alpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who
1|had come in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels,
1|hoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed
1|out.
1|
1|It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in
1|shadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpatych looked out of
1|the window and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a
1|far-off whistling and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon
1|blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling.
1|
1|He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the
1|bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of
1|cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds
1|were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside
1|the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town
1|was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had
1|ordered up after four o'clock. The people did not at once realize
1|the meaning of this bombardment.
1|
1|At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
1|curiosity. Ferapontov's wife, who till then had not ceased wailing
1|under the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the
1|gate, listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.
1|
1|The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively
1|curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they
1|flew over their heads. Several people came round the corner talking
1|eagerly.
1|
1|"What force!" remarked one. "Knocked the roof and ceiling all to
1|splinters!"
1|
1|"Routed up the earth like a pig," said another.
1|
1|"That's grand, it bucks one up!" laughed the first. "Lucky you
1|jumped aside, or it would have wiped you out!"
1|
1|Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had
1|fallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now
1|with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the
1|agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people's heads
1|incessantly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpatych
1|was getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.
1|
1|"What are you staring at?" he shouted to the cook, who in her red
1|skirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped
1|to the corner to listen to what was being said.
1|
1|"What marvels!" she exclaimed, but hearing her master's voice she
1|turned back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.
1|
1|Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping
1|downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the
1|street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.
1|
1|"Scoundrel, what are you doing?" shouted the innkeeper, rushing to
1|the cook.
1|
1|At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
1|sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently
1|with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was
1|her wailing.
1|
1|"Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don't let me die! My good
1|souls!..."
1|
1|Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her
1|thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.
1|Alpatych, his coachman, Ferapontov's wife and children and the house
1|porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns,
1|the whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook,
1|which rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The
1|mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the
1|cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband
1|who had remained in the street. A shopman who entered told her that
1|her husband had gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were
1|fetching the wonder-working icon of Smolensk.
1|
1|Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpatych left the cellar
1|and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was
1|clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon
1|shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a
1|hush seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of
1|footsteps, the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires
1|which seemed widespread everywhere. The cook's moans had now subsided.
1|On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the
1|fires. Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or
1|ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined
1|ant-hill. Several of them ran into Ferapontov's yard before Alpatych's
1|eyes. Alpatych went out to the gate. A retreating regiment,
1|thronging and hurrying, blocked the street.
1|
1|Noticing him, an officer said: "The town is being abandoned. Get
1|away, get away!" and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:
1|
1|"I'll teach you to run into the yards!"
1|
1|Alpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him
1|to set off. Ferapontov's whole household came out too, following
1|Alpatych and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then,
1|suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires--the smoke and even
1|the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight--and as if
1|in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of
1|the street. Inside the shed Alpatych and the coachman arranged the
1|tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands.
1|
1|As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers
1|in Ferapontov's open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and
1|knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapontov
1|returned and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about
1|to shout at them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair,
1|burst into sobs and laughter:
1|
1|"Loot everything, lads! Don't let those devils get it!" he cried,
1|taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.
1|
1|Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on
1|filling their bags. On seeing Alpatych, Ferapontov turned to him:
1|
1|"Russia is done for!" he cried. "Alpatych, I'll set the place on
1|fire myself. We're done for!..." and Ferapontov ran into the yard.
1|
1|Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking
1|it completely, so that Alpatych could not pass out and had to wait.
1|Ferapontov's wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting
1|till it was possible to drive out.
1|
1|Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone
1|out amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the
1|Dnieper Alpatych's cart and that of the innkeeper's wife, which were
1|slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had
1|to stop. In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had
1|stopped, a house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already
1|burning itself out. The flames now died down and were lost in the
1|black smoke, now suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with
1|strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the
1|crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and through
1|the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be
1|heard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some
1|time, Alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the
1|fire. Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near
1|it, and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning
1|beams into another yard across the street, while others carried
1|bundles of hay.
1|
1|Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn
1|which was blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back
1|wall had fallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters
1|were alight. The crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in,
1|and Alpatych watched for it too.
1|
1|"Alpatych!" a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.
1|
1|"Mercy on us! Your excellency!" answered Alpatych, immediately
1|recognizing the voice of his young prince.
1|
1|Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was
1|looking at Alpatych from the back of the crowd.
1|
1|"Why are you here?" he asked.
1|
1|"Your... your excellency," stammered Alpatych and broke into sobs.
1|"Are we really lost? Master!..."
1|
1|"Why are you here?" Prince Andrew repeated.
1|
1|At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master's
1|pale worn face. Alpatych told how he had been sent there and how
1|difficult it was to get away.
1|
1|"Are we really quite lost, your excellency?" he asked again.
1|
1|Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his
1|knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his
1|sister:
1|
1|
1|"Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the
1|enemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at
1|once when you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyazh."
1|
1|
1|Having written this and given the paper to Alpatych, he told him how
1|to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the
1|boy's tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before
1|he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of
1|staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.
1|
1|"You are a colonel?" shouted the chief of staff with a German
1|accent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. "Houses are set on
1|fire in your presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You
1|will answer for it!" shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the
1|chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of
1|the first army, a place, as Berg said, "very agreeable and well en
1|evidence."
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
1|Alpatych.
1|
1|"So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by
1|the tenth I don't receive news that they have all got away I shall
1|have to throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills."
1|
1|"Prince," said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, "I only spoke
1|because I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly....
1|You must please excuse me," he went on apologetically.
1|
1|Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and
1|wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another
1|terrible crash and something huge collapsed.
1|
1|"Ou-rou-rou!" yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the
1|collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a
1|cakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up again, lighting the
1|animated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators.
1|
1|The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:
1|
1|"It's fine, lads! Now it's raging... It's fine!"
1|
1|"That's the owner himself," cried several voices.
1|
1|"Well then," continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, "report to them as
1|I have told you"; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute
1|beside him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the
1|enemy. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was
1|marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills.
1|Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day
1|fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the
1|sun, but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in
1|reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The
1|unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up.
1|The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched
1|meadows. Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was
1|there any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along which the
1|troops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or when
1|the road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the
1|sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep. As soon as day dawned
1|the march began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly
1|through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and
1|the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that
1|never cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the
1|feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the
1|troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all
1|in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road.
1|The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and
1|through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
1|eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
1|sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless
1|atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses
1|and mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to
1|the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of
1|that regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving
1|and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolensk and its
1|abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger
1|against the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely
1|devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to
1|his men and officers. In the regiment they called him "our prince,"
1|were proud of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to
1|those of his regiment, to Timokhin and the like--people quite new to
1|him, belonging to a different world and who could not know and
1|understand his past. As soon as he came across a former acquaintance
1|or anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately and grew
1|spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded him
1|of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that
1|former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not
1|to be unfair.
1|
1|In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
1|Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the
1|sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been
1|defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow,
1|abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built
1|and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew
1|had something to think about entirely apart from general questions.
1|Two days previously he had received news that his father, son, and
1|sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do
1|at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment
1|his own grief decided that he must ride there.
1|
1|He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on
1|the march, rode to his father's estate where he had been born and
1|spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to
1|be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it
1|with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul
1|about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and
1|half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He
1|rode to the keeper's lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of
1|the drive and the door stood open. Grass had already begun to grow
1|on the garden paths, and horses and calves were straying in the
1|English park. Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass
1|panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and
1|others dried up. He called for Taras the gardener, but no one replied.
1|Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden,
1|he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the
1|plum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom
1|Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was
1|sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.
1|
1|He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting
1|on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him
1|strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a
1|magnolia.
1|
1|Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old
1|garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were
1|wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes. The shutters
1|were all closed, except at one window which was open. A little serf
1|boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Alpatych, having sent
1|his family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors
1|reading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince Andrew had
1|come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose, buttoning his coat,
1|and, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping and kissing
1|Prince Andrew's knee.
1|
1|Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to
1|report on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable
1|had been removed to Bogucharovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also
1|been carted away. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alpatych
1|said there had been a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered
1|by the troops and mown down while still green. The peasants were
1|ruined; some of them too had gone to Bogucharovo, only a few remained.
1|
1|Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:
1|
1|"When did my father and sister leave?" meaning when did they leave
1|for Moscow.
1|
1|Alpatych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for
1|Bogucharovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again
1|went into details concerning the estate management, asking for
1|instructions.
1|
1|"Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for
1|them? We have still six hundred quarters left," he inquired.
1|
1|"What am I to say to him?" thought Prince Andrew, looking down on
1|the old man's bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the
1|expression on his face that the old man himself understood how
1|untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief.
1|
1|"Yes, let them have it," replied Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"If you noticed some disorder in the garden," said Alpatych, "it was
1|impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the
1|night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their
1|commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it."
1|
1|"Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy
1|occupies the place?" asked Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Alpatych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and
1|suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm.
1|
1|"He is my refuge! His will be done!" he exclaimed.
1|
1|A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow
1|toward the prince.
1|
1|"Well, good-by!" said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpatych.
1|"You must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go
1|to the Ryazan estate or to the one near Moscow."
1|
1|Alpatych clung to Prince Andrew's leg and burst into sobs. Gently
1|disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
1|avenue at a gallop.
1|
1|The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly
1|impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on
1|which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out
1|from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked
1|from the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young
1|master, the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger
1|companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not
1|stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped.
1|
1|Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them
1|see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty
1|frightened little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt
1|an irresistible desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief
1|came over him when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of
1|other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as
1|legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these girls
1|passionately desired one thing--to carry away and eat those green
1|plums without being caught--and Prince Andrew shared their wish for
1|the success of their enterprise. He could not resist looking at them
1|once more. Believing their danger past, they sprang from their
1|ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill little voices and
1|holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned feet scampered
1|merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the
1|dusty highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from
1|Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment
1|at its halting place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one
1|o'clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his
1|back intolerably through his black coat. The dust always hung
1|motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops.
1|There was no wind. As he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the
1|ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to get into that water,
1|however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from
1|whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, green
1|pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because
1|it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red
1|hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it. All this
1|naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in
1|that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the
1|suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially
1|pathetic.
1|
1|One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince
1|Andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed
1|himself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water;
1|another, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood
1|up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure
1|and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head
1|with hands blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men
1|slapping one another, yelling, and puffing.
1|
1|Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was
1|healthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timokhin, with his red
1|little nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt
1|confused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind to address him
1|nevertheless.
1|
1|"It's very nice, your excellency! Wouldn't you like to?" said he.
1|
1|"It's dirty," replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.
1|
1|"We'll clear it out for you in a minute," said Timokhin, and,
1|still undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.
1|
1|"The prince wants to bathe."
1|
1|"What prince? Ours?" said many voices, and the men were in such
1|haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He
1|decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn.
1|
1|"Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!" he thought, and he looked at his own
1|naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust
1|and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that
1|immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.
1|
1|
1|On the seventh of August Prince Bagration wrote as follows from
1|his quarters at Mikhaylovna on the Smolensk road:

1|
1|Dear Count Alexis Andreevich--(He was writing to Arakcheev but
1|knew that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore
1|weighed every word in it to the best of his ability.)
1|
1|I expect the Minister [Barclay de Tolly] has already reported the
1|abandonment of Smolensk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and
1|the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
1|wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most
1|urgently and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to
1|consent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as
1|never before and might have lost half his army but could not have
1|taken Smolensk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, as never
1|before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at bay for
1|thirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold out even for
1|fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for
1|him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our
1|losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not
1|more, and not even that; but even were they ten thousand, that's
1|war! But the enemy has lost masses...
1|
1|What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They
1|would have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water
1|for men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but
1|suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. We
1|cannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow...
1|
1|There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you
1|should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats!
1|You would set all Russia against you and every one of us would feel
1|ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this--we must fight
1|as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand...
1|
1|One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may
1|perhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad
1|but execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole
1|country.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing
1|boldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a
1|peace, and that the Minister should command the army, does not love
1|our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. So I write you
1|frankly: call out the militia. For the Minister is leading these
1|visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way. The whole army
1|feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is
1|said to be more Napoleon's man than ours, and he is always advising
1|the Minister. I am not merely civil to him but obey him like a
1|corporal, though I am his senior. This is painful, but, loving my
1|benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am sorry for the Emperor
1|that he entrusts our fine army to such as he. Consider that on our
1|retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than
1|fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would not have
1|happened. Tell me, for God's sake, what will Russia, our mother
1|Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning
1|our good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings
1|of hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and
1|of whom are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is
1|vacillating, a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The
1|whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him...
1|

1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of
1|human life one may discriminate between those in which substance
1|prevails and those in which form prevails. To the latter--as
1|distinguished from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow
1|life--we may allot Petersburg life, and especially the life of its
1|salons. That life of the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805
1|we had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had
1|made constitutions and unmade them again, but the salons of Anna
1|Pavlovna and Helene remained just as they had been--the one seven and
1|the other five years before. At Anna Pavlovna's they talked with
1|perplexity of Bonaparte's successes just as before and saw in them and
1|in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a
1|malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause
1|unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna
1|Pavlovna was the representative. And in Helene's salon, which
1|Rumyantsev himself honored with his visits, regarding Helene as a
1|remarkably intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in
1|1812 as in 1808 of the "great nation" and the "great man," and
1|regretted our rupture with France, a rupture which, according to them,
1|ought to be promptly terminated by peace.
1|
1|Of late, since the Emperor's return from the army, there had been some
1|excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of
1|hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In
1|Anna Pavlovna's circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were
1|deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the
1|effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to
1|maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole
1|army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the
1|reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French
1|circle of Helene and Rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy
1|and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon's attempts at
1|conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those
1|who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazan of the court and
1|the girls' educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager
1|Empress. In Helene's circle the war in general was regarded as a series
1|of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the
1|view prevailed expressed by Bilibin--who now in Petersburg was quite at
1|home in Helene's house, which every clever man was obliged to
1|visit--that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters
1|be settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm--news of which had
1|reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor's return--was
1|ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this
1|enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the
1|ancients. Prince Vasili, who still occupied his former important
1|posts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He
1|visited his "good friend Anna Pavlovna" as well as his daughter's
1|"diplomatic salon," and often in his constant comings and goings
1|between the two camps became confused and said at Helene's what he
1|should have said at Anna Pavlovna's and vice versa.
1|
1|Soon after the Emperor's return Prince Vasili in a conversation
1|about the war at Anna Pavlovna's severely condemned Barclay de
1|Tolly, but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander
1|in chief. One of the visitors, usually spoken of as "a man of great
1|merit," having described how he had that day seen Kutuzov, the newly
1|chosen chief of the Petersburg militia, presiding over the
1|enrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest
1|that Kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutuzov had done
1|nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.
1|
1|"I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility," Prince
1|Vasili interrupted, "but they did not listen to me. I told them his
1|election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They
1|did not listen to me.
1|
1|"It's all this mania for opposition," he went on. "And who for? It is
1|all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those
1|Muscovites," Prince Vasili continued, forgetting for a moment that
1|though at Helene's one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna
1|Pavlovna's one had to be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his
1|mistake at once. "Now, is it suitable that Count Kutuzov, the oldest
1|general in Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He will get
1|nothing for his pains! How could they make a man commander in chief
1|who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the
1|very worst morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest!
1|I don't speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this
1|how they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively blind? A fine
1|idea to have a blind general! He can't see anything. To play
1|blindman's bluff? He can't see at all!"
1|
1|No one replied to his remarks.
1|
1|This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the
1|twenty-ninth of July Kutuzov received the title of Prince. This
1|might indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasili's
1|opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry
1|to express it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting
1|of Field Marshal Saltykov, Arakcheev, Vyazmitinov, Lopukhin, and
1|Kochubey met to consider the progress of the war. This committee
1|came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity
1|in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of
1|the Emperor's dislike of Kutuzov, after a short deliberation they
1|agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief. That same
1|day Kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the
1|armies and over the whole region occupied by them.
1|
1|On the ninth of August Prince Vasili at Anna Pavlovna's again met
1|the "man of great merit." The latter was very attentive to Anna
1|Pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the
1|educational establishments for young ladies. Prince Vasili entered the
1|room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object
1|of his desires.
1|
1|"Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutuzov is field
1|marshal! All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At
1|last we have a man!" said he, glancing sternly and significantly round
1|at everyone in the drawing room.
1|
1|The "man of great merit," despite his desire to obtain the post of
1|director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasili of his former
1|opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasili in Anna
1|Pavlovna's drawing room, and also to Anna Pavlovna herself who had
1|received the news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.
1|
1|"But, Prince, they say he is blind!" said he, reminding Prince
1|Vasili of his own words.
1|
1|"Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough," said Prince Vasili rapidly,
1|in a deep voice and with a slight cough--the voice and cough with
1|which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties.
1|
1|"He sees well enough," he added. "And what I am so pleased about,"
1|he went on, "is that our sovereign has given him full powers over
1|all the armies and the whole region--powers no commander in chief ever
1|had before. He is a second autocrat," he concluded with a victorious
1|smile.
1|
1|"God grant it! God grant it!" said Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|The "man of great merit," who was still a novice in court circles,
1|wishing to flatter Anna Pavlovna by defending her former position on
1|this question, observed:
1|
1|"It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutuzov those
1|powers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read,
1|when he said to Kutuzov: 'Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you
1|this honor.'"
1|
1|"Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech," said Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|"Oh, no, no!" warmly rejoined Prince Vasili, who would not now yield
1|Kutuzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutuzov was not only admirable
1|himself, but was adored by everybody. "No, that's impossible," said
1|he, "for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before."
1|
1|"God grant only that Prince Kutuzov assumes real power and does
1|not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel," observed Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasili said in a
1|whisper:
1|
1|"I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition that
1|the Tsarevich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to
1|the Emperor?"
1|
1|And Prince Vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by
1|Kutuzov to the Emperor. "I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
1|reward him if he does right."
1|
1|"Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutuzov! I have known him a long
1|time!"
1|
1|"They even say," remarked the "man of great merit" who did not yet
1|possess courtly tact, "that his excellency made it an express
1|condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army."
1|
1|As soon as he said this both Prince Vasili and Anna Pavlovna
1|turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at
1|his naivete.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already
1|passed Smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow.
1|Napoleon's historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to
1|justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against
1|his will. He is as right as other historians who look for the
1|explanation of historic events in the will of one man; he is as
1|right as the Russian historians who maintain that Napoleon was drawn
1|to Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders. Here besides the law
1|of retrospection, which regards all the past as a preparation for
1|events that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity comes in,
1|confusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer having lost a game is
1|sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made
1|and looks for that mistake in the opening, but forgets that at each
1|stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his
1|moves were perfect. He only notices the mistake to which he pays
1|attention, because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more
1|complex than this is the game of war, which occurs under certain
1|limits of time, and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless
1|objects, but everything results from innumerable conflicts of
1|various wills!
1|
1|After Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobuzh at Vyazma,
1|and then at Tsarevo-Zaymishche, but it happened that owing to a
1|conjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give
1|battle till they reached Borodino, seventy miles from Moscow. From
1|Vyazma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow.
1|
1|Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacree
1|des peuples d'Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme
1|de pagodes chinoises,* this Moscow gave Napoleon's imagination no
1|rest. On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light
1|bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his
1|pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind
1|to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by
1|Lelorgne d'Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a
1|gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression.
1|
1|
1|*"Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the sacred
1|city of Alexander's people, Moscow with its innumerable churches
1|shaped like Chinese pagodas."
1|
1|
1|"Well?" asked Napoleon.
1|
1|"One of Platov's Cossacks says that Platov's corps is joining up
1|with the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander in
1|chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow."
1|
1|Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and
1|bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several
1|adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavrushka, the serf Denisov
1|had handed over to Rostov, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly's
1|jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face.
1|Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.
1|
1|"You are a Cossack?"
1|
1|"Yes, a Cossack, your Honor."
1|
1|"The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon's
1|plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental
1|mind the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the
1|incidents of the war," says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality
1|Lavrushka, having got drunk the day before and left his master
1|dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
1|chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him
1|prisoner. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who
1|have seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do
1|everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort
1|of service to their master, and are keen at guessing their master's
1|baser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness.
1|
1|Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had
1|easily and surely recognized, Lavrushka was not in the least abashed
1|but merely did his utmost to gain his new master's favor.
1|
1|He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon's presence
1|could no more intimidate him than Rostov's, or a sergeant major's with
1|the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant
1|major or Napoleon could deprive him of.
1|
1|So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the
1|orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the
1|Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrushka screwed
1|up his eyes and considered.
1|
1|In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see
1|cunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.
1|
1|"It's like this," he said thoughtfully, "if there's a battle soon,
1|yours will win. That's right. But if three days pass, then after that,
1|well, then that same battle will not soon be over."
1|
1|Lelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon
1|thus: "If a battle takes place within the next three days the French
1|will win, but if later, God knows what will happen." Napoleon did
1|not smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, and he
1|ordered these words to be repeated.
1|
1|Lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending
1|not to know who Napoleon was, added:
1|
1|"We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in
1|the world, but we are a different matter..."--without knowing why or
1|how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.
1|
1|The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase,
1|and Bonaparte smiled. "The young Cossack made his mighty
1|interlocutor smile," says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence,
1|Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news
1|that he was talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who
1|had written his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would
1|affect this enfant du Don.*
1|
1|
1|*"Child of the Don."
1|
1|
1|The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka.
1|
1|Lavrushka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and
1|that Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new
1|masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his
1|eyes wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken
1|to be whipped. "As soon as Napoleon's interpreter had spoken," says
1|Thiers, "the Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word,
1|but rode on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached
1|him across the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly
1|arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration.
1|Napoleon, after making the Cossack a present, had him set free like
1|a bird restored to its native fields."
1|
1|Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his
1|imagination, and "the bird restored to its native fields" galloped
1|to our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but
1|that he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place
1|he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth
1|telling. He found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating
1|with Platov's detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas
1|Rostov, quartered at Yankovo. Rostov was just mounting to go for a
1|ride round the neighboring villages with Ilyin; he let Lavrushka
1|have another horse and took him along with him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew
1|supposed.
1|
1|After the return of Alpatych from Smolensk the old prince suddenly
1|seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be
1|called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the
1|commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at
1|Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the
1|commander in chief's discretion to take measures or not for the
1|defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia's oldest generals would
1|be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would
1|remain at Bald Hills.
1|
1|But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the
1|departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to
1|Bogucharovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her
1|father's feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy,
1|could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in
1|her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her
1|father's fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every
1|injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told
1|her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had
1|harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life
1|to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her
1|that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared
1|that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to
1|dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as she had
1|feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to
1|let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in
1|the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had
1|not gone away.
1|
1|The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned
1|his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His
1|caleche was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the
1|house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden
1|to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window
1|listening to his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly
1|several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces.
1|
1|Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path,
1|and into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were
1|moving toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by
1|the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
1|decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
1|fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
1|could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see
1|was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
1|of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his
1|helpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out
1|what he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on
1|the very couch he had so feared of late.
1|
1|The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said
1|that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.
1|
1|It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and
1|next day they moved the prince to Bogucharovo, the doctor accompanying
1|him.
1|
1|By the time they reached Bogucharovo, Dessalles and the little
1|prince had already left for Moscow.
1|
1|For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the
1|new house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo, ever in the same
1|state, getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay
1|like a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and
1|lips twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood
1|what was going on around him or not. One thing was certain--that he
1|was suffering and wished to say something. But what it was, no one
1|could tell: it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man,
1|or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
1|
1|The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was
1|due to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell
1|her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his
1|restlessness confirmed her opinion.
1|
1|He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was
1|no hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not
1|do to let him die on the road. "Would it not be better if the end
1|did come, the very end?" Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and
1|day, hardly sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say,
1|often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but
1|wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end.
1|
1|Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet
1|there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that
1|since her father's illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed
1|with him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires
1|and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened.
1|Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years--thoughts of a life
1|free from the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and
1|of family happiness--floated continually in her imagination like
1|temptations of the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions
1|continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now,
1|after that. These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew
1|it. She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she
1|tried to pray. She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons,
1|repeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt
1|that a different world had now taken possession of her--the life of
1|a world of strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual
1|world in which till now she had been confined and in which her
1|greatest comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not
1|weep, and worldly cares took possession of her.
1|
1|It was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo. News of the
1|approach of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten
1|miles from Bogucharovo, a homestead had been looted by French
1|marauders.
1|
1|The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the
1|provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary
1|to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of
1|the rural police having come to Bogucharovo urged the same thing,
1|saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that
1|French proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the
1|princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could
1|not answer for the consequences.
1|
1|The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of
1|preparation and giving orders, for which everyone came to her,
1|occupied her all day. She spent the night of the fourteenth as
1|usual, without undressing, in the room next to the one where the
1|prince lay. Several times, waking up, she heard his groans and
1|muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of Tikhon and the
1|doctor when they turned him over. Several times she listened at the
1|door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than
1|usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not sleep and
1|several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter but
1|not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw
1|and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to
1|him. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look
1|she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in
1|during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.
1|
1|But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of
1|losing him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and
1|act of his found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid
1|these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her
1|imagination: thoughts of how things would be after his death, and
1|how her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove these
1|thoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he became quiet and she
1|fell asleep.
1|
1|She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed
1|her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father's illness.
1|On waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and,
1|hearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were
1|still the same.
1|
1|"But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!"
1|she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.
1|
1|She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In
1|front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being
1|packed into the vehicles.
1|
1|It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch,
1|still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her
1|thoughts before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and
1|went out to her.
1|
1|"He is a little better today," said he. "I was looking for you.
1|One can make out something of what he is saying. His head is
1|clearer. Come in, he is asking for you..."
1|
1|Princess Mary's heart beat so violently at this news that she grew
1|pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him,
1|talk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was
1|overflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment
1|of joy and terror.
1|
1|"Come," said the doctor.
1|
1|Princess Mary entered her father's room and went up to his bed. He
1|was lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with
1|their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed
1|straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips
1|motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His
1|face seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown
1|smaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand
1|pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting
1|for her to come. He twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered
1|angrily.
1|
1|She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her.
1|When she changed her position so that his left eye could see her
1|face he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds.
1|Then his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak,
1|gazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might
1|not understand.
1|
1|Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic
1|efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
1|difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said
1|something, repeating the same words several times. She could not
1|understand them, but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly
1|repeated the words he uttered.
1|
1|"Mmm...ar...ate...ate..." he repeated several times.
1|
1|It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor
1|thought he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: "Mary, are
1|you afraid?" The prince shook his head, again repeated the same
1|sounds.
1|
1|"My mind, my mind aches?" questioned Princess Mary.
1|
1|He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and
1|began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to
1|find the right place for it.
1|
1|"Always thoughts... about you... thoughts..." he then uttered much
1|more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being
1|understood.
1|
1|Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide
1|her sobs and tears.
1|
1|He moved his hand over her hair.
1|
1|"I have been calling you all night..." he brought out.
1|
1|"If only I had known..." she said through her tears. "I was afraid
1|to come in."
1|
1|He pressed her hand.
1|
1|"Weren't you asleep?"
1|
1|"No, I did not sleep," said Princess Mary, shaking her head.
1|
1|Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself
1|as he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed
1|to move with difficulty.
1|
1|"Dear one... Dearest..." Princess Mary could not quite make out what
1|he had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a
1|tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before. "Why
1|didn't you come in?"
1|
1|"And I was wishing for his death!" thought Princess Mary.
1|
1|He was silent awhile.
1|
1|"Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!...
1|thank you!... forgive!... thank you!..." and tears began to flow
1|from his eyes. "Call Andrew!" he said suddenly, and a childish,
1|timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.
1|
1|He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least
1|it seemed to Princess Mary.
1|
1|"I have a letter from him," she replied.
1|
1|He glanced at her with timid surprise.
1|
1|"Where is he?"
1|
1|"He's with the army, Father, at Smolensk."
1|
1|He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in
1|answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood
1|and remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
1|
1|"Yes," he said, softly and distinctly. "Russia has perished. They've
1|destroyed her."
1|
1|And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes.
1|Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she
1|gazed at his face.
1|
1|Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes,
1|and Tikhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.
1|
1|Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them
1|could understand for a long time, till at last Tikhon understood and
1|repeated it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in
1|the mood in which he had just been speaking. She thought he was
1|speaking of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson,
1|or of his own death, and so she could not guess his words.
1|
1|"Put on your white dress. I like it," was what he said.
1|
1|Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the
1|doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and
1|trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left
1|the room the prince again began speaking about his son, about the war,
1|and about the Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his
1|hoarse voice, and then he had a second and final stroke.
1|
1|Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot
1|and sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel
1|nothing, except passionate love for her father, love such as she
1|thought she had never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing
1|into the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues of young
1|lime trees Prince Andrew had planted.
1|
1|"Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end
1|quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me?
1|What use will peace be when he is no longer here?" Princess Mary
1|murmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her
1|hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs.
1|
1|When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her
1|again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne--who had remained
1|at Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it--coming toward her with
1|a stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district,
1|who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for
1|her prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding
1|him; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with
1|him. Then, excusing herself, she went to the door of the old
1|prince's room. The doctor came out with an agitated face and said
1|she could not enter.
1|
1|"Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!"
1|
1|She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot
1|of the slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know
1|how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a
1|woman's footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyasha
1|her maid, who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped
1|suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress.
1|
1|"Please come, Princess... The Prince," said Dunyasha in a breaking
1|voice.
1|
1|"Immediately, I'm coming, I'm coming!" replied the princess
1|hurriedly, not giving Dunyasha time to finish what she was saying, and
1|trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.
1|
1|"Princess, it's God's will! You must be prepared for everything,"
1|said the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.
1|
1|"Let me alone; it's not true!" she cried angrily to him.
1|
1|The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her
1|father's door. "Why are these people with frightened faces stopping
1|me? I don't want any of them! And what are they doing here?" she
1|thought. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that
1|previously darkened room startled her. In the room were her nurse
1|and other women. They all drew back from the bed, making way for
1|her. He was still lying on the bed as before, but the stern expression
1|of his quiet face made Princess Mary stop short on the threshold.
1|
1|"No, he's not dead--it's impossible!" she told herself and
1|approached him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed
1|her lips to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force
1|of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly
1|and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before
1|her. "No, he is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something
1|unfamiliar and hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent
1|mystery!" And hiding her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into
1|the arms of the doctor, who held her up.
1|
1|
1|In the presence of Tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had
1|been the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth
1|should not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied
1|together the legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed
1|him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little
1|body on a table. Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but
1|it all got done as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were
1|burning round his coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was
1|strewn with sprays of juniper, a printed band was tucked in under
1|his shriveled head, and in a corner of the room sat a chanter
1|reading the psalms.
1|
1|Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the
1|inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
1|the coffin--the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women--and all
1|with fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and
1|kissed the old prince's cold and stiffened hand.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Until Prince Andrew settled in Bogucharovo its owners had always
1|been absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character
1|from those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress,
1|and disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used
1|to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to
1|Bald Hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches,
1|but he disliked them for their boorishness.
1|
1|Prince Andrew's last stay at Bogucharovo, when he introduced
1|hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to
1|pay, had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary
1|strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called
1|boorishness. Various obscure rumors were always current among them: at
1|one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at
1|another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; then
1|of some proclamation of the Tsar's and of an oath to the Tsar Paul
1|in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been
1|granted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of Peter
1|Fedorovich's return to the throne in seven years' time, when
1|everything would be made free and so "simple" that there would be no
1|restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were
1|connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of
1|Antichrist, the end of the world, and "pure freedom."
1|
1|In the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging to
1|the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work
1|where they pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the
1|neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in
1|the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents
1|in the life of the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are
1|so baffling to contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly
1|noticeable than among others. One instance, which had occurred some
1|twenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to emigrate
1|to some unknown "warm rivers." Hundreds of peasants, among them the
1|Bogucharovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in
1|whole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere
1|beyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to
1|the southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off
1|in caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or
1|walked toward the "warm rivers." Many of them were punished, some sent
1|to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of
1|their own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it
1|had sprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still
1|existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest
1|themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time
1|simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in
1|close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents
1|were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.
1|
1|Alpatych, who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old
1|prince's death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that
1|contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where
1|over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and
1|leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the
1|peasants in the steppe region round Bogucharovo were, it was
1|rumored, in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that
1|passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learned from
1|domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great
1|influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving
1|a government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks
1|were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not harm
1|them. Alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant
1|had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which was occupied
1|by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would
1|be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid
1|for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought
1|from Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that
1|they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.
1|
1|More important still, Alpatych learned that on the morning of the
1|very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the
1|princess' luggage from Bogucharovo, there had been a village meeting
1|at which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no
1|time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince's death,
1|the Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary's leaving at once, as it was
1|becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he
1|could not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of
1|the day the old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return
1|next day for the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he
1|received tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had
1|barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.
1|
1|For some thirty years Bogucharovo had been managed by the village
1|Elder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive "Dronushka."
1|
1|Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants
1|who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged
1|till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a
1|tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.
1|
1|Soon after the migration to the "warm rivers," in which he had taken
1|part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of
1|Bogucharovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for
1|twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their
1|master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the
1|steward respected him and jestingly called him "the Minister."
1|During the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill,
1|never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the
1|least fatigue, and though he could not read he had never forgotten a
1|single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of
1|the endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of
1|the whole corn crop on any single acre of the Bogucharovo fields.
1|
1|Alpatych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for
1|his Dron on the day of the prince's funeral and told him to have
1|twelve horses got ready for the princess' carriages and eighteen carts
1|for the things to be removed from Bogucharovo. Though the peasants
1|paid quitrent, Alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about
1|complying with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty
1|households at work in Bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do.
1|But on hearing the order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent.
1|Alpatych named certain peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take
1|the carts.
1|
1|Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.
1|Alpatych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no
1|horses available: some horses were carting for the government,
1|others were too weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It
1|seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages, much less
1|for the carting.
1|
1|Alpatych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a
1|model village Elder, so Alpatych had not managed the prince's
1|estates for twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in
1|the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts
1|of those he dealt with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood
1|that his answers did not express his personal views but the general
1|mood of the Bogucharovo commune, by which the Elder had already been
1|carried away. But he also knew that Dron, who had acquired property
1|and was hated by the commune, must be hesitating between the two
1|camps: the masters' and the serfs'. He noticed this hesitation in
1|Dron's look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him.
1|
1|"Now just listen, Dronushka," said he. "Don't talk nonsense to me.
1|His excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the
1|people away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order
1|from the Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar.
1|Do you hear?"
1|
1|"I hear," Dron answered without lifting his eyes.
1|
1|Alpatych was not satisfied with this reply.
1|
1|"Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!" he said, shaking his head.
1|
1|"The power is in your hands," Dron rejoined sadly.
1|
1|"Eh, Dron, drop it!" Alpatych repeated, withdrawing his hand from
1|his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron's feet. "I can
1|see through you and three yards into the ground under you," he
1|continued, gazing at the floor in front of Dron.
1|
1|Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpatych and again
1|lowered his eyes.
1|
1|"You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave
1|their homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow
1|morning for the princess' things. And don't go to any meeting
1|yourself, do you hear?"
1|
1|Dron suddenly fell on his knees.
1|
1|"Yakov Alpatych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge
1|me, for Christ's sake!"
1|
1|"Stop that!" cried Alpatych sternly. "I see through you and three
1|yards under you," he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping,
1|his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that
1|he had been able to retain the old prince's favor for twenty years had
1|long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the
1|power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute
1|of wizards.
1|
1|Dron got up and was about to say something, but Alpatych interrupted
1|him.
1|
1|"What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you
1|thinking of, eh?"
1|
1|"What am I to do with the people?" said Dron. "They're quite
1|beside themselves; I have already told them..."
1|
1|"'Told them,' I dare say!" said Alpatych. "Are they drinking?" he
1|asked abruptly.
1|
1|"Quite beside themselves, Yakov Alpatych; they've fetched another
1|barrel."
1|
1|"Well, then, listen! I'll go to the police officer, and you tell
1|them so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got
1|ready."
1|
1|"I understand."
1|
1|Alpatych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long
1|time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no
1|suspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive "I
1|understand" from Dron, Alpatych contented himself with that, though he
1|not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of
1|troops the carts would not be forthcoming.
1|
1|And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided.
1|In the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being
1|held, which decided that the horses should be driven out into the
1|woods and the carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of
1|this to the princess, Alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the
1|carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready
1|for the princess' carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police
1|authorities.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|After her father's funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room
1|and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpatych
1|was asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk
1|with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she
1|had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not
1|mean to go away and begged to be left in peace.
1|
1|The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward.
1|She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons
1|of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her
1|confused thoughts were centered on one subject--the irrevocability
1|of death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not
1|suspected, but which had shown itself during her father's illness. She
1|wished to pray but did not dare to, dared not in her present state
1|of mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time in that
1|position.
1|
1|The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting
1|rays shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of
1|the morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of
1|her thoughts suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed
1|her hair, got up, and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the
1|freshness of the clear but windy evening.
1|
1|"Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will
1|hinder you," she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her
1|head fall on the window sill.
1|
1|Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden
1|and kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a
1|black dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary,
1|sighed, kissed her, and immediately began to cry. The princess
1|looked up at her. All their former disharmony and her own jealousy
1|recurred to her mind. But she remembered too how he had changed of
1|late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could not bear to see her,
1|thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches Princess Mary had
1|mentally addressed to her. "Besides, is it for me, for me who
1|desired his death, to condemn anyone?" she thought.
1|
1|Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but
1|who yet was dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry
1|for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry.
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that
1|hand, speaking of the princess' sorrow and making herself a partner in
1|it. She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess
1|allowed her to share her sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings
1|should sink into nothing but this great grief; that she felt herself
1|blameless in regard to everyone, and that he, from above, saw her
1|affection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not heeding her words
1|but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her
1|voice.
1|
1|"Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess," said Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne after a pause. "I understand that you could not, and cannot,
1|think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has
1|Alpatych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?" she asked.
1|
1|Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go
1|or where to. "Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it
1|not all the same?" she thought, and did not reply.
1|
1|"You know, chere Marie," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, "that we are
1|in danger--are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move
1|now. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God
1|knows..."
1|
1|Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she
1|was talking about.
1|
1|"Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now," she
1|said. "Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him....
1|Alpatych did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do
1|nothing, nothing, and don't want to...."
1|
1|"I've spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away
1|tomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay here," said
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne. "Because, you will agree, chere Marie, to fall
1|into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be
1|terrible."
1|
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not
1|printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau's, telling people
1|not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would
1|afford them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.
1|
1|"I think it would be best to appeal to that general," she continued,
1|"and I am sure that all due respect would be shown you."
1|
1|Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with
1|stifled sobs.
1|
1|"From whom did you get this?" she asked.
1|
1|"They probably recognized that I am French, by my name," replied
1|Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.
1|
1|Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window
1|and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been
1|Prince Andrew's study.
1|
1|"Dunyasha, send Alpatych, or Dronushka, or somebody to me!" she
1|said, "and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me," she
1|added, hearing Mademoiselle Bourienne's voice. "We must go at once, at
1|once!" she said, appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of
1|the French.
1|
1|"If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French!
1|That I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, asked General
1|Rameau for protection and accepted his favor!" This idea horrified
1|her, made her shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and
1|pride as she had never experienced before. All that was distressing,
1|and especially all that was humiliating, in her position rose
1|vividly to her mind. "They, the French, would settle in this house: M.
1|le General Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew's study and amuse himself
1|by looking through and reading his letters and papers. Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne would do the honors of Bogucharovo for him. I should be
1|given a small room as a favor, the soldiers would violate my
1|father's newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars, they would
1|tell me of their victories over the Russians, and would pretend to
1|sympathize with my sorrow..." thought Princess Mary, not thinking
1|her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her
1|brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what
1|happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead
1|father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their
1|thoughts and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what
1|they would have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into
1|Prince Andrew's study, trying to enter completely into his ideas,
1|and considered her position.
1|
1|The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her
1|father's death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously
1|unknown force and took possession of her.
1|
1|Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael
1|Ivanovich and now for Tikhon or Dron. Dunyasha, the nurse, and the
1|other maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne's
1|statement was correct. Alpatych was not at home, he had gone to the
1|police. Neither could the architect Michael Ivanovich, who on being
1|sent for came in with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With
1|just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had
1|been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of
1|his own, he now replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite
1|could be got from his answers. The old valet Tikhon, with sunken,
1|emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief, replied:
1|"Yes, Princess" to all Princess Mary's questions and hardly
1|refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.
1|
1|At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a
1|deep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.
1|
1|Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of
1|him.
1|
1|"Dronushka," she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dronushka who
1|always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to
1|the fair at Vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her,
1|"Dronushka, now since our misfortune..." she began, but could not go
1|on.
1|
1|"We are all in God's hands," said he, with a sigh.
1|
1|They were silent for a while.
1|
1|"Dronushka, Alpatych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to
1|turn to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can't even go away?"
1|
1|"Why shouldn't you go away, your excellency? You can go," said Dron.
1|
1|"I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend,
1|I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go
1|away tonight or early tomorrow morning."
1|
1|Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: "There are
1|no horses; I told Yakov Alpatych so."
1|
1|"Why are there none?" asked the princess.
1|
1|"It's all God's scourge," said Dron. "What horses we had have been
1|taken for the army or have died--this is such a year! It's not a
1|case of feeding horses--we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some
1|go three days without eating. We've nothing, we've been ruined."
1|
1|Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.
1|
1|"The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?" she asked.
1|
1|"They're dying of hunger," said Dron. "It's not a case of carting."
1|
1|"But why didn't you tell me, Dronushka? Isn't it possible to help
1|them? I'll do all I can...."
1|
1|To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such
1|sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor,
1|and the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard
1|vaguely that there was such a thing as "landlord's corn" which was
1|sometimes given to the peasants. She also knew that neither her father
1|nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need, she only
1|feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of
1|the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares presented
1|themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief.
1|She began asking Dron about the peasants' needs and what there was
1|in Bogucharovo that belonged to the landlord.
1|
1|"But we have grain belonging to my brother?" she said.
1|
1|"The landlord's grain is all safe," replied Dron proudly. "Our
1|prince did not order it to be sold."
1|
1|"Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you
1|leave in my brother's name," said she.
1|
1|Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.
1|
1|"Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all.
1|I give this order in my brother's name; and tell them that what is
1|ours is theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so."
1|
1|Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.
1|
1|"Discharge me, little mother, for God's sake! Order the keys to be
1|taken from me," said he. "I have served twenty-three years and have
1|done no wrong. Discharge me, for God's sake!"
1|
1|Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
1|asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his
1|devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
1|peasants.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|An hour later Dunyasha came to tell the princess that Dron had come,
1|and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess'
1|order and wished to have word with their mistress.
1|
1|"But I never told them to come," said Princess Mary. "I only told
1|Dron to let them have the grain."
1|
1|"Only, for God's sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and
1|don't go out to them. It's all a trick," said Dunyasha, "and when
1|Yakov Alpatych returns let us get away... and please don't..."
1|
1|"What is a trick?" asked Princess Mary in surprise.
1|
1|"I know it is, only listen to me for God's sake! Ask nurse too. They
1|say they don't agree to leave Bogucharovo as you ordered."
1|
1|"You're making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,"
1|said Princess Mary. "Call Dronushka."
1|
1|Dron came and confirmed Dunyasha's words; the peasants had come by
1|the princess' order.
1|
1|"But I never sent for them," declared the princess. "You must have
1|given my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the
1|grain."
1|
1|Dron only sighed in reply.
1|
1|"If you order it they will go away," said he.
1|
1|"No, no. I'll go out to them," said Princess Mary, and in spite of
1|the nurse's and Dunyasha's protests she went out into the porch; Dron,
1|Dunyasha, the nurse, and Michael Ivanovich following her.
1|
1|"They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to
1|remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
1|French," thought Princess Mary. "I will offer them monthly rations and
1|housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in
1|my place," she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the
1|crowd standing on the pasture by the barn.
1|
1|The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their
1|hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt,
1|came close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were
1|fixed on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could
1|not distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them
1|all at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she
1|represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she
1|boldly began her speech.
1|
1|"I am very glad you have come," she said without raising her eyes,
1|and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. "Dronushka
1|tells me that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune,
1|and I shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because
1|it is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving
1|you everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all
1|our grain, so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been
1|told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here--that is not
1|true. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our
1|estate near Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there
1|you shall want for nothing. You shall be given food and lodging."
1|
1|The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.
1|
1|"I am not doing this on my own account," she continued, "I do it
1|in the name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my
1|brother and his son."
1|
1|Again she paused. No one broke the silence.
1|
1|"Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that
1|is mine is yours," she concluded, scanning the faces before her.
1|
1|All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She
1|could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or
1|apprehension and distrust--but the expression on all the faces was
1|identical.
1|
1|"We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won't do for us to
1|take the landlord's grain," said a voice at the back of the crowd.
1|
1|"But why not?" asked the princess.
1|
1|No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd,
1|found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped.
1|
1|"But why don't you want to take it?" she asked again.
1|
1|No one answered.
1|
1|The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
1|someone's eye.
1|
1|"Why don't you speak?" she inquired of a very old man who stood just
1|in front of her leaning on his stick. "If you think something more
1|is wanted, tell me! I will do anything," said she, catching his eye.
1|
1|But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:
1|
1|"Why should we agree? We don't want the grain."
1|
1|"Why should we give up everything? We don't agree. Don't agree....
1|We are sorry for you, but we're not willing. Go away yourself,
1|alone..." came from various sides of the crowd.
1|
1|And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical
1|expression, though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity
1|or gratitude, but of angry resolve.
1|
1|"But you can't have understood me," said Princess Mary with a sad
1|smile. "Why don't you want to go? I promise to house and feed you,
1|while here the enemy would ruin you..."
1|
1|But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.
1|
1|"We're not willing. Let them ruin us! We won't take your grain. We
1|don't agree."
1|
1|Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone's eye, but not a single
1|eye in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying
1|to avoid her look. She felt strange and awkward.
1|
1|"Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your
1|houses and go into bondage! I dare say! 'I'll give you grain, indeed!'
1|she says," voices in the crowd were heard saying.
1|
1|With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the
1|house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for
1|her departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone
1|with her own thoughts.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of
1|her room hearing the sound of the peasants' voices that reached her
1|from the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt
1|that she could not understand them however much she might think
1|about them. She thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after
1|the break caused by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to
1|the past. Now she could remember it and weep or pray.
1|
1|After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh.
1|Toward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full
1|moon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist
1|began to rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.
1|
1|Pictures of the near past--her father's illness and last moments--rose
1|one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now
1|lingered over these images, repelling with horror only the last one,
1|the picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate
1|even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these
1|pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail
1|that they seemed now present, now past, and now future.
1|
1|She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
1|being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,
1|muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray
1|eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.
1|
1|"Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,"
1|she thought. "He had always thought what he said then." And she
1|recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the
1|last stroke, when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at
1|home against his will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs
1|on tiptoe, and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept
1|that night had listened at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he
1|was saying something to Tikhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm
1|nights and of the Empress. Evidently he had wanted to talk. "And why
1|didn't he call me? Why didn't he let me be there instead of Tikhon?"
1|Princess Mary had thought and thought again now. "Now he will never
1|tell anyone what he had in his soul. Never will that moment return for
1|him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say, and not
1|Tikhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn't I enter
1|the room?" she thought. "Perhaps he would then have said to me what he
1|said the day he died. While talking to Tikhon he asked about me twice.
1|He wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door. It
1|was sad and painful for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand
1|him. I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were
1|alive--he had forgotten she was dead--and Tikhon reminded him that she
1|was no more, and he shouted, 'Fool!' He was greatly depressed. From
1|behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly
1|exclaimed, 'My God!' Why didn't I go in then? What could he have
1|done to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps he would then have
1|been comforted and would have said that word to me." And Princess Mary
1|uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of
1|his death. "Dear-est!" she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears
1|that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the
1|face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen
1|at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first
1|time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details, when she
1|stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.
1|
1|"Dear-est!" she repeated again.
1|
1|"What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking
1|now?" This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer
1|she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as
1|he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief.
1|And the horror that had seized her when she touched him and
1|convinced herself that that was not he, but something mysterious and
1|horrible, seized her again. She tried to think of something else and
1|to pray, but could do neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the
1|moonlight and the shadows, expecting every moment to see his dead
1|face, and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within
1|it held her fast.
1|
1|"Dunyasha," she whispered. "Dunyasha!" she screamed wildly, and
1|tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants'
1|quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running
1|toward her.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|On the seventeenth of August Rostov and Ilyin, accompanied by
1|Lavrushka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar
1|orderly, left their quarters at Yankovo, ten miles from Bogucharovo,
1|and went for a ride--to try a new horse Ilyin had bought and to find
1|out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages.
1|
1|For the last three days Bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile
1|armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to
1|it as for the French vanguard; Rostov, as a careful squadron
1|commander, wished to take such provisions as remained at Bogucharovo
1|before the French could get them.
1|
1|Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods. On the way to
1|Bogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where
1|they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they
1|questioned Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and
1|raced one another to try Ilyin's horse.
1|
1|Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property
1|of that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister.
1|
1|Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
1|incline before reaching Bogucharovo, and Rostov, outstripping Ilyin,
1|was the first to gallop into the village street.
1|
1|"You're first!" cried Ilyin, flushed.
1|
1|"Yes, always first both on the grassland and here," answered Rostov,
1|stroking his heated Donets horse.
1|
1|"And I'd have won on my Frenchy, your excellency," said Lavrushka
1|from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, "only I didn't wish to
1|mortify you."
1|
1|They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants
1|was standing.
1|
1|Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals
1|without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled
1|faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling,
1|staggering, and singing some incoherent song, and approached the
1|officers.
1|
1|"Fine fellows!" said Rostov laughing. "Is there any hay here?"
1|
1|"And how like one another," said Ilyin.
1|
1|"A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!" sang one of the peasants with a
1|blissful smile.
1|
1|One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov.
1|
1|"Who do you belong to?" he asked.
1|
1|"The French," replied Ilyin jestingly, "and here is Napoleon
1|himself"--and he pointed to Lavrushka.
1|
1|"Then you are Russians?" the peasant asked again.
1|
1|"And is there a large force of you here?" said another, a short man,
1|coming up.
1|
1|"Very large," answered Rostov. "But why have you collected here?" he
1|added. "Is it a holiday?"
1|
1|"The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,"
1|replied the peasant, moving away.
1|
1|At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women
1|and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.
1|
1|"The one in pink is mine, so keep off!" said Ilyin on seeing
1|Dunyasha running resolutely toward him.
1|
1|"She'll be ours!" said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking.
1|
1|"What do you want, my pretty?" said Ilyin with a smile.
1|
1|"The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name."
1|
1|"This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am your humble
1|servant."
1|
1|"Co-o-om-pa-ny!" roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
1|he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl. Following Dunyasha, Alpatych
1|advanced to Rostov, having bared his head while still at a distance.
1|
1|"May I make bold to trouble your honor?" said he respectfully, but
1|with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with
1|a hand thrust into his bosom. "My mistress, daughter of General in
1|Chief Prince Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this
1|month, finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of
1|these people"--he pointed to the peasants--"asks you to come up to the
1|house.... Won't you, please, ride on a little farther," said
1|Alpatych with a melancholy smile, "as it is not convenient in the
1|presence of...?" He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to
1|him as horseflies to a horse.
1|
1|"Ah!... Alpatych... Ah, Yakov Alpatych... Grand! Forgive us for
1|Christ's sake, eh?" said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.
1|
1|Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.
1|
1|"Or perhaps they amuse your honor?" remarked Alpatych with a staid
1|air, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.
1|
1|"No, there's not much to be amused at here," said Rostov, and rode
1|on a little way. "What's the matter?" he asked.
1|
1|"I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here
1|don't wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to
1|unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up
1|since morning, her excellency cannot get away."
1|
1|"Impossible!" exclaimed Rostov.
1|
1|"I have the honor to report to you the actual truth," said Alpatych.
1|
1|Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed
1|Alpatych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs.
1|It appeared that the princess' offer of corn to the peasants the
1|previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had
1|actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the
1|keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent
1|for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to
1|harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the
1|barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that
1|there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the
1|horses. Alpatych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was
1|chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the
1|crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that there was an
1|order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her
1|as before and obey her in everything.
1|
1|At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road,
1|Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her nurse, and the
1|maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the
1|cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran
1|away, and the women in the house began to wail.
1|
1|"Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!" exclaimed deeply moved
1|voices as Rostov passed through the anteroom.
1|
1|Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large
1|sitting room, when Rostov was shown in. She could not grasp who he was
1|and why he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his
1|Russian face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered
1|recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at him with
1|her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered
1|and trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately struck Rostov as a
1|romantic event. "A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the
1|mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me
1|here! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and
1|expression!" thought he as he looked at her and listened to her
1|timid story.
1|
1|When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day
1|after her father's funeral, her voiced trembled. She turned away,
1|and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him
1|to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There
1|were tears in Rostov's eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced
1|gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of
1|her face to be forgotten.
1|
1|"I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride
1|here and am able to show my readiness to serve you," said Rostov,
1|rising. "Go when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no
1|one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act
1|as your escort." And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal
1|blood, he moved toward the door.
1|
1|Rostov's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
1|consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to
1|take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.
1|
1|Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.
1|
1|"I am very, very grateful to you," she said in French, "but I hope
1|it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it." She
1|suddenly began to cry.
1|
1|"Excuse me!" she said.
1|
1|Rostov, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|"Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend--my pink one is delicious; her
1|name is Dunyasha...."
1|
1|But on glancing at Rostov's face Ilyin stopped short. He saw that
1|his hero and commander was following quite a different train of
1|thought.
1|
1|Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with
1|rapid steps to the village.
1|
1|"I'll show them; I'll give it to them, the brigands!" said he to
1|himself.
1|
1|Alpatych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up
1|with him with difficulty.
1|
1|"What decision have you been pleased to come to?" said he.
1|
1|Rostov stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned
1|on Alpatych.
1|
1|"Decision? What decision? Old dotard!..." cried he. "What have you
1|been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can't manage them?
1|You're a traitor yourself! I know you. I'll flay you all alive!..."
1|And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpatych and
1|went rapidly forward. Alpatych, mastering his offended feelings,
1|kept pace with Rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his
1|views. He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present
1|moment it would be imprudent to "overresist" them without an armed
1|force, and would it not be better first to send for the military?
1|
1|"I'll give them armed force... I'll 'overresist' them!" uttered
1|Rostov meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the
1|need to vent it.
1|
1|Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with
1|quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it
1|the more Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce
1|good results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed
1|when they saw Rostov's rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.
1|
1|After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone to see
1|the princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among
1|the crowd. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were
1|Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained.
1|Dron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and
1|others attacked their ex-Elder.
1|
1|"How many years have you been fattening on the commune?" Karp
1|shouted at him. "It's all one to you! You'll dig up your pot of
1|money and take it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether
1|our homes are ruined or not?"
1|
1|"We've been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their
1|homes or take away a single grain, and that's all about it!" cried
1|another.
1|
1|"It was your son's turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You
1|begrudged your lump of a son," a little old man suddenly began
1|attacking Dron--"and so they took my Vanka to be shaved for a soldier!
1|But we all have to die."
1|
1|"To be sure, we all have to die. I'm not against the commune,"
1|said Dron.
1|
1|"That's it--not against it! You've filled your belly...."
1|
1|The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostov, followed
1|by Ilyin, Lavrushka, and Alpatych, came up to the crowd, Karp,
1|thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to
1|the front. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew
1|closer together.
1|
1|"Who is your Elder here? Hey?" shouted Rostov, coming up to the
1|crowd with quick steps.
1|
1|"The Elder? What do you want with him?..." asked Karp.
1|
1|But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off
1|and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.
1|
1|"Caps off, traitors!" shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice. "Where's
1|the Elder?" he cried furiously.
1|
1|"The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakharych, you!" meek and
1|flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to
1|come off their heads.
1|
1|"We don't riot, we're following the orders," declared Karp, and at
1|that moment several voices began speaking together.
1|
1|"It's as the old men have decided--there's too many of you giving
1|orders."
1|
1|"Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!" cried Rostov unmeaningly
1|in a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. "Bind him, bind
1|him!" he shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka
1|and Alpatych.
1|
1|Lavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from
1|behind.
1|
1|"Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?" he called out.
1|
1|Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to
1|come and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began
1|taking off their belts.
1|
1|"Where's the Elder?" demanded Rostov in a loud voice.
1|
1|With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.
1|
1|"Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushka!" shouted Rostov, as if that
1|order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.
1|
1|And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his
1|own belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.
1|
1|"And you all listen to me!" said Rostov to the peasants. "Be off
1|to your houses at once, and don't let one of your voices be heard!"
1|
1|"Why, we've not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness.
1|It's all nonsense... I said then that it was not in order," voices
1|were heard bickering with one another.
1|
1|"There! What did I say?" said Alpatych, coming into his own again.
1|"It's wrong, lads!"
1|
1| "All our stupidity, Yakov Alpatych," came the answers, and the
1|crowd began at once to disperse through the village.
1|
1|The two bound men were led off to the master's house. The two
1|drunken peasants followed them.
1|
1|"Aye, when I look at you!..." said one of them to Karp.
1|
1|"How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking
1|of, you fool?" added the other--"A real fool!"
1|
1|Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
1|Bogucharovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the
1|proprietor's goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron,
1|liberated at Princess Mary's wish from the cupboard where he had
1|been confined, was standing in the yard directing the men.
1|
1|"Don't put it in so carelessly," said one of the peasants, a man
1|with a round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. "You know
1|it has cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under
1|the cord where it'll get rubbed? I don't like that way of doing
1|things. Let it all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put
1|it under the bast matting and cover it with hay--that's the way!"
1|
1|"Eh, books, books!" said another peasant, bringing out Prince
1|Andrew's library cupboards. "Don't catch up against it! It's heavy,
1|lads--solid books."
1|
1|"Yes, they worked all day and didn't play!" remarked the tall,
1|round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the
1|dictionaries that were on the top.
1|
1|
1|Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostov did not go back
1|to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure.
1|When her carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied
1|her eight miles from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our
1|troops. At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave of her, for
1|the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.
1|
1|"How can you speak so!" he blushingly replied to Princess Mary's
1|expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had
1|occurred. "Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had
1|only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,"
1|said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. "I am
1|only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.
1|Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to
1|meet you again in happier circumstances. If you don't want to make
1|me blush, please don't thank me!"
1|
1|But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him
1|with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and
1|tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him
1|for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been
1|there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the
1|French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger
1|to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty
1|and noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His
1|kind, honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had
1|begun to cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.
1|
1|When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt
1|her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the
1|strange question presented itself to her: did she love him?
1|
1|On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess' position
1|was not a cheerful one, Dunyasha, who went with her in the carriage,
1|more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window
1|and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.
1|
1|"Well, supposing I do love him?" thought Princess Mary.
1|
1|Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen
1|in love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted
1|herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she
1|would not be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she
1|continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had
1|fallen in love for the first and last time in her life.
1|
1|Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his
1|words, happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those
1|moments that Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the
1|carriage window.
1|
1|"Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo, and at that very
1|moment?" thought Princess Mary. "And that caused his sister to
1|refuse my brother?" And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of
1|Providence.
1|
1|The impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable one.
1|To remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of
1|his adventure at Bogucharovo, rallied him on having gone to look for
1|hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he
1|grew angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the
1|gentle Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous
1|fortune, had against his will more than once entered his head. For
1|himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by
1|marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be
1|able to put his father's affairs in order, and would even--he felt
1|it--ensure Princess Mary's happiness.
1|
1|But Sonya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostov grew angry
1|when he was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|On receiving command of the armies Kutuzov remembered Prince
1|Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters.
1|
1|Prince Andrew arrived at Tsarevo-Zaymishche on the very day and at
1|the very hour that Kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first
1|time. He stopped in the village at the priest's house in front of
1|which stood the commander in chief's carriage, and he sat down on
1|the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now
1|called Kutuzov. From the field beyond the village came now sounds of
1|regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting "Hurrah!" to
1|the new commander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo,
1|stood near by, some ten paces from Prince Andrew, availing
1|themselves of Kutuzov's absence and of the fine weather. A short,
1|swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and
1|whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew,
1|inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and
1|whether he would soon be back.
1|
1|Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness'
1|staff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned
1|to a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a
1|commander in chief's orderly speaks to officers, replied:
1|
1|"What? His Serene Highness? I expect he'll be here soon. What do you
1|want?"
1|
1|The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
1|orderly's tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and
1|approached Bolkonski with a slight bow. Bolkonski made room for him on
1|the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.
1|
1|"You're also waiting for the commander in chief?" said he. "They say
1|he weceives evewyone, thank God!... It's awful with those sausage
1|eaters! Ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now
1|p'waps Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what
1|was happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in
1|the campaign?" he asked.
1|
1|"I had the pleasure," replied Prince Andrew, "not only of taking
1|part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear--not
1|to mention the estate and home of my birth--my father, who died of
1|grief. I belong to the province of Smolensk."
1|
1|"Ah? You're Pwince Bolkonski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance!
1|I'm Lieutenant Colonel Denisov, better known as 'Vaska,'" said
1|Denisov, pressing Prince Andrew's hand and looking into his face
1|with a particularly kindly attention. "Yes, I heard," said he
1|sympathetically, and after a short pause added: "Yes, it's Scythian
1|warfare. It's all vewy well--only not for those who get it in the
1|neck. So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkonski?" He swayed his head. "Vewy
1|pleased, Pwince, to make your acquaintance!" he repeated again,
1|smiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince Andrew's hand.
1|
1|Prince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him of her
1|first suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to
1|those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which
1|still found place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and
1|very serious impressions--such as the retreat from Smolensk, his visit
1|to Bald Hills, and the recent news of his father's death--and had
1|experienced so many emotions, that for a long time past those memories
1|had not entered his mind, and now that they did, they did not act on
1|him with nearly their former strength. For Denisov, too, the
1|memories awakened by the name of Bolkonski belonged to a distant,
1|romantic past, when after supper and after Natasha's singing he had
1|proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was
1|doing. He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love
1|for Natasha, and passed at once to what now interested him
1|passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign he had
1|devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had
1|proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to
1|Kutuzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line of
1|operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or
1|concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the
1|French, we should attack their line of communication. He began
1|explaining his plan to Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"They can't hold all that line. It's impossible. I will undertake to
1|bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,
1|that's certain! There's only one way--guewilla warfare!"
1|
1|Denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to
1|Bolkonski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from
1|the army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with
1|music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held.
1|Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.
1|
1|"He's coming! He's coming!" shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.
1|
1|Bolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers
1|(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutuzov coming down
1|the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of
1|generals rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and
1|a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting, "Hurrah!"
1|
1|His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutuzov was
1|impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his
1|weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard's cap with a
1|red band and no peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to
1|the guard of honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing
1|decorations, who were giving him the salute, he looked at them
1|silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a
1|commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers
1|surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression, he
1|shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.
1|
1|"And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,
1|General," he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and
1|Denisov.
1|
1|"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" shouted those behind him.
1|
1|Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had grown still more
1|corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and
1|the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was
1|wearing the white Horse Guard's cap and a military overcoat with a
1|whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and
1|swayed limply on his brisk little horse.
1|
1|"Whew... whew... whew!" he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
1|yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man
1|who means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the
1|stirrup and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face
1|with the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned
1|on his knee, groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks
1|and adjutants who stood ready to assist him.
1|
1|He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes,
1|glanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved
1|with his waddling gait to the porch. "Whew... whew... whew!" he
1|whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old
1|men, it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by
1|Prince Andrew's face linked itself up with Kutuzov's remembrance of
1|his personality.
1|
1|"Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come
1|along..." said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the
1|porch which creaked under his weight.
1|
1|He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.
1|
1|"And how's your father?"
1|
1|"I received news of his death, yesterday," replied Prince Andrew
1|abruptly.
1|
1|Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then
1|took off his cap and crossed himself:
1|
1|"May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God's will be done to us all!" He
1|sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. "I
1|loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my
1|heart."
1|
1|He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for
1|some time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw
1|that Kutuzov's flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his
1|eyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise
1|himself.
1|
1|"Come! Come with me, we'll have a talk," said he.
1|
1|But at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by his superiors
1|than by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch,
1|despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him.
1|Kutuzov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly.
1|Denisov, having given his name, announced that he had to communicate
1|to his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their
1|country's welfare. Kutuzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his
1|hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded them across his stomach,
1|repeating the words: "For our country's welfare? Well, what is it?
1|Speak!" Denisov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see the color
1|rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly began to
1|expound his plan of cutting the enemy's lines of communication between
1|Smolensk and Vyazma. Denisov came from those parts and knew the
1|country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from
1|the strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutuzov looked down at
1|his own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut
1|as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from
1|that hut, while Denisov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under
1|his arm really did appear.
1|
1|"What?" said Kutuzov, in the midst of Denisov's explanations, "are
1|you ready so soon?"
1|
1|"Ready, your Serene Highness," replied the general.
1|
1|Kutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: "How is one man to
1|deal with it all?" and again listened to Denisov.
1|
1|"I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer," said Denisov,
1|"that I can bweak Napoleon's line of communication!"
1|
1|"What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich
1|Denisov?" asked Kutuzov, interrupting him.
1|
1|"He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness."
1|
1|"Ah, we were friends," said Kutuzov cheerfully. "All right, all
1|right, friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we'll have a talk."
1|
1|With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the
1|papers Konovnitsyn had brought him.
1|
1|"Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?" said the
1|general on duty in a discontented voice, "the plans must be examined
1|and several papers have to be signed."
1|
1|An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in
1|readiness within. But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that
1|room till he was disengaged. He made a grimace...
1|
1|"No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I'll
1|look at them here," said he. "Don't go away," he added, turning to
1|Prince Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general's
1|report.
1|
1|While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a
1|woman's voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door.
1|Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a
1|plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief
1|on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the
1|commander in chief. Kutuzov's adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew
1|that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was, and that she
1|intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt. "Her husband has
1|welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church, and she
1|intends to welcome him in the house.... She's very pretty," added
1|the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutuzov looked round. He was
1|listening to the general's report--which consisted chiefly of a
1|criticism of the position at Tsarevo-Zaymishche--as he had listened to
1|Denisov, and seven years previously had listened to the discussion
1|at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only because
1|he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them,
1|could not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general
1|could say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that
1|would be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to,
1|as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All
1|that Denisov had said was clever and to the point. What the general
1|was saying was even more clever and to the point, but it was evident
1|that Kutuzov despised knowledge and cleverness, and knew of
1|something else that would decide the matter--something independent
1|of cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the commander
1|in chief's face attentively, and the only expression he could see
1|there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the
1|feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe
1|propriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and
1|learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but despised
1|them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge--he
1|did not try to display any of these--but because of something else. He
1|despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The
1|only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report
1|referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report
1|the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the
1|recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by
1|the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation.
1|
1|After hearing the matter, Kutuzov smacked his lips together and
1|shook his head.
1|
1|"Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all,
1|my dear fellow," said he, "into the fire with all such things! Let
1|them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts' content. I don't
1|order it or allow it, but I don't exact compensation either. One can't
1|get on without it. 'When wood is chopped the chips will fly.'" He
1|looked at the paper again. "Oh, this German precision!" he muttered,
1|shaking his head.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|"Well, that's all!" said Kutuzov as he signed the last of the
1|documents, and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat
1|white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.
1|
1|The priest's wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had
1|after all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had
1|so long been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to
1|Kutuzov.
1|
1|He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and
1|said:
1|
1|"Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!"
1|
1|He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
1|dish for her. "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?" he asked,
1|moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest's wife
1|smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the
1|room. The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to
1|lunch with him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to
1|Kutuzov. He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same
1|unbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he
1|closed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife.
1|Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne
1|by Madame de Genlis.
1|
1|"Well, sit down, sit down here. Let's have a talk," said Kutuzov.
1|"It's sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a
1|father to you, a second father...."
1|
1|Prince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of his father's death, and
1|what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.
1|
1|"What... what they have brought us to!" Kutuzov suddenly cried in an
1|agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince
1|Andrew's story the condition Russia was in. "But give me time, give me
1|time!" he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue
1|this agitating conversation, and added: "I sent for you to keep you
1|with me."
1|
1|"I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the
1|staff," replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutuzov noticed.
1|
1|Kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him.
1|
1|"But above all," added Prince Andrew, "I have grown used to my
1|regiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I
1|should be sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being
1|with you, believe me..."
1|
1|A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutuzov's
1|podgy face. He cut Bolkonski short.
1|
1|"I am sorry, for I need you. But you're right, you're right! It's
1|not here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men
1|are not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be
1|advisers served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I
1|remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!" said Kutuzov, and
1|a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew's face at this
1|recollection.
1|
1|Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutuzov offered his cheek
1|to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man's
1|eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutuzov's tears came easily,
1|and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a
1|wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz
1|was both pleasant and flattering to him.
1|
1|"Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of
1|honor!" He paused. "I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to
1|send." And changing the subject, Kutuzov began to speak of the Turkish
1|war and the peace that had been concluded. "Yes, I have been much
1|blamed," he said, "both for that war and the peace... but everything
1|came at the right time. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre.*
1|And there were as many advisers there as here..." he went on,
1|returning to the subject of "advisers" which evidently occupied him.
1|"Ah, those advisers!" said he. "If we had listened to them all we
1|should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been
1|through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less
1|speed. Kamenski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed
1|fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture
1|a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not storming
1|and attacking but patience and time are wanted. Kamenski sent soldiers
1|to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more
1|fortresses than Kamenski and made them Turks eat horseflesh!" He swayed
1|his head. "And the French shall too, believe me," he went on,
1|growing warmer and beating his chest, "I'll make them eat horseflesh!"
1|And tears again dimmed his eyes.
1|
1|
1|*"Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait."
1|
1|
1|"But shan't we have to accept battle?" remarked Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"We shall if everybody wants it; it can't be helped.... But
1|believe me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two:
1|patience and time, they will do it all. But the advisers n'entendent
1|pas de cette oreille, voila le mal.* Some want a thing--others
1|don't. What's one to do?" he asked, evidently expecting an answer.
1|"Well, what do you want us to do?" he repeated and his eye shone
1|with a deep, shrewd look. "I'll tell you what to do," he continued, as
1|Prince Andrew still did not reply: "I will tell you what to do, and
1|what I do. Dans le doute, mon cher," he paused, "abstiens-toi"*[2]--he
1|articulated the French proverb deliberately.
1|
1|
1|*"Don't see it that way, that's the trouble."
1|
1|*[2] "When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing."
1|
1|
1|"Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I
1|share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor
1|a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything
1|come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy."
1|
1|Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter
1|had left the room Kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
1|unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
1|
1|Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but
1|after that interview with Kutuzov he went back to his regiment
1|reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to
1|whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all
1|personal motive in that old man--in whom there seemed to remain only
1|the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events
1|and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the
1|course of events--the more reassured he was that everything would be
1|as it should. "He will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not
1|devise or undertake anything," thought Prince Andrew, "but he will
1|hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place.
1|He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He
1|understands that there is something stronger and more important than
1|his own will--the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and
1|grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain
1|from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something
1|else. And above all," thought Prince Andrew, "one believes in him
1|because he's Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French
1|proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: 'What they have
1|brought us to!' and had a sob in it when he said he would 'make them
1|eat horseflesh!'"
1|
1|On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity
1|and general approval were founded with which, despite court
1|influences, the popular choice of Kutuzov as commander in chief was
1|received.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual
1|course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to
1|remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to
1|believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the
1|English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice
1|everything for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor
1|everyone had displayed during the Emperor's stay was the call for
1|contributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the
1|promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became
1|unavoidable.
1|
1|With the enemy's approach to Moscow, the Moscovites' view of their
1|situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even
1|more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger
1|approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices
1|that speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably
1|tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of
1|escaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too
1|depressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in
1|man's power to foresee everything and avert the general course of
1|events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till
1|it comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man
1|generally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So
1|it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people
1|had been as gay in Moscow as that year.
1|
1|Rostopchin's broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a
1|potman, and a Moscow burgher called Karpushka Chigirin, "who--having
1|been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub--heard
1|that Napoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the
1|French in very bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under
1|the sign of the eagle, began to address the assembled people," were
1|read and discussed, together with the latest of Vasili Lvovich
1|Pushkin's bouts rimes.
1|
1|In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these
1|broadsheets, and some liked the way Karpushka jeered at the French,
1|saying: "They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our
1|buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are
1|all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a
1|hayfork." Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and
1|vulgar. It was said that Rostopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and
1|even all foreigners from Moscow, and that there had been some spies
1|and agents of Napoleon among them; but this was told chiefly to
1|introduce Rostopchin's witty remark on that occasion. The foreigners
1|were deported to Nizhni by boat, and Rostopchin had said to them in
1|French: "Rentrez en vousmemes; entrez dans la barque, et n'en faites
1|pas une barque de Charon."* There was talk of all the government
1|offices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this
1|Shinshin's witticism was added--that for that alone Moscow ought to be
1|grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamonov's regiment would cost
1|him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezukhov had spent even
1|more on his, but that the best thing about Bezukhov's action was
1|that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his
1|regiment without charging anything for the show.
1|
1|
1|*"Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to make it a
1|barque of Charon."
1|
1|
1|"You don't spare anyone," said Julie Drubetskaya as she collected
1|and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed
1|fingers.
1|
1|Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a
1|farewell soiree.
1|
1|"Bezukhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What
1|pleasure is there to be so caustique?"
1|
1|"A forfeit!" cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie
1|called "mon chevalier," and who was going with her to Nizhni.
1|
1|In Julie's set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been
1|agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who
1|made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of
1|Voluntary Contributions.
1|
1|"Another forfeit for a Gallicism," said a Russian writer who was
1|present. "'What pleasure is there to be' is not Russian!"
1|
1|"You spare no one," continued Julie to the young man without heeding
1|the author's remark.
1|
1|"For caustique--I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay
1|again for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I
1|won't be responsible," she remarked, turning to the author: "I have
1|neither the money nor the time, like Prince Galitsyn, to engage a
1|master to teach me Russian!"
1|
1|"Ah, here he is!" she added. "Quand on... No, no," she said to the
1|militia officer, "you won't catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its
1|rays!" and she smiled amiably at Pierre. "We were just talking of
1|you," she said with the facility in lying natural to a society
1|woman. "We were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better
1|than Mamonov's."
1|
1|"Oh, don't talk to me of my regiment," replied Pierre, kissing his
1|hostess' hand and taking a seat beside her. "I am so sick of it."
1|
1|"You will, of course, command it yourself?" said Julie, directing
1|a sly, sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.
1|
1|The latter in Pierre's presence had ceased to be caustic, and his
1|face expressed perplexity as to what Julie's smile might mean. In
1|spite of his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre's personality
1|immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.
1|
1|"No," said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. "I
1|should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I
1|should hardly be able to climb onto a horse."
1|
1|Among those whom Julie's guests happened to choose to gossip about
1|were the Rostovs.
1|
1|"I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way," said Julie.
1|"And he is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The
1|Razumovskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it
1|drags on and on. He asks too much."
1|
1|"No, I think the sale will come off in a few days," said someone.
1|"Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now."
1|
1|"Why?" asked Julie. "You don't think Moscow is in danger?"
1|
1|"Then why are you leaving?"
1|
1|"I? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is
1|going: and besides--I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon."
1|
1|"Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen."
1|
1|"If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off
1|all his debts," said the militia officer, speaking of Rostov.
1|
1|"A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so
1|long in Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago.
1|Natalie is quite well again now, isn't she?" Julie asked Pierre with a
1|knowing smile.
1|
1|"They are waiting for their younger son," Pierre replied. "He joined
1|Obolenski's Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment
1|is being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my
1|regiment and are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave
1|long ago, but the countess won't on any account leave Moscow till
1|her son returns."
1|
1|"I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkharovs'. Natalie
1|has recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily
1|some people get over everything!"
1|
1|"Get over what?" inquired Pierre, looking displeased.
1|
1|Julie smiled.
1|
1|"You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de
1|Souza's novels."
1|
1|"What knights? What do you mean?" demanded Pierre, blushing.
1|
1|"Oh, come, my dear count! C'est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous
1|admire, ma parole d'honneur!"*
1|
1|
1|*"It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!"
1|
1|
1|"Forfeit, forfeit!" cried the militia officer.
1|
1|"All right, one can't talk--how tiresome!"
1|
1|"What is 'the talk of all Moscow'?" Pierre asked angrily, rising
1|to his feet.
1|
1|"Come now, Count, you know!"
1|
1|"I don't know anything about it," said Pierre.
1|
1|"I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always
1|more friendly with Vera--that dear Vera."
1|
1|"No, madame!" Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, "I have not
1|taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova's knight at all, and
1|have not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot
1|understand the cruelty..."
1|
1|"Qui s'excuse s'accuse,"* said Julie, smiling and waving the lint
1|triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the
1|subject. "Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkonskaya
1|arrived in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her
1|father?"
1|
1|
1|*"Who excuses himself, accuses himself."
1|
1|
1|"Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her," said
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"I spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their
1|estate near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew."
1|
1|"Well, and how is she?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is
1|quite a romance. Nicholas Rostov! She was surrounded, and they
1|wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in
1|and saved her...."
1|
1|"Another romance," said the militia officer. "Really, this general
1|flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche
1|is one and Princess Bolkonskaya another."
1|
1|"Do you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du
1|jeune homme."*
1|
1|
1|*"A little bit in love with the young man."
1|
1|
1|"Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!"
1|
1|"But how could one say that in Russian?"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchin's
1|broadsheets that had been brought that day.
1|
1|The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchin had
1|forbidden people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was
1|glad that ladies and tradesmen's wives were leaving the city. "There
1|will be less panic and less gossip," ran the broadsheet "but I will
1|stake my life on it that scoundrel will not enter Moscow." These words
1|showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would enter
1|Moscow. The second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at
1|Vyazma, that Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as
1|many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were
1|ready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which
1|could be had at a low price. The tone of the proclamation was not as
1|jocose as in the former Chigirin talks. Pierre pondered over these
1|broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the
1|whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in
1|him was drawing near.
1|
1|"Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?" he asked
1|himself for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on
1|the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience.
1|
1|"If this patience comes out," he said to himself after shuffling the
1|cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, "if it comes
1|out, it means... what does it mean?"
1|
1|He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of
1|the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.
1|
1|"Then it will mean that I must go to the army," said Pierre to
1|himself. "Come in, come in!" he added to the princess.
1|
1|Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long
1|waist, was still living in Pierre's house. The two younger ones had
1|both married.
1|
1|"Excuse my coming to you, cousin," she said in a reproachful and
1|agitated voice. "You know some decision must be come to. What is going
1|to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is
1|it that we are staying on?"
1|
1|"On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine," said Pierre
1|in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling
1|uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.
1|
1|"Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivanovna told me
1|today how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly
1|does them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous--they no
1|longer obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they
1|will soon begin beating us. One can't walk in the streets. But,
1|above all, the French will be here any day now, so what are we waiting
1|for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin," she went on, "arrange for
1|me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can't live under
1|Bonaparte's rule."
1|
1|"Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On
1|the contrary..."
1|
1|"I won't submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If
1|you don't want to do this..."
1|
1|"But I will, I'll give the order at once."
1|
1|The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry
1|with. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.
1|
1|"But you have been misinformed," said Pierre. "Everything is quiet
1|in the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I've just been
1|reading..." He showed her the broadsheet. "Count Rostopchin writes
1|that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter
1|Moscow."
1|
1|"Oh, that count of yours!" said the princess malevolently. "He is
1|a hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot.
1|Didn't he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, 'whoever
1|it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'? (How
1|silly!) 'And honor and glory to whoever captures him,' he says. This
1|is what his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Ivanovna told me the
1|mob near killed her because she said something in French."
1|
1|"Oh, but it's so... You take everything so to heart," said Pierre,
1|and began laying out his cards for patience.
1|
1|Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,
1|but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,
1|irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting
1|something terrible.
1|
1|Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre's head
1|steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment
1|of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates.
1|In general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of
1|raising a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely
1|able to repress a smile.
1|
1|"Well then, sell it," said he. "What's to be done? I can't draw back
1|now!"
1|
1|The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the
1|better was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the
1|catastrophe he expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was
1|left in town. Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his
1|intimate friends only the Rostovs remained, but he did not go to see
1|them.
1|
1|To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of
1|Vorontsovo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to
1|destroy the foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The
1|balloon was not yet ready, but Pierre learned that it was being
1|constructed by the Emperor's desire. The Emperor had written to
1|Count Rostopchin as follows:
1|
1|
1|As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and
1|intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutuzov to
1|let him know. I have informed him of the matter.
1|
1|Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for
1|the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the
1|enemy's hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with
1|those of the commander in chief.
1|
1|
1|On his way home from Vorontsovo, as he was passing the Bolotnoe
1|Place Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lobnoe Place, stopped and
1|got out of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being
1|flogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was
1|releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in
1|blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously.
1|Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their faces
1|they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering look
1|resembling that on the thin Frenchman's face, Pierre pushed his way in
1|through the crowd.
1|
1|"What is it? Who is it? What is it for?" he kept asking.
1|
1|But the attention of the crowd--officials, burghers, shopkeepers,
1|peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses--was so eagerly centered
1|on what was passing in Lobnoe Place that no one answered him. The
1|stout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently
1|trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking
1|about him, but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in
1|the way full-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for
1|doing so. In the crowd people began talking loudly, to stifle their
1|feelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.
1|
1|"He's cook to some prince."
1|
1|"Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets
1|his teeth on edge!" said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind
1|Pierre, when the Frenchman began to cry.
1|
1|The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be
1|appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch
1|in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.
1|
1|Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went
1|back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took
1|his seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times
1|so audibly that the coachman asked him:
1|
1|"What is your pleasure?"
1|
1|"Where are you going?" shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to
1|Lubyanka Street.
1|
1|"To the Governor's, as you ordered," answered the coachman.
1|
1|"Fool! Idiot!" shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman--a thing he
1|rarely did. "Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!" "I must
1|get away this very day," he murmured to himself.
1|
1|At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
1|Lobnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he
1|could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that
1|very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman
1|this or that the man ought to have known it for himself.
1|
1|On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey--his head coachman who
1|knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow--that
1|he would leave that night for the army at Mozhaysk, and that his
1|saddle horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged
1|that day, so on Evstafey's representation Pierre had to put off his
1|departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent
1|on in advance.
1|
1|On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain,
1|and after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night
1|in Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that
1|evening. (This was the battle of Shevardino.) He was told that there
1|in Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could
1|answer his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was
1|approaching Mozhaysk.
1|
1|Every house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the
1|hostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no
1|room to be had. It was full of officers.
1|
1|Everywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on
1|the march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and
1|cannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and
1|the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into
1|that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation
1|and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a
1|feeling akin to what he had felt at the Sloboda Palace during the
1|Emperor's visit--a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and
1|sacrificing something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that
1|everything that constitutes men's happiness--the comforts of life,
1|wealth, even life itself--is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away,
1|compared with something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did
1|not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular
1|delight in sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the
1|question of what to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself
1|afforded him a new and joyous sensation.
1|

1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevardino
1|Redoubt was fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either
1|side, and on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodino itself took
1|place.
1|
1|Why and how were the battles of Shevardino and Borodino given and
1|accepted? Why was the battle of Borodino fought? There was not the
1|least sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate
1|result for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought
1|nearer to the destruction of Moscow--which we feared more than
1|anything in the world; and for the French its immediate result was
1|that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole
1|army--which they feared more than anything in the world. What the
1|result must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kutuzov
1|accepted that battle.
1|
1|If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it
1|must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen
1|hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter
1|of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have
1|been equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the
1|loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For
1|Kutuzov this was mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing
1|draughts I have one man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly
1|lose, and therefore should not exchange. When my opponent has
1|sixteen men and I have fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than
1|he, but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times
1|as strong as I am.
1|
1|Before the battle of Borodino our strength in proportion to the
1|French was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little
1|more than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a
1|hundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty
1|thousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced
1|Kutuzov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a
1|commander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of his army and
1|lengthening his lines of communication still more. If it is said
1|that he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow as he had
1|ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much
1|evidence to the contrary. Napoleon's historians themselves tell us
1|that from Smolensk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his
1|extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be
1|the end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smolensk the state in
1|which Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single
1|reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.
1|
1|In giving and accepting battle at Borodino, Kutuzov acted
1|involuntarily and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had
1|occurred, the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the
1|foresight and genius of the generals who, of all the blind tools of
1|history were the most enslaved and involuntary.
1|
1|The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes
1|furnish the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to
1|accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that
1|kind are meaningless.
1|
1|On the other question, how the battle of Borodino and the
1|preceding battle of Shevardino were fought, there also exists a
1|definite and well-known, but quite false, conception. All the
1|historians describe the affair as follows:
1|
1|The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolensk sought
1|out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found
1|such a position at Borodino.
1|
1|The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the
1|left of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolensk) and almost at a right
1|angle to it, from Borodino to Utitsa, at the very place where the
1|battle was fought.
1|
1|In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set
1|up on the Shevardino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth,
1|we are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on
1|the twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in
1|position on the field of Borodino.
1|
1|So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares
1|to look into the matter can easily convince himself.
1|
1|The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the
1|contrary, during the retreat passed many positions better than
1|Borodino. They did not stop at any one of these positions because
1|Kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen,
1|because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself
1|strongly enough, and because Miloradovich had not yet arrived with the
1|militia, and for many other reasons. The fact is that other
1|positions they had passed were stronger, and that the position at
1|Borodino (the one where the battle was fought), far from being strong,
1|was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the
1|Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.
1|
1|Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of
1|Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that
1|is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the
1|twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be
1|fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no
1|entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the
1|twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the
1|position of the Shevardino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless
1|in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it
1|more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all
1|efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till
1|late at night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have
1|sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position
1|on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the
1|Shevardino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we
1|have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and
1|Bagration were convinced that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left
1|flank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself in his report, written
1|in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevardino Redoubt as the
1|left flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on the
1|battle of Borodino were written at leisure, that the incorrect and
1|extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes
1|of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible)
1|that the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post--whereas in reality
1|it was simply a fortified point on the left flank--and that the battle
1|of Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously
1|selected, where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which
1|was almost unentrenched.
1|
1|The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river
1|Kolocha--which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an
1|acute angle--so that the left flank was at Shevardino, the right flank
1|near the village of Novoe, and the center at Borodino at the
1|confluence of the rivers Kolocha and Voyna.
1|
1|To anyone who looks at the field of Borodino without thinking of how
1|the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the
1|river Kolocha, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was
1|to prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolensk road to Moscow.
1|
1|Napoleon, riding to Valuevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as
1|the history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utitsa
1|to Borodino (he could not have seen that position because it did not
1|exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while
1|pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
1|Russian position--at the Shevardino Redoubt--and unexpectedly for
1|the Russians moved his army across the Kolocha. And the Russians,
1|not having time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left
1|wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new
1|position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By
1|crossing to the other side of the Kolocha to the left of the highroad,
1|Napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left
1|(looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the plain
1|between Utitsa, Semenovsk, and Borodino--a plain no more
1|advantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia--and there
1|the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place.
1|
1|Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the
1|Kolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the
1|redoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have
1|doubted that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of our
1|position, and the battle would have taken place where we expected it.
1|In that case we should probably have defended the Shevardino
1|Redoubt--our left flank--still more obstinately. We should have
1|attacked Napoleon in the center or on the right, and the engagement
1|would have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in the position we
1|intended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank took
1|place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard (that is,
1|immediately after the fight at Gridneva), and as the Russian
1|commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general
1|engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and
1|chief action of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the
1|twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
1|twenty-sixth.
1|
1|After the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found ourselves on
1|the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank,
1|and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it
1|chanced to be.
1|
1|Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by
1|weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that
1|position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders--not
1|having fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of our
1|position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of
1|the forthcoming battle from right to left--maintained their extended
1|position from the village of Novoe to Utitsa, and consequently had
1|to move their forces from right to left during the battle. So it
1|happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the
1|entire French army launched against our left flank with but half as
1|many men. (Poniatowski's action against Utitsa, and Uvarov's on the
1|right flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main
1|course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodino did not take place at
1|all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders' mistakes even at the
1|cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it
1|has been described. The battle of Borodino was not fought on a
1|chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than
1|those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shevardino
1|Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodino on an open and
1|almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the
1|French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely
1|unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result,
1|but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration
1|and flight.
1|

1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozhaysk. At
1|the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led
1|out of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was
1|being held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle
1|and proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down
1|the hill preceded by its singers. Coming up toward him was a train
1|of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day
1|before. The peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept
1|crossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which three or
1|four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted over the stones
1|that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like
1|a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks,
1|compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the
1|carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost all of them
1|stared with naive, childlike curiosity at Pierre's white hat and green
1|swallow-tail coat.
1|
1|Pierre's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep
1|to one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the
1|hill with its singers, surrounded Pierre's carriage and blocked the
1|road. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in
1|which the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not
1|penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above
1|Pierre's head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded
1|merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road
1|close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it,
1|placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began
1|arranging the breech-band on his little horse.
1|
1|One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was
1|following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand
1|and turned to look at Pierre.
1|
1|"I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us
1|on to Moscow?" he asked.
1|
1|Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question.
1|He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy
1|of wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two
1|wounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in
1|the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was
1|wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby's
1|head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was
1|looking at the cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a
1|fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his
1|thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third
1|lay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry singers were
1|passing close by:
1|
1|   Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,
1|   Living in a foreign land.
1|
1|they sang their soldiers' dance song.
1|
1|As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the
1|metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays
1|of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another
1|sort of merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded
1|near the panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber,
1|and sad.
1|
1|The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
1|singers.
1|
1|"Oh, the coxcombs!" he muttered reproachfully.
1|
1|"It's not the soldiers only, but I've seen peasants today, too....
1|The peasants--even they have to go," said the soldier behind the cart,
1|addressing Pierre with a sad smile. "No distinctions made nowadays....
1|They want the whole nation to fall on them--in a word, it's Moscow!
1|They want to make an end of it."
1|
1|In spite of the obscurity of the soldier's words Pierre understood
1|what he wanted to say and nodded approval.
1|
1|The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.
1|
1|He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but
1|only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of
1|different branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at
1|his white hat and green tail coat.
1|
1|Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
1|eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was
1|driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young
1|surgeon, and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied
1|the driver's seat to pull up.
1|
1|"Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?" asked the doctor.
1|
1|"Well, you know, I wanted to see..."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, there will be something to see...."
1|
1|Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of
1|taking part in a battle.
1|
1|The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov.
1|
1|"Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?"
1|he said, exchanging glances with his young companion. "Anyhow his
1|Serene Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That's what
1|you must do."
1|
1|The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.
1|
1|"You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is
1|exactly?" said Pierre.
1|
1|"The position?" repeated the doctor. "Well, that's not my line.
1|Drive past Tatarinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the
1|hillock and you'll see."
1|
1|"Can one see from there?... If you would..."
1|
1|But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.
1|
1|"I would go with you but on my honor I'm up to here"--and he pointed
1|to his throat. "I'm galloping to the commander of the corps. How do
1|matters stand?... You know, Count, there'll be a battle tomorrow.
1|Out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty
1|thousand wounded, and we haven't stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or
1|doctors enough for six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we
1|need other things as well--we must manage as best we can!"
1|
1|The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who
1|had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had
1|noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
1|amazed Pierre.
1|
1|"They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but
1|death?" And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the
1|Mozhaysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the
1|slanting rays of the sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly
1|recurred to his mind.
1|
1|"The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a
1|moment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded.
1|Yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they
1|wonder at my hat! Strange!" thought Pierre, continuing his way to
1|Tatarinova.
1|
1|In front of a landowner's house to the left of the road stood
1|carriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The
1|commander in chief was putting up there, but just when Pierre
1|arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there--they had
1|gone to the church service. Pierre drove on toward Gorki.
1|
1|When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street,
1|he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and
1|with crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated
1|and perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to
1|the right of the road.
1|
1|Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
1|along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.
1|
1|Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On
1|seeing these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the
1|novelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the
1|wounded men at Mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when
1|he said: "They want the whole nation to fall on them." The sight of
1|these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer,
1|clumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the
1|left toward the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned
1|collarbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and
1|importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling
1|militiamen, ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor,
1|the battlefield could be seen.
1|
1|It was about eleven o'clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left
1|and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising
1|like an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied
1|atmosphere.
1|
1|From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the
1|Smolensk highroad, passing through a village with a white church
1|some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was
1|Borodino. Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge
1|and, winding down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of
1|Valuevo visible about four miles away, where Napoleon was then
1|stationed. Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest
1|on the horizon. Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to
1|the right of the road, the cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery
1|gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue
1|expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking
1|campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops--ours and
1|the enemy's. The ground to the right--along the course of the
1|Kolocha and Moskva rivers--was broken and hilly. Between the hollows
1|the villages of Bezubova and Zakharino showed in the distance. On
1|the left the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and
1|the smoking ruins of Semenovsk, which had been burned down, could be
1|seen.
1|
1|All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor
1|the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations.
1|Nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only
1|fields, meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages,
1|mounds, and streams; and try as he would he could descry no military
1|"position" in this place which teemed with life, nor could he even
1|distinguish our troops from the enemy's.
1|
1|"I must ask someone who knows," he thought, and addressed an officer
1|who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.
1|
1|"May I ask you," said Pierre, "what village that is in front?"
1|
1|"Burdino, isn't it?" said the officer, turning to his companion.
1|
1|"Borodino," the other corrected him.
1|
1|The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up
1|to Pierre.
1|
1|"Are those our men there?" Pierre inquired.
1|
1|"Yes, and there, further on, are the French," said the officer.
1|"There they are, there... you can see them."
1|
1|"Where? Where?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!"
1|
1|The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left
1|beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that
1|Pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.
1|
1|"Ah, those are the French! And over there?..." Pierre pointed to a
1|knoll on the left, near which some troops could be seen.
1|
1|"Those are ours."
1|
1|"Ah, ours! And there?..." Pierre pointed to another knoll in the
1|distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow
1|where also some campfires were smoking and something black was
1|visible.
1|
1|"That's his again," said the officer. (It was the Shevardino
1|Redoubt.) "It was ours yesterday, but now it is his."
1|
1|"Then how about our position?"
1|
1|"Our position?" replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. "I
1|can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our
1|entrenchments. There, you see? There's our center, at Borodino, just
1|there," and he pointed to the village in front of them with the
1|white church. "That's where one crosses the Kolocha. You see down
1|there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there's the
1|bridge. That's our center. Our right flank is over there"--he
1|pointed sharply to the right, far away in the broken ground--"That's
1|where the Moskva River is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there,
1|very strong ones. The left flank..." here the officer paused. "Well,
1|you see, that's difficult to explain.... Yesterday our left flank
1|was there at Shevardino, you see, where the oak is, but now we have
1|withdrawn our left wing--now it is over there, do you see that village
1|and the smoke? That's Semenovsk, yes, there," he pointed to
1|Raevski's knoll. "But the battle will hardly be there. His having
1|moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will probably pass round
1|to the right of the Moskva. But wherever it may be, many a man will be
1|missing tomorrow!" he remarked.
1|
1|An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was
1|giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish
1|speaking, but at this point, evidently not liking the officer's
1|remark, interrupted him.
1|
1|"Gabions must be sent for," said he sternly.
1|
1|The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might
1|think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
1|of it.
1|
1|"Well, send number three company again," the officer replied
1|hurriedly.
1|
1|"And you, are you one of the doctors?"
1|
1|"No, I've come on my own," answered Pierre, and he went down the
1|hill again, passing the militiamen.
1|
1|"Oh, those damned fellows!" muttered the officer who followed him,
1|holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.
1|
1|"There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They'll
1|be here in a minute..." voices were suddenly heard saying; and
1|officers, soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the
1|road.
1|
1|A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodino. First
1|along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with
1|arms reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.
1|
1|Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the
1|procession.
1|
1|"They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of
1|God!" someone cried.
1|
1|"The Smolensk Mother of God," another corrected him.
1|
1|The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who
1|had been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to
1|meet the church procession. Following the battalion that marched along
1|the dusty road came priests in their vestments--one little old man in
1|a hood with attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers
1|bore a large, dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was
1|the icon that had been brought from Smolensk and had since accompanied
1|the army. Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with
1|bared heads walked, ran, and bowed to the ground.
1|
1|At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had
1|been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
1|others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot
1|rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
1|the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.
1|The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of
1|bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.
1|Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot
1|reserved for them. A bald general with a St. George's Cross on his
1|neck stood just behind the priest's back, and without crossing himself
1|(he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service,
1|which he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to
1|arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in
1|a martial pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his
1|chest while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants,
1|Pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did
1|not look at them--his whole attention was absorbed in watching the
1|serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and
1|militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the
1|tired chanters, who were singing the service for the twentieth time
1|that day, began lazily and mechanically to sing: "Save from calamity
1|Thy servants, O Mother of God," and the priest and deacon chimed in:
1|"For to Thee under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and
1|protection," there again kindled in all those faces the same
1|expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment
1|that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozhaysk
1|and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and
1|heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and
1|the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.
1|
1|The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.
1|Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which
1|way was made for him, was approaching the icon.
1|
1|It was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the position and on his
1|way back to Tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held.
1|Pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which
1|distinguished him from everybody else.
1|
1|With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,
1|with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
1|eye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the
1|crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an
1|accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand,
1|and bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutuzov was
1|Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in
1|chief, who attracted the attention of all the superior officers, the
1|militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at
1|him.
1|
1|When the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, sank
1|heavily to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried
1|vainly to rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and
1|weight. His white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose,
1|kissed the icon as a child does with naively pouting lips, and again
1|bowed till he touched the ground with his hand. The other generals
1|followed his example, then the officers, and after them with excited
1|faces, pressing on one another, crowding, panting, and pushing,
1|scrambled the soldiers and militiamen.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.
1|
1|"Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?" said a voice.
1|
1|Pierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees with his
1|hand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the
1|icon), came up to him smiling. Boris was elegantly dressed, with a
1|slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long
1|coat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.
1|
1|Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in
1|the shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run
1|to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and
1|brilliant suite surrounded him.
1|
1|The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre
1|stopped some thirty paces from Kutuzov, talking to Boris.
1|
1|He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
1|position.
1|
1|"This is what you must do," said Boris. "I will do the honors of the
1|camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen
1|will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I'll mention it to
1|him. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us.
1|We are just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend
1|the night with me and we'll arrange a game of cards. Of course you
1|know Dmitri Sergeevich? Those are his quarters," and he pointed to the
1|third house in the village of Gorki.
1|
1|"But I should like to see the right flank. They say it's very
1|strong," said Pierre. "I should like to start from the Moskva River
1|and ride round the whole position."
1|
1|"Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left
1|flank."
1|
1|"Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski's regiment? Can you point
1|it out to me?"
1|
1|"Prince Andrew's? We shall pass it and I'll take you to him."
1|
1|"What about the left flank?" asked Pierre
1|
1|"To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state
1|our left flank is in," said Boris confidentially lowering his voice.
1|"It is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify
1|that knoll quite differently, but..." Boris shrugged his shoulders,
1|"his Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him.
1|You see..." but Boris did not finish, for at that moment Kaysarov,
1|Kutuzov's adjutant, came up to Pierre. "Ah, Kaysarov!" said Boris,
1|addressing him with an unembarrassed smile, "I was just trying to
1|explain our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene
1|Highness could so foresee the intentions of the French!"
1|
1|"You mean the left flank?" asked Kaysarov.
1|
1|"Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong."
1|
1|Though Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff,
1|Boris had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He
1|had established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom
1|Boris had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskoy an
1|invaluable man.
1|
1|In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties:
1|Kutuzov's party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris
1|belonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile
1|respect to Kutuzov, could so create an impression that the old
1|fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now
1|the decisive moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be destroyed
1|and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kutuzov won the battle
1|it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case
1|many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow's action, and
1|new men would come to the front. So Boris was full of nervous vivacity
1|all day.
1|
1|After Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had
1|not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered
1|upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all
1|expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the
1|cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in
1|questions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by
1|the different expression he saw on other faces--an expression that
1|spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life
1|and death. Kutuzov noticed Pierre's figure and the group gathered
1|round him.
1|
1|"Call him to me," said Kutuzov.
1|
1|An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness' wish, and Pierre
1|went toward Kutuzov's bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It
1|was Dolokhov.
1|
1|"How did that fellow get here?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!" was the answer. "He has
1|been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He's been
1|proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy's picket
1|line at night.... He's a brave fellow."
1|
1|Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov.
1|
1|"I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might
1|send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I
1|shouldn't lose anything..." Dolokhov was saying.
1|
1|"Yes, yes."
1|
1|"But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my
1|Fatherland for which I am ready to die."
1|
1|"Yes, yes."
1|
1|"And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare
1|his skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your
1|Serene Highness."
1|
1|"Yes... Yes..." Kutuzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more
1|and more as he looked at Pierre.
1|
1|Just then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to
1|Pierre's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner, without
1|raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted
1|conversation:
1|
1|"The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What
1|heroism, Count!"
1|
1|Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by
1|his Serene Highness. He knew Kutuzov's attention would be caught by
1|those words, and so it was.
1|
1|"What are you saying about the militia?" he asked Boris.
1|
1|"Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness--for death--they
1|have put on clean shirts."
1|
1|"Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!" said Kutuzov; and he closed
1|his eyes and swayed his head. "A matchless people!" he repeated with a
1|sigh.
1|
1|"So you want to smell gunpowder?" he said to Pierre. "Yes, it's a
1|pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife's adorers.
1|Is she well? My quarters are at your service."
1|
1|And as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began looking about
1|absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.
1|
1|Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew
1|Kaysarov, his adjutant's brother.
1|
1|"Those verses... those verses of Marin's... how do they go, eh?
1|Those he wrote about Gerakov: 'Lectures for the corps inditing'...
1|Recite them, recite them!" said he, evidently preparing to laugh.
1|
1|Kaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm
1|of the verses.
1|
1|When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and took his
1|hand.
1|
1|"I am very glad to meet you here, Count," he said aloud,
1|regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute
1|and solemn tone. "On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us
1|is fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that
1|I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should
1|wish you not to have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me."
1|
1|Pierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to
1|him. With tears in his eyes Dolokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.
1|
1|Boris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to
1|Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
1|
1|"It will interest you," said he.
1|
1|"Yes, very much," replied Pierre.
1|
1|Half an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova, and Bennigsen and
1|his suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the
1|line.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIII
1|
1|
1|From Gorki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which,
1|when they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out
1|as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant
1|new-mown hay lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into
1|the village of Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an
1|enormous number of troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where
1|militiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which
1|afterwards became known as the Raevski Redoubt, or the Knoll
1|Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it. He did not know
1|that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on
1|the plain of Borodino.
1|
1|They then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, where the soldiers were
1|dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode
1|downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if
1|by hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the
1|furrows of the plowed land, and reached some fleches* which were still
1|being dug.
1|
1|
1|*A kind of entrenchment.
1|
1|
1|At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevardino
1|Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several
1|horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon
1|or Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
1|horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the
1|scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men
1|rode away from the mound and disappeared.
1|
1|Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began
1|explaining the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him,
1|straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the
1|impending battle, but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity
1|was inadequate for the task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen
1|stopped speaking and, noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly
1|said to him:
1|
1|"I don't think this interests you?"
1|
1|"On the contrary it's very interesting!" replied Pierre not quite
1|truthfully.
1|
1|From the fleches they rode still farther to the left, along a road
1|winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of
1|the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the
1|tramp of the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the
1|road in front of them for some time, arousing general attention and
1|laughter, and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to
1|one side and disappear in the thicket. After going through the wood
1|for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of
1|Tuchkov's corps were stationed to defend the left flank.
1|
1|Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and
1|with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great
1|military importance. In front of Tuchkov's troops was some high ground
1|not occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake,
1|saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the
1|country around unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the
1|generals expressed the same opinion. One in particular declared with
1|martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen
1|on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground.
1|This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre's doubt of his own
1|capacity to understand military matters. Listening to Bennigsen and
1|the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill,
1|he quite understood them and shared their opinion, but for that very
1|reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind
1|the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.
1|
1|Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen
1|supposed, put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed
1|position as an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be
1|able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not
1|know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas
1|without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIV
1|
1|
1|On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on
1|his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkovo at the
1|further end of his regiment's encampment. Through a gap in the
1|broken wall he could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty
1|year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off, a field on
1|which shocks of oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose
1|the smoke of campfires--the soldiers' kitchens.
1|
1|Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed
1|to him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable
1|as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.
1|
1|He had received and given the orders for next day's battle and had
1|nothing more to do. But his thoughts--the simplest, clearest, and
1|therefore most terrible thoughts--would give him no peace. He knew
1|that tomorrow's battle would be the most terrible of all he had
1|taken part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of
1|death presented itself to him--not in relation to any worldly matter
1|or with reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to
1|himself, to his own soul--vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as
1|a certainty. And from the height of this perception all that had
1|previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined
1|by a cold white light without shadows, without perspective, without
1|distinction of outline. All life appeared to him like magic-lantern
1|pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light
1|through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in
1|clear daylight and without a glass. "Yes, yes! There they are, those
1|false images that agitated, enraptured, and tormented me," said he
1|to himself, passing in review the principal pictures of the magic
1|lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of
1|his clear perception of death. "There they are, those rudely painted
1|figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of
1|society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself--how important these
1|pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to
1|be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold
1|white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me." The three
1|great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his love
1|for a woman, his father's death, and the French invasion which had
1|overrun half Russia. "Love... that little girl who seemed to me
1|brimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made
1|romantic plans of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I
1|was!" he said aloud bitterly. "Ah me! I believed in some ideal love
1|which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence!
1|Like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me....
1|But it was much simpler really.... It was all very simple and
1|horrible."
1|
1|"When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his
1|land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,
1|unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his
1|path, and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess
1|Mary says it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when
1|he is not here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is
1|the trial intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And
1|tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one
1|of our own men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as
1|one of them did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by
1|head and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under
1|their noses, and new conditions of life will arise, which will seem
1|quite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall
1|not exist..."
1|
1|He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with
1|their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. "To die...
1|to be killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this
1|should still be, but no me...."
1|
1|And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the
1|smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed
1|terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose
1|quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.
1|
1|After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. "Who's
1|that?" he cried.
1|
1|The red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly Dolokhov's squadron
1|commander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander,
1|shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental
1|paymaster.
1|
1|Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come
1|about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss
1|them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.
1|
1|"Devil take it!" said the voice of a man stumbling over something.
1|
1|Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped
1|over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It
1|was unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in
1|general, and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful
1|moments of his last visit to Moscow.
1|
1|"You? What a surprise!" said he. "What brings you here? This is
1|unexpected!"
1|
1|As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness--they
1|expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached
1|the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew's face he felt
1|constrained and ill at ease.
1|
1|"I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me," said
1|Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
1|"interesting." "I wish to see the battle."
1|
1|"Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would
1|they stop it?" said Prince Andrew sarcastically. "Well, and how's
1|Moscow? And my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?" he asked
1|seriously.
1|
1|"Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me so. I went to see them,
1|but missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXV
1|
1|
1|The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently
1|reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and
1|have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed
1|with surprise at Pierre's huge stout figure and listened to his talk
1|of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden.
1|Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding
1|that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured
1|battalion commander.
1|
1|"So you understand the whole position of our troops?" Prince
1|Andrew interrupted him.
1|
1|"Yes--that is, how do you mean?" said Pierre. "Not being a
1|military man I can't say I have understood it fully, but I
1|understand the general position."
1|
1|"Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may," said
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Oh!" said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince
1|Andrew. "Well, and what do you think of Kutuzov's appointment?" he
1|asked.
1|
1|"I was very glad of his appointment, that's all I know," replied
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are
1|saying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?"
1|
1|"Ask them," replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.
1|
1|Pierre looked at Timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative
1|smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.
1|
1|"We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your
1|excellency," said Timokhin timidly, and continually turning to
1|glance at his colonel.
1|
1|"Why so?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you.
1|Why, when we were retreating from Sventsyani we dare not touch a stick
1|or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would
1|get it all; wasn't it so, your excellency?" and again Timokhin
1|turned to the prince. "But we daren't. In our regiment two officers
1|were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity
1|took command everything became straight forward. Now we see light..."
1|
1|"Then why was it forbidden?"
1|
1|Timokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to
1|answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
1|enemy," said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. "It is very sound: one
1|can't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
1|marauding. At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might
1|outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand
1|this," cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
1|involuntarily: "he could not understand that there, for the first
1|time, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit
1|in the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the
1|French for two days, and that that success had increased our
1|strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and
1|losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried
1|to do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he
1|is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out
1|everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to.
1|How can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, and he
1|is a splendid valet and satisfies your father's requirements better
1|than you could, then it's all right to let him serve. But if your
1|father is mortally sick you'll send the valet away and attend to
1|your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will
1|soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it
1|has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could
1|serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in
1|danger she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been
1|making him out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the
1|only result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their false
1|accusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a
1|traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and
1|very punctilious German."
1|
1|"And they say he's a skillful commander," rejoined Pierre.
1|
1|"I don't understand what is meant by 'a skillful commander,'"
1|replied Prince Andrew ironically.
1|
1|"A skillful commander?" replied Pierre. "Why, one who foresees all
1|contingencies... and foresees the adversary's intentions."
1|
1|"But that's impossible," said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter
1|settled long ago.
1|
1|Pierre looked at him in surprise.
1|
1|"And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?" he remarked.
1|
1|"Yes," replied Prince Andrew, "but with this little difference, that
1|in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are
1|not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is
1|always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than
1|one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division
1|and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies
1|of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me," he went on, "if
1|things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there
1|making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve
1|here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us
1|tomorrow's battle will depend and not on those others.... Success
1|never depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or
1|even on numbers, and least of all on position."
1|
1|"But on what then?"
1|
1|"On the feeling that is in me and in him," he pointed to Timokhin,
1|"and in each soldier."
1|
1|Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his commander in
1|alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity
1|Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from
1|expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.
1|
1|"A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we
1|lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal
1|to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the
1|battle, and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to
1|fight for there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as
1|we could. 'We've lost, so let us run,' and we ran. If we had not
1|said that till the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened.
1|But tomorrow we shan't say it! You talk about our position, the left
1|flank weak and the right flank too extended," he went on. "That's
1|all nonsense, there's nothing of the kind. But what awaits us
1|tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided
1|on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run,
1|and that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at
1|present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you have
1|ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder.
1|They are only concerned with their own petty interests."
1|
1|"At such a moment?" said Pierre reproachfully.
1|
1|"At such a moment!" Prince Andrew repeated. "To them it is only a
1|moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an
1|extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a
1|hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to
1|fight, and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight
1|and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will
1|win. And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and
1|whatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow's
1|battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!"
1|
1|"There now, your excellency! That's the truth, the real truth," said
1|Timokhin. "Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my
1|battalion, believe me, wouldn't drink their vodka! 'It's not the day
1|for that!' they say."
1|
1|All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the
1|shed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had
1|gone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a
1|conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses' hoofs on the
1|road not far from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince
1|Andrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack.
1|They rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew
1|involuntarily heard these words:
1|
1|"Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht
1|genug Preis geben,"* said one of them.
1|
1|
1|*"The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently commend
1|that view."
1|
1|
1|"Oh, ja," said the other, "der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwachen,
1|so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung
1|nehmen."*
1|
1|
1|*"Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of course one
1|cannot take into account the loss of private individuals."
1|
1|
1|"Oh, no," agreed the other.
1|
1|"Extend widely!" said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they
1|had ridden past. "In that 'extend' were my father, son, and sister, at
1|Bald Hills. That's all the same to him! That's what I was saying to
1|you--those German gentlemen won't win the battle tomorrow but will
1|only make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their
1|German heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven't in
1|their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow--that which Timokhin has.
1|They have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us.
1|Fine teachers!" and again his voice grew shrill.
1|
1|"So you think we shall win tomorrow's battle?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Yes, yes," answered Prince Andrew absently. "One thing I would do
1|if I had the power," he began again, "I would not take prisoners.
1|Why take prisoners? It's chivalry! The French have destroyed my home
1|and are on their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are
1|outraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are
1|all criminals. And so thinks Timokhin and the whole army. They
1|should be executed! Since they are my foes they cannot be my
1|friends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit."
1|
1|"Yes, yes," muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince
1|Andrew. "I quite agree with you!"
1|
1|The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill and
1|all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He
1|now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
1|impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and
1|stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for
1|him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in
1|physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,
1|and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly,
1|and as it were lightheartedly.
1|
1|"Not take prisoners," Prince Andrew continued: "That by itself would
1|quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have
1|played at war--that's what's vile! We play at magnanimity and all that
1|stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
1|sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed:
1|she is so kindhearted that she can't look at blood, but enjoys eating
1|the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of
1|chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on.
1|It's all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they
1|humbugged us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people's
1|houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my
1|children and my father, and then talk of rules of war and
1|magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who
1|has come to this as I have through the same sufferings..."
1|
1|Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or
1|not Moscow was taken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly checked in his
1|speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a
1|few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips
1|quivered as he began speaking.
1|
1|"If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war
1|only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then
1|there would not be war because Paul Ivanovich had offended Michael
1|Ivanovich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war!
1|And then the determination of the troops would be quite different.
1|Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading
1|would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in
1|Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the
1|most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not
1|play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and
1|seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be
1|war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the
1|idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.
1|
1|"But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are
1|the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of
1|war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a
1|country's inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army,
1|and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the
1|military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline,
1|idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in
1|spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.
1|All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he
1|who kills most people receives the highest rewards.
1|
1|"They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they
1|kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services
1|for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number),
1|and they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they
1|have killed the greater their achievement. How does God above look
1|at them and hear them?" exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill,
1|piercing voice. "Ah, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to
1|live. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn't
1|do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil....
1|Ah, well, it's not for long!" he added.
1|
1|"However, you're sleepy, and it's time for me to sleep. Go back to
1|Gorki!" said Prince Andrew suddenly.
1|
1|"Oh no!" Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,
1|compassionate eyes.
1|
1|"Go, go! Before a battle one must have one's sleep out," repeated
1|Prince Andrew.
1|
1|He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him.
1|"Good-by, be off!" he shouted. "Whether we meet again or not..."
1|and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.
1|
1|It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the
1|expression of Prince Andrew's face was angry or tender.
1|
1|For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should
1|follow him or go away. "No, he does not want it!" Pierre concluded.
1|"And I know that this is our last meeting!" He sighed deeply and
1|rode back to Gorki.
1|
1|On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he
1|could not sleep.
1|
1|He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his
1|imagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly
1|recalled an evening in Petersburg. Natasha with animated and excited
1|face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the
1|previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She
1|incoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a
1|talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to
1|say: "No, I can't! I'm not telling it right; no, you don't
1|understand," though he encouraged her by saying that he did
1|understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say. But
1|Natasha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did
1|not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that
1|day and wished to convey. "He was such a delightful old man, and it
1|was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can't
1|describe it," she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew
1|smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her
1|eyes. "I understood her," he thought. "I not only understood her,
1|but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that
1|frankness of soul--that very soul of hers which seemed to be
1|fettered by her body--it was that soul I loved in her... loved so
1|strongly and happily..." and suddenly he remembered how his love had
1|ended. "He did not need anything of that kind. He neither saw nor
1|understood anything of the sort. He only saw in her a pretty and fresh
1|young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?...
1|and he is still alive and gay!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again
1|began pacing up and down in front of the shed.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVI
1|
1|
1|On August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodino, M. de Beausset,
1|prefect of the French Emperor's palace, arrived at Napoleon's quarters
1|at Valuevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the
1|latter from Madrid.
1|
1|Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had
1|brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
1|compartment of Napoleon's tent, where he began opening the box while
1|conversing with Napoleon's aides-de-camp who surrounded him.
1|
1|Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking
1|to some generals of his acquaintance.
1|
1|The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was
1|finishing his toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now
1|his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his
1|valet was rubbing him down. Another valet, with his finger over the
1|mouth of a bottle, was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor's
1|pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone
1|knew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon's
1|short hair was wet and matted on the forehead, but his face, though
1|puffy and yellow, expressed physical satisfaction. "Go on, harder,
1|go on!" he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him, slightly
1|twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who had entered the bedroom
1|to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in
1|yesterday's action, was standing by the door after delivering his
1|message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked
1|at him from under his brows.
1|
1|"No prisoners!" said he, repeating the aide-de-camp's words. "They
1|are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the
1|Russian army.... Go on... harder, harder!" he muttered, hunching his
1|back and presenting his fat shoulders.
1|
1|"All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too," he
1|said, nodding to the aide-de-camp.
1|
1|"Yes, sire," and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of
1|the tent.
1|
1|Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform
1|of the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.
1|
1|De Beausset's hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the
1|present he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in
1|front of the entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such
1|unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the
1|surprise.
1|
1|Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that
1|they were not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure
1|of giving him a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and
1|called Fabvier to him, listening silently and with a stern frown to
1|what Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops
1|fighting at Salamanca, at the other end of Europe, with but one
1|thought--to be worthy of their Emperor--and but one fear--to fail to
1|please him. The result of that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon
1|made ironic remarks during Fabvier's account, as if he had not
1|expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.
1|
1|"I must make up for that in Moscow," said Napoleon. "I'll see you
1|later," he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had
1|prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and
1|covered it with a cloth.
1|
1|De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the
1|old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
1|presenting an envelope.
1|
1|Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.
1|
1|"You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?"
1|he asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most
1|cordial tone.
1|
1|"Sire, all Paris regrets your absence," replied de Beausset as was
1|proper.
1|
1|But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of
1|this kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he
1|was pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching
1|his ear.
1|
1|"I am very sorry to have made you travel so far," said he.
1|
1|"Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of
1|Moscow," replied de Beausset.
1|
1|Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the
1|right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
1|gold snuffbox, which he took.
1|
1|"Yes, it has happened luckily for you," he said, raising the open
1|snuffbox to his nose. "You are fond of travel, and in three days you
1|will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic
1|capital. You will have a pleasant journey."
1|
1|De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel
1|(of which he had not till then been aware).
1|
1|"Ha, what's this?" asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers
1|were looking at something concealed under a cloth.
1|
1|With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without
1|turning his back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the
1|cloth at the same time, and said:
1|
1|"A present to Your Majesty from the Empress."
1|
1|It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gerard, of the son
1|borne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy
1|whom for some reason everyone called "The King of Rome."
1|
1|A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the
1|Sistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball
1|represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a
1|scepter.
1|
1|Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by
1|depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick,
1|the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all
1|who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.
1|
1|"The King of Rome!" he said, pointing to the portrait with a
1|graceful gesture. "Admirable!"
1|
1|With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the
1|expression of his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and
1|assumed a look of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said
1|and did would be historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be
1|best for him--whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball
1|with the terrestrial globe--to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the
1|simplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward,
1|glanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and
1|sat down on it before the portrait. At a single gesture from him
1|everyone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and
1|his emotion.
1|
1|Having sat still for a while he touched--himself not knowing why--the
1|thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,
1|rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the
1|portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed
1|round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of
1|Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.
1|
1|And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with
1|him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of
1|the officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the
1|portrait.
1|
1|"Vive l'Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l'Empereur!" came
1|those ecstatic cries.
1|
1|After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset's presence dictated his
1|order of the day to the army.
1|
1|"Short and energetic!" he remarked when he had read over the
1|proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections.
1|It ran:
1|
1|
1|Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends
1|on you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need:
1|comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you
1|did at Austerlitz, Friedland, Vitebsk, and Smolensk. Let our
1|remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride. Let
1|it be said of each of you: "He was in the great battle before Moscow!"
1|
1|
1|"Before Moscow!" repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who
1|was so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of
1|the tent to where the horses stood saddled.
1|
1|"Your Majesty is too kind!" replied de Beausset to the invitation to
1|accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride
1|and was afraid of doing so.
1|
1|But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount.
1|When Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before
1|his son's portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.
1|
1|"Take him away!" he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic
1|gesture to the portrait. "It is too soon for him to see a field of
1|battle."
1|
1|De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to
1|indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor's
1|words.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVII
1|
1|
1|On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon
1|spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality,
1|considering plans submitted to him by his marshals, and personally
1|giving commands to his generals.
1|
1|The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolocha
1|had been dislocated by the capture of the Shevardino Redoubt on the
1|twenty-fourth, and part of the line--the left flank--had been drawn
1|back. That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it
1|the ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to
1|anyone, military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It
1|would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this
1|conclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the
1|Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any need of that special and
1|supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to
1|Napoleon; yet the historians who described the event later and the men
1|who then surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.
1|
1|Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a
1|profound air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head
1|dubiously, and without communicating to the generals around him the
1|profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them
1|his final conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a
1|suggestion from Davout, who was now called Prince d'Eckmuhl, to turn
1|the Russian left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without
1|explaining why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to
1|attack the fleches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon
1|agreed, though the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to
1|remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might
1|disorder the division.
1|
1|Having inspected the country opposite the Shevardino Redoubt,
1|Napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots
1|where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against
1|the Russian entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them,
1|the field artillery should be placed.
1|
1|After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and
1|the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.
1|
1|These dispositions, of which the French historians write with
1|enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect, were as
1|follows:
1|
1|
1|At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the
1|plain occupied by the Prince d'Eckmuhl will open fire on the
1|opposing batteries of the enemy.
1|
1|At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,
1|General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan's division and all
1|the howitzers of Dessaix's and Friant's divisions, will move
1|forward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy's
1|battery, against which will operate:
1|
1|        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards
1|        30 guns of Campan's division
1|
1|and      8 guns of Friant's and Dessaix's divisions
1|        --
1|
1|in all  62 guns.
1|
1|
1|The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouche,
1|will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all,
1|on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on
1|the left, which will have forty guns in all directed against it.
1|
1|General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all
1|the howitzers of the Guard's artillery against either one or other
1|of the entrenchments.
1|
1|During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the
1|wood on the village and turn the enemy's position.
1|
1|General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first
1|fortification.
1|
1|After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given
1|in accordance with the enemy's movements.
1|
1|The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of
1|the right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand's division and
1|of the vice-King's division will open a heavy fire on seeing the
1|attack commence on the right wing.
1|
1|The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three
1|bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand's and Gibrard's
1|divisions, which under his leadership will be directed against the
1|redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.
1|
1|All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
1|methode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.
1|   The Imperial Camp near Mozhaysk,
1|   September, 6, 1812.
1|
1|
1|These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one
1|allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his
1|genius, related to Napoleon's orders to deal with four points--four
1|different orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.
1|
1|In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
1|spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouche; which
1|were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and
1|shower shells on the Russian fleches and redoubts. This could not be
1|done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not
1|carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until
1|the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon's instructions, moved them
1|forward.
1|
1|The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through
1|the wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done
1|and was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village
1|through the wood, met Tuchkov there barring his way, and could not and
1|did not turn the Russian position.
1|
1|The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to
1|seize the first fortification. General Campan's division did not seize
1|the first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from
1|the wood it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was
1|unaware.
1|
1|The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village
1|(Borodino) and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same
1|heights as Morand's and Gdrard's divisions (for whose movements no
1|directions are given), which under his leadership will be directed
1|against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.
1|
1|As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible
1|sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders
1|given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodino to the
1|redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gerard were to advance
1|simultaneously from the front.
1|
1|All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could
1|not be executed. After passing through Borodino the vice-King was
1|driven back to the Kolocha and could get no farther; while the
1|divisions of Morand and Gerard did not take the redoubt but were
1|driven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle
1|by the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by
1|Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition was, or could
1|be, executed. But in the disposition it is said that, after the
1|fight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given in accordance
1|with the enemy's movements, and so it might be supposed that all
1|necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle.
1|But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle
1|Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know
1|the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight
1|could be executed.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVIII
1|
1|
1|Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of
1|Borodino because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a
1|cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been
1|still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face
1|of the world have been changed. To historians who believe that
1|Russia was shaped by the will of one man--Peter the Great--and that
1|France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to
1|Russia at the will of one man--Napoleon--to say that Russia remained a
1|power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August
1|may seem logical and convincing.
1|
1|If it had depended on Napoleon's will to fight or not to fight the
1|battle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement depended
1|on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of
1|his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who
1|omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth
1|would have been the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought
1|such a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction
1|Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he
1|saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX's
1|stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that Russia was
1|formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French Empire
1|was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man,
1|Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but
1|contrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic
1|events another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of
1|human events is predetermined from on high--depends on the coincidence
1|of the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon's
1|influence on the course of these events is purely external and
1|fictitious.
1|
1|Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the
1|Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX's will, though
1|he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that
1|order; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of
1|eighty thousand men at Borodino was not due to Napoleon's will, though
1|he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it
1|was done because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions
1|appear, yet human dignity--which tells me that each of us is, if not
1|more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon--demands the
1|acceptance of that solution of the question, and historic
1|investigation abundantly confirms it.
1|
1|At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.
1|That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who
1|killed people.
1|
1|The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of
1|Borodino not because of Napoleon's orders but by their own volition.
1|The whole army--French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch--hungry,
1|ragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army
1|blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be
1|drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians, they
1|would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because
1|it was inevitable.
1|
1|When they heard Napoleon's proclamation offering them, as
1|compensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about
1|their having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried "Vive
1|l'Empereur!" just as they had cried "Vive l'Empereur!" at the sight of
1|the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy
1|stick, and just as they would have cried "Vive l'Empereur!" at any
1|nonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to
1|do but cry "Vive l'Empereur!" and go to fight, in order to get food
1|and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of
1|Napoleon's commands that they killed their fellow men.
1|
1|And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for
1|none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know
1|what was going on before him. So the way in which these people
1|killed one another was not decided by Napoleon's will but occurred
1|independently of him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands
1|of people who took part in the common action. It only seemed to
1|Napoleon that it all took place by his will. And so the question
1|whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than
1|the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.
1|
1|Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
1|the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former
1|occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
1|previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon's
1|cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.
1|
1|The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even
1|better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories.
1|His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than
1|formerly, but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders
1|only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodino
1|was the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent
1|dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist
1|criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a
1|battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and
1|orders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to
1|demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been
1|won.
1|
1|The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of
1|Austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition,
1|but still they were criticized--criticized for their very
1|perfection, for their excessive minuteness.
1|
1|Napoleon at the battle of Borodino fulfilled his office as
1|representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other
1|battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he
1|inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did
1|not contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the
1|field of battle, but with his great tact and military experience
1|carried out his role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIX
1|
1|
1|On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon
1|remarked:
1|
1|"The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!"
1|
1|Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him
1|about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress'
1|household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
1|relating to the court.
1|
1|He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset's love
1|of travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon
1|who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on
1|his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table.
1|"The matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head.
1|When the time comes to set to work I shall do it as no one else
1|could, but now I can jest, and the more I jest and the calmer I am the
1|more tranquil and confident you ought to be, and the more amazed at my
1|genius."
1|
1|Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest
1|before the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next
1|day. He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to
1|sleep, and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the
1|dampness of the evening, he went into the large division of the tent
1|at three o'clock in the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked
1|whether the Russians had not withdrawn, and was told that the
1|enemy's fires were still in the same places. He nodded approval.
1|
1|The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.
1|
1|"Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?" Napoleon
1|asked him.
1|
1|"Without doubt, sire," replied Rapp.
1|
1|Napoleon looked at him.
1|
1|"Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at
1|Smolensk?" continued Rapp. "The wine is drawn and must be drunk."
1|
1|Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head
1|on his hand.
1|
1|"This poor army!" he suddenly remarked. "It has diminished greatly
1|since Smolensk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always
1|said so and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the
1|Guards are intact?" he remarked interrogatively.
1|
1|"Yes, sire," replied Rapp.
1|
1|Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his
1|watch. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was
1|impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for
1|the orders had all been given and were now being executed.
1|
1|"Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of
1|the Guards?" asked Napoleon sternly.
1|
1|"Yes, sire."
1|
1|"The rice too?"
1|
1|Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor's order about the rice,
1|but Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing
1|that his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch.
1|Napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently
1|sipped his own.
1|
1|"I have neither taste nor smell," he remarked, sniffing at his glass.
1|"This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine--what is the good of
1|medicine when it can't cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges
1|but they don't help at all. What can doctors cure? One can't cure
1|anything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that,
1|it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend
1|itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with
1|remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a
1|certain time; the watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by
1|fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for
1|living, that is all."
1|
1|And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was
1|fond, Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.
1|
1|"Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?" asked he. "It is the
1|art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That's all."
1|
1|Rapp made no reply.
1|
1|"Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutuzov!" said Napoleon. "We
1|shall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three
1|weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments....
1|We shall see!"
1|
1|He looked at his watch. It was still only four o'clock. He did not
1|feel sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do.
1|He rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went
1|out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible
1|moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were
1|dimly burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of
1|the Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and
1|the rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to
1|take up their positions were clearly audible.
1|
1|Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires
1|and listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman
1|in a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had
1|drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon
1|stopped in front of him.
1|
1|"What year did you enter the service?" he asked with that
1|affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always
1|addressed the soldiers.
1|
1|The man answered the question.
1|
1|"Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?"
1|
1|"It has, Your Majesty."
1|
1|Napoleon nodded and walked away.
1|
1|
1|At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevardino.
1|
1|It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud
1|lay in the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out
1|in the faint morning light.
1|
1|On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died
1|away in the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a
1|third report shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed
1|solemnly near by on the right.
1|
1|The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang
1|out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.
1|
1|Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevardino Redoubt where he
1|dismounted. The game had begun.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXX
1|
1|
1|On returning to Gorki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre
1|ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the
1|morning, and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a
1|corner Boris had given up to him.
1|
1|Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already
1|left the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his
1|groom was shaking him.
1|
1|"Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!" he kept
1|repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without
1|looking at him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.
1|
1|"What? Has it begun? Is it time?" Pierre asked, waking up.
1|
1|"Hear the firing," said the groom, a discharged soldier. "All the
1|gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past
1|long ago."
1|
1|Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was
1|bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from
1|behind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still
1|half broken by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on
1|the dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on
1|the windows, the fence, and on Pierre's horses standing before the
1|hut. The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant
1|accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.
1|
1|"It's time, Count; it's time!" cried the adjutant.
1|
1|Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down
1|the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of
1|battle the day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there,
1|members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and
1|Kutuzov's gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his
1|gray nape sunk between his shoulders. He was looking through a field
1|glass down the highroad before him.
1|
1|Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before
1|him, spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired
1|from that spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of
1|troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting
1|rays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre,
1|cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of
1|rosy, golden tinted light and long dark shadows. The forest at the
1|farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious
1|stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was
1|silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valuevo by
1|the Smolensk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered
1|golden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be
1|seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was
1|vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all
1|was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodino and the hollows on
1|both sides of the Kolocha.
1|
1|Above the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of it, especially
1|to the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls
1|into the Kolocha, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve,
1|and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and
1|magically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns
1|mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through that
1|mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing back like
1|lightning from the water, from the dew, and from the bayonets of the
1|troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodino. A white
1|church could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of
1|huts in Borodino as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green
1|ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move,
1|as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in
1|the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino, so along the entire line
1|outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the
1|left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds
1|of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now
1|singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others dense,
1|which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over the
1|whole expanse.
1|
1|These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of
1|the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.
1|
1|"Puff!"--suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging
1|from violet into gray and milky white, and "boom!" came the report a
1|second later.
1|
1|"Puff! puff!"--and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending
1|together; and "boom, boom!" came the sounds confirming what the eye
1|had seen.
1|
1|Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a
1|round compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke
1|floating to one side, and--"puff" (with a pause)--"puff, puff!"
1|three and then four more appeared and then from each, with the same
1|interval--"boom--boom, boom!" came the fine, firm, precise sounds in
1|reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and
1|sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran
1|past them. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of
1|smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports,
1|while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the
1|muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had
1|their little echoes in just the same way. "Trakh-ta-ta-takh!" came the
1|frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in
1|comparison with the reports of the cannon.
1|
1|Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets,
1|that movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov and
1|his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They
1|were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed
1|to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining
1|with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before
1|and had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!" Kutuzov was
1|saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from
1|the battlefield.
1|
1|Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way
1|down the knoll.
1|
1|"To the crossing!" said the general coldly and sternly in reply to
1|one of the staff who asked where he was going.
1|
1|"I'll go there too, I too!" thought Pierre, and followed the
1|general.
1|
1|The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went
1|to his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the
1|quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out
1|his toes pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his
1|spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and
1|reins, he galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to
1|smile as they watched him from the knoll.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXI
1|
1|
1|Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping
1|turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped
1|in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to
1|pass either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were
1|soldiers everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy
1|with some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the
1|same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a
1|white hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them
1|under his horse's hoofs.
1|
1|"Why ride into the middle of the battalion?" one of them shouted
1|at him.
1|
1|Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,
1|bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying
1|horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.
1|
1|There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood
1|firing. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had
1|come to the bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino,
1|which the French (having occupied Borodino) were attacking in the
1|first phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front
1|of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it
1|and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken
1|no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but
1|despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this
1|was the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of the bullets
1|whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him,
1|did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long
1|time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him.
1|He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face.
1|
1|"Why's that fellow in front of the line?" shouted somebody at him
1|again.
1|
1|"To the left!... Keep to the right!" the men shouted to him.
1|
1|Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of
1|Raevski's adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at
1|him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing
1|him he nodded.
1|
1|"How have you got here?" he said, and galloped on.
1|
1|Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid
1|of getting in someone's way again, galloped after the adjutant.
1|
1|"What's happening here? May I come with you?" he asked.
1|
1|"One moment, one moment!" replied the adjutant, and riding up to a
1|stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message
1|and then addressed Pierre.
1|
1|"Why have you come here, Count?" he asked with a smile. "Still
1|inquisitive?"
1|
1|"Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
1|
1|But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.
1|
1|"Here it's tolerable," said he, "but with Bagration on the left
1|flank they're getting it frightfully hot."
1|
1|"Really?" said Pierre. "Where is that?"
1|
1|"Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and
1|in our battery it is still bearable," said the adjutant. "Will you
1|come?"
1|
1|"Yes, I'll come with you," replied Pierre, looking round for his
1|groom.
1|
1|It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or
1|being carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over
1|the day before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay,
1|with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.
1|
1|"Why haven't they carried him away?" Pierre was about to ask, but
1|seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking
1|that way, he checked himself.
1|
1|Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
1|adjutant to Raevski's Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the
1|adjutant's and jolted him at every step.
1|
1|"You don't seem to be used to riding, Count?" remarked the adjutant.
1|
1|"No it's not that, but her action seems so jerky," said Pierre in
1|a puzzled tone.
1|
1|"Why... she's wounded!" said the adjutant. "In the off foreleg above
1|the knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your
1|baptism of fire!"
1|
1|Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the
1|artillery which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening
1|them with the noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was
1|cool and quiet, with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant
1|dismounted and walked up the hill on foot.
1|
1|"Is the general here?" asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.
1|
1|"He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way," someone
1|told him, pointing to the right.
1|
1|The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.
1|
1|"Don't trouble about me," said Pierre. "I'll go up onto the knoll if
1|I may?"
1|
1|"Yes, do. You'll see everything from there and it's less
1|dangerous, and I'll come for you."
1|
1|Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not
1|meet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm
1|that day.
1|
1|The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards
1|known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski's Redoubt, and
1|to the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du
1|centre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French
1|regarded as the key to the whole position.
1|
1|This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which
1|trenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that
1|were being fired through openings in the earthwork.
1|
1|In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also
1|fired incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When
1|ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which
1|small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was
1|the most important point of the battle.
1|
1|On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought
1|it one of the least significant parts of the field.
1|
1|Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench
1|surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
1|an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about
1|the battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the
1|soldiers who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running
1|past him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being
1|fired continually one after another with a deafening roar,
1|enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke.
1|
1|In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in
1|support, here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their
1|work were separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced
1|a common and as it were family feeling of animation.
1|
1|The intrusion of Pierre's nonmilitary figure in a white hat made
1|an unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at
1|him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior
1|artillery officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over
1|to Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at
1|him with curiosity.
1|
1|A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only
1|just out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two
1|guns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.
1|
1|"Sir," he said, "permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not
1|be here."
1|
1|The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at
1|Pierre. But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the
1|white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of
1|the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the
1|soldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if
1|he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust gradually
1|began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers
1|feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that
1|live with the regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their
1|family, adopted him, gave him a nickname ("our gentleman"), and made
1|kindly fun of him among themselves.
1|
1|A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around
1|with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown
1|up.
1|
1|"And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?" a red-faced,
1|broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a
1|set of sound, white teeth.
1|
1|"Are you afraid, then?" said Pierre.
1|
1|"What else do you expect?" answered the soldier. "She has no
1|mercy, you know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards.
1|One can't help being afraid," he said laughing.
1|
1|Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.
1|They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and
1|the discovery that he did so delighted them.
1|
1|"It's the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it's
1|wonderful! There's a gentleman for you!"
1|
1|"To your places!" cried the young officer to the men gathered
1|round Pierre.
1|
1|The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the
1|first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and
1|the men with great precision and formality.
1|
1|The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing
1|more intense over the whole field, especially to the left where
1|Bagration's fleches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing
1|made it almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole
1|attention was engrossed by watching the family circle--separated
1|from all else--formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious
1|feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the
1|battlefield was now replaced by another, especially since he had
1|seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the
1|slope of the trench, he observed the faces of those around him.
1|
1|By ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from
1|the battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more
1|frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled
1|around. But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and
1|merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides.
1|
1|"A live one!" shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.
1|
1|"Not this way! To the infantry!" added another with loud laughter,
1|seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.
1|
1|"Are you bowing to a friend, eh?" remarked another, chaffing a
1|peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.
1|
1|Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out
1|to see what was happening in front.
1|
1|"They've withdrawn the front line, it has retired," said they,
1|pointing over the earthwork.
1|
1|"Mind your own business," an old sergeant shouted at them. "If
1|they've retired it's because there's work for them to do farther
1|back."
1|
1|And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a
1|shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.
1|
1|"To the fifth gun, wheel it up!" came shouts from one side.
1|
1|"Now then, all together, like bargees!" rose the merry voices of
1|those who were moving the gun.
1|
1|"Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman's hat off!" cried the
1|red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. "Awkward
1|baggage!" he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon
1|wheel and a man's leg.
1|
1|"Now then, you foxes!" said another, laughing at some militiamen
1|who, stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.
1|
1|"So this gruel isn't to your taste? Oh, you crows! You're scared!"
1|they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man
1|whose leg had been torn off.
1|
1|"There, lads... oh, oh!" they mimicked the peasants, "they don't
1|like it at all!"
1|
1|Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after
1|every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.
1|
1|As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly
1|and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in
1|opposition to what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire
1|growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men.
1|
1|Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned
1|to know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching
1|this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was
1|flaming up in the same way in his own soul.
1|
1|At ten o'clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in
1|front of the battery and along the Kamenka streamlet retreated. From
1|the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their
1|wounded on their muskets. A general with his suite came to the
1|battery, and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look
1|and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the
1|battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from
1|amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the
1|sound of a drum and shouts of command, and from the battery one saw
1|how those ranks of infantry moved forward.
1|
1|Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly
1|struck by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was
1|walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.
1|
1|The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their
1|long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few
1|minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back
1|from that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently
1|in the battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed.
1|Around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No
1|one any longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted
1|at for being in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid
1|strides from one gun to another with a frowning face. The young
1|officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more
1|scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned,
1|loaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave
1|little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs.
1|
1|The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire
1|which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing
1|beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his
1|shako, ran up to his superior.
1|
1|"I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left.
1|Are we to continue firing?" he asked.
1|
1|"Grapeshot!" the senior shouted, without answering the question,
1|looking over the wall of the trench.
1|
1|Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and
1|bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing.
1|Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre's eyes.
1|
1|One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the
1|earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these
1|sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery
1|soldiers shouting "Hurrah!" were running not forwards but backwards,
1|it seemed to Pierre.
1|
1|A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he
1|was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before
1|his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some
1|militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.
1|
1|"All with grapeshot!" shouted the officer.
1|
1|The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper
1|informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is
1|no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.
1|
1|"The scoundrels! What are they doing?" shouted the officer,
1|turning to Pierre.
1|
1|The officer's face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered
1|under his frowning brow.
1|
1|"Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!" he
1|yelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.
1|
1|"I'll go," said Pierre.
1|
1|The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite
1|side.
1|
1|"Don't fire.... Wait!" he shouted.
1|
1|The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"Eh, sir, this is no place for you," said he, and ran down the
1|slope.
1|
1|Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer
1|was sitting.
1|
1|One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in
1|front, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. "Where am
1|I going?" he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green
1|ammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to
1|return or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to
1|the ground. At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of
1|flame, and immediately a deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made
1|his ears tingle.
1|
1|When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on
1|his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer
1|existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched
1|grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it,
1|galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground,
1|uttering prolonged and piercing cries.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXII
1|
1|
1|Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the
1|battery, as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.
1|
1|On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing
1|something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery.
1|He had no time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior
1|officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were
1|examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had
1|noticed before was struggling forward shouting "Brothers!" and
1|trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the
1|arm. He also saw something else that was strange.
1|
1|But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed,
1|that the soldier shouting "Brothers!" was a prisoner, and that another
1|man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had
1|he run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in
1|a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something.
1|Instinctively guarding against the shock--for they had been running
1|together at full speed before they saw one another--Pierre put out his
1|hands and seized the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one
1|hand and by the throat with the other. The officer, dropping his
1|sword, seized Pierre by his collar.
1|
1|For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another's
1|unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and
1|what they were to do next. "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him
1|prisoner?" each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently
1|more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre's
1|strong hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever
1|tighter and tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when
1|just above their heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled,
1|and it seemed to Pierre that the French officer's head had been torn
1|off, so swiftly had he ducked it.
1|
1|Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further
1|thought as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to
1|the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead
1|and wounded who, it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he
1|reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian
1|soldiers who, stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and
1|wildly toward the battery. (This was the attack for which Ermolov
1|claimed the credit, declaring that only his courage and good luck made
1|such a feat possible: it was the attack in which he was said to have
1|thrown some St. George's Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery
1|for the first soldiers to take who got there.)
1|
1|The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops
1|shouting "Hurrah!" pursued them so far beyond the battery that it
1|was difficult to call them back.
1|
1|The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them
1|was a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds
1|of wounded--some known to Pierre and some unknown--Russians and
1|French, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were
1|carried on stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto
1|the knoll where he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle
1|which had received him as a member he did not find a single one. There
1|were many dead whom he did not know, but some he recognized. The young
1|officer still sat in the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood
1|at the edge of the earth wall. The red-faced man was still
1|twitching, but they did not carry him away.
1|
1|Pierre ran down the slope once more.
1|
1|"Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have
1|done!" he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
1|moving from the battlefield.
1|
1|But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front
1|and especially to the left, near Semenovsk, something seemed to be
1|seething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not
1|diminish, but even increased to desperation like a man who,
1|straining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXIII
1|
1|
1|The chief action of the battle of Borodino was fought within the
1|seven thousand feet between Borodino and Bagration's fleches. Beyond
1|that space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the
1|Russians with Uvarov's cavalry at midday, and on the other side,
1|beyond Utitsa, Poniatowski's collision with Tuchkov; but these two
1|were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in
1|the center of the battlefield. On the field between Borodino and the
1|fleches, beside the wood, the chief action of the day took place on an
1|open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest
1|and most artless way.
1|
1|The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
1|guns.
1|
1|Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,
1|Campan's and Dessaix's, advanced from the French right, while
1|Murat's troops advanced on Borodino from their left.
1|
1|From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the
1|fleches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as
1|the crow flies to Borodino, so that Napoleon could not see what was
1|happening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid
1|the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix's division advancing
1|against the fleches could only be seen till they had entered the
1|hollow that lay between them and the fleches. As soon as they had
1|descended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and musketry on
1|the fleches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that
1|side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something
1|black--probably men--and at times the glint of bayonets. But whether
1|they were moving or stationary, whether they were French or Russian,
1|could not be discovered from the Shevardino Redoubt.
1|
1|The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight
1|into Napoleon's face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked
1|at the fleches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it
1|looked as if the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved.
1|Sometimes shouts were heard through the firing, but it was
1|impossible to tell what was being done there.
1|
1|Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and
1|in its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and
1|sometimes Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he
1|could not tell where what he had seen was.
1|
1|He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.
1|
1|Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed
1|intently at the battlefield.
1|
1|But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from
1|where he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which
1|some of his generals had taken their stand, but even from the
1|fleches themselves--in which by this time there were now Russian and
1|now French soldiers, alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive,
1|frightened, or maddened--even at those fleches themselves it was
1|impossible to make out what was taking place. There for several
1|hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire, now Russians were
1|seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, and now cavalry: they
1|appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to do with one
1|another, screamed, and ran back again.
1|
1|From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
1|marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress
1|of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
1|impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any
1|given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the
1|actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others;
1|and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to
1|Napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already
1|becoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings
1|that Borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolocha was in
1|the hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished
1|the troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should
1|form up on the farther side and wait. But before that order was
1|given--almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodino--the
1|bridge had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very
1|skirmish at which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the
1|battle.
1|
1|An adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and
1|frightened face and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been
1|repulsed, Campan wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time
1|the adjutant had been told that the French had been repulsed, the
1|fleches had in fact been recaptured by other French troops, and Davout
1|was alive and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily
1|untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either
1|been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not
1|executed.
1|
1|The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle
1|but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and
1|only occasionally went within musket range, made their own
1|arrangements without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in
1|what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry
1|should run. But even their orders, like Napoleon's, were seldom
1|carried out, and then but partially. For the most part things happened
1|contrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on
1|meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they were,
1|suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed
1|back and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without orders in
1|pursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry regiments
1|galloped through the Semenovsk hollow and as soon as they reached
1|the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back
1|again. The infantry moved in the same way, sometimes running to
1|quite other places than those they were ordered to go to. All orders
1|as to where and when to move the guns, when to send infantry to
1|shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry--all such orders
1|were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned,
1|without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less Napoleon.
1|They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or
1|for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at stake
1|is what is dearest to man--his own life--and it sometimes seems that
1|safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these
1|men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the
1|mood of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward
1|and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops.
1|All their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the
1|harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that
1|flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about. As
1|soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying
1|about, their superiors, located in the background, re-formed them
1|and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that
1|discipline led them back to the zone of fire, where under the
1|influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about
1|according to the chance promptings of the throng.
1|

1|CHAPTER XXXIV
1|
1|
1|Napoleon's generals--Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that
1|region of fire and sometimes even entered it--repeatedly led into it
1|huge masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always
1|happened in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of
1|the enemy's flight, these orderly masses returned thence as
1|disorganized and terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but
1|their numbers constantly decreased. In the middle of the day Murat
1|sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.
1|
1|Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when
1|Murat's adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would
1|be routed if His Majesty would let him have another division.
1|
1|"Reinforcements?" said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking
1|at the adjutant--a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like
1|Murat's own--as though he did not understand his words.
1|
1|"Reinforcements!" thought Napoleon to himself. "How can they need
1|reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
1|weak, unentrenched Russian wing?"
1|
1|"Tell the King of Naples," said he sternly, "that it is not noon
1|yet, and I don't yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!..."
1|
1|The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
1|removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were
1|being slaughtered.
1|
1|Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began
1|talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.
1|
1|In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest
1|Napoleon, Berthier's eyes turned to look at a general with a suite,
1|who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was
1|Belliard. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid
1|strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity
1|of sending reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians
1|were lost if the Emperor would give another division.
1|
1|Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
1|without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
1|generals of the suite around him.
1|
1|"You are very fiery, Belliard," said Napoleon, when he again came up
1|to the general. "In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake.
1|Go and have another look and then come back to me."
1|
1|Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of
1|the battlefield galloped up.
1|
1|"Now then, what do you want?" asked Napoleon in the tone of a man
1|irritated at being continually disturbed.
1|
1|"Sire, the prince..." began the adjutant.
1|
1|"Asks for reinforcements?" said Napoleon with an angry gesture.
1|
1|The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but
1|the Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came
1|back, and called Berthier.
1|
1|"We must give reserves," he said, moving his arms slightly apart.
1|"Who do you think should be sent there?" he asked of Berthier (whom he
1|subsequently termed "that gosling I have made an eagle").
1|
1|"Send Claparede's division, sire," replied Berthier, who knew all
1|the divisions regiments, and battalions by heart.
1|
1|Napoleon nodded assent.
1|
1|The adjutant galloped to Claparede's division and a few minutes
1|later the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward.
1|Napoleon gazed silently in that direction.
1|
1|"No!" he suddenly said to Berthier. "I can't send Claparede. Send
1|Friant's division."
1|
1|Though there was no advantage in sending Friant's division instead
1|of Claparede's, and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in
1|stopping Claparede and sending Friant now, the order was carried out
1|exactly. Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was
1|playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines--a role he
1|so justly understood and condemned.
1|
1|Friant's division disappeared as the others had done into the
1|smoke of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive
1|at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all
1|asked for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding
1|their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the
1|French army was melting away.
1|
1|Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.
1|
1|M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since
1|morning, came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest
1|lunch to His Majesty.
1|
1|"I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?" said he.
1|
1|Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the
1|negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de
1|Beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is
1|no reason for not having lunch when one can get it.
1|
1|"Go away..." exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned
1|aside.
1|
1|A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M.
1|de Beausset's face and he glided away to the other generals.
1|
1|Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an
1|ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and
1|always winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances
1|of the game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely
1|he loses.
1|
1|His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same
1|preparations had been made, the same dispositions, and the same
1|proclamation courte et energique, he himself was still the same: he
1|knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and
1|skillful than before. Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and
1|Friedland--yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally
1|become impotent.
1|
1|All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with
1|success: the concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by
1|reserves to break the enemy's line, and a cavalry attack by "the men
1|of iron," all these methods had already been employed, yet not only
1|was there no victory, but from all sides came the same news of
1|generals killed and wounded, of reinforcements needed, of the
1|impossibility of driving back the Russians, and of disorganization
1|among his own troops.
1|
1|Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few
1|phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
1|congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the
1|corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon
1|and stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to
1|gather in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola,
1|Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was
1|happening to his troops.
1|
1|Despite news of the capture of the fleches, Napoleon saw that this
1|was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his
1|former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the
1|men about him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked
1|dejected, and they all shunned one another's eyes--only a de
1|Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening.
1|
1|But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning
1|of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all
1|efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and
1|that the least accident might now--with the fight balanced on such a
1|strained center--destroy him and his army.
1|
1|When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign
1|in which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or
1|cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he
1|looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard
1|reports of the Russians still holding their ground--a terrible feeling
1|like a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents
1|that might destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall
1|on his left wing, might break through his center, he himself might
1|be killed by a stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former
1|battles he had only considered the possibilities of success, but now
1|innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves, and he expected them
1|all. Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is
1|coming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a
1|terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels
1|that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of
1|unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness.
1|
1|The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the
1|French army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a
1|campstool below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees.
1|Berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line
1|to ascertain the position of affairs.
1|
1|"What? What do you say?" asked Napoleon. "Yes, tell them to bring me
1|my horse."
1|
1|He mounted and rode toward Semenovsk.
1|
1|Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space
1|through which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of
1|blood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals
1|had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small
1|area. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the
1|ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does
1|to tableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semenovsk,
1|and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color
1|unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.
1|
1|The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk village and its
1|knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
1|forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a
1|continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French
1|or the Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the
1|reverie from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what
1|was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed
1|by him and to depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair,
1|for the first time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.
1|
1|One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to
1|lead the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near
1|Napoleon, exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this
1|general's senseless offer.
1|
1|Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.
1|
1|"At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard
1|destroyed!" he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevardino.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXV
1|
1|
1|On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning
1|sat Kutuzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no
1|orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, do that," he replied to various proposals. "Yes, yes: go,
1|dear boy, and have a look," he would say to one or another of those
1|about him; or, "No, don't, we'd better wait!" He listened to the
1|reports that were brought him and gave directions when his
1|subordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports
1|it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words
1|spoken, but rather in something else--in the expression of face and
1|tone of voice of those who were reporting. By long years of military
1|experience he knew, and with the wisdom of age understood, that it
1|is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others
1|struggling with death, and he knew that the result of a battle is
1|decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where
1|the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of
1|slaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the
1|army, and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in
1|his power.
1|
1|Kutuzov's general expression was one of concentrated quiet
1|attention, and his face wore a strained look as if he found it
1|difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body.
1|
1|At eleven o'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by
1|the French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagration was wounded.
1|Kutuzov groaned and swayed his head.
1|
1|"Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about it exactly,"
1|he said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of
1|Wurttemberg who was standing behind him.
1|
1|"Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?"
1|
1|Soon after the duke's departure--before he could possibly have
1|reached Semenovsk--his adjutant came back from him and told Kutuzov
1|that the duke asked for more troops.
1|
1|Kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take over
1|the command of the first army, and a request to the duke--whom he said
1|he could not spare at such an important moment--to return to him. When
1|they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the
1|staff officers congratulated him, Kutuzov smiled.
1|
1|"Wait a little, gentlemen," said he. "The battle is won, and there
1|is nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is
1|better to wait before we rejoice."
1|
1|But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.
1|
1|When Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that
1|the French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk,
1|Kutuzov, guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin's
1|looks that the news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and,
1|taking Scherbinin's arm, led him aside.
1|
1|"Go, my dear fellow," he said to Ermolov, "and see whether something
1|can't be done."
1|
1|Kutuzov was in Gorki, near the center of the Russian position. The
1|attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several
1|times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond
1|Borodino, and on their left flank Uvarov's cavalry had put the
1|French to flight.
1|
1|Toward three o'clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of
1|all who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around
1|him, Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was
1|satisfied with the day's success--a success exceeding his
1|expectations, but the old man's strength was failing him. Several
1|times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off.
1|Dinner was brought him.
1|
1|Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince
1|Andrew had said, "the war should be extended widely," and whom
1|Bagration so detested, rode up while Kutuzov was at dinner. Wolzogen
1|had come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on
1|the left flank. The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of
1|wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army,
1|weighed all the circumstances, concluded that the battle was lost, and
1|sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news.
1|
1|Kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and
1|glanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering
1|lids.
1|
1|Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutuzov
1|with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak
1|of his cap.
1|
1|He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected
1|nonchalance intended to show that, as a highly trained military man,
1|he left it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but
1|that he knew whom he was dealing with. "Der alte Herr" (as in their
1|own set the Germans called Kutuzov) "is making himself very
1|comfortable," thought Wolzogen, and looking severely at the dishes
1|in front of Kutuzov he began to report to "the old gentleman" the
1|position of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to
1|and as he himself had seen and understood it.
1|
1|"All the points of our position are in the enemy's hands and we
1|cannot dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away
1|and it is impossible to stop them," he reported.
1|
1|Kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as if
1|not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing "the old
1|gentleman's" agitation, said with a smile:
1|
1|"I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness
1|what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder..."
1|
1|"You have seen? You have seen?..." Kutuzov shouted frowning, and
1|rising quickly he went up to Wolzogen.
1|
1|"How... how dare you!..." he shouted, choking and making a
1|threatening gesture with his trembling arms: "How dare you, sir, say
1|that to me? You know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me
1|that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the
1|battle is better known to me, the commander in chief, than to him."
1|
1|Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutuzov interrupted him.
1|
1|"The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right
1|flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say
1|what you don't know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and
1|inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow," said
1|Kutuzov sternly.
1|
1|All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy
1|breathing of the panting old general.
1|
1|"They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave
1|army! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the
1|sacred soil of Russia," said Kutuzov crossing himself, and he suddenly
1|sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.
1|
1|Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped
1|silently aside, marveling at "the old gentleman's" conceited
1|stupidity.
1|
1|"Ah, here he is, my hero!" said Kutuzov to a portly, handsome,
1|dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.
1|
1|This was Raevski, who had spent the whole day at the most
1|important part of the field of Borodino.
1|
1|Raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground
1|and that the French no longer ventured to attack.
1|
1|After hearing him, Kutuzov said in French:
1|
1|"Then you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?"
1|
1|"On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is
1|always the most stubborn who remain victors," replied Raevski, "and in
1|my opinion..."
1|
1|"Kaysarov!" Kutuzov called to his adjutant. "Sit down and write out
1|the order of the day for tomorrow. And you," he continued, addressing
1|another, "ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack."
1|
1|While Kutuzov was talking to Raevski and dictating the order of
1|the day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General
1|Barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field
1|marshal had given.
1|
1|Kutuzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the
1|order to be written out which the former commander in chief, to
1|avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.
1|
1|And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
1|throughout an army one and the same temper, known as "the spirit of
1|the army," and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutuzov's words,
1|his order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end
1|of the army to the other.
1|
1|It was far from being the same words or the same order that
1|reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth
1|to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what
1|Kutuzov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because
1|what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a
1|feeling that lay in the commander in chief's soul as in that of
1|every Russian.
1|
1|And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and
1|hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted
1|to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.

1|CHAPTER XXXVI
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew's regiment was among the reserves which till after one
1|o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk, under heavy
1|artillery fire. Toward two o'clock the regiment, having already lost
1|more than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled
1|oatfield in the gap between Semenovsk and the Knoll Battery, where
1|thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense,
1|concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between
1|one and two o'clock.
1|
1|Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment
1|here lost another third of its men. From in front and especially
1|from the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the
1|mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front,
1|quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly.
1|At times, as if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed
1|during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but
1|sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and
1|the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded
1|carried off.
1|
1|With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those
1|not yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three
1|hundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and
1|the same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely
1|heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of
1|a successful shot and the cry of "stretchers!" was heard. Most of
1|the time, by their officers' order, the men sat on the ground. One,
1|having taken off his shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its
1|lining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry clay
1|between his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap
1|and pulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and
1|refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again. Some built little
1|houses of the tufts in the plowed ground, or plaited baskets from
1|the straw in the cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these
1|pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers
1|went past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses of the
1|enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to
1|these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of
1|our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were heard
1|on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences
1|quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if the
1|minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,
1|commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front
1|of the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a
1|trace. "Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She'll
1|fall.... Ah, they don't see it!" came identical shouts from the
1|ranks all along the regiment. Another time, general attention was
1|attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which
1|trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail
1|stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped,
1|tucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and
1|shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But such
1|distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had
1|been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale
1|and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.
1|
1|Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment,
1|paced up and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge
1|of the meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind
1|his back. There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given.
1|Everything went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the
1|front, the wounded carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any
1|soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily. At
1|first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to rouse the courage of
1|the men and to set them an example, walked about among the ranks,
1|but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that
1|there was nothing he could teach them. All the powers of his soul,
1|as of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the
1|contemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the
1|meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the
1|dust that covered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to
1|the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his
1|steps, calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to
1|walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that
1|grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their
1|pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained of the previous
1|day's thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with weary ears
1|to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle of flying
1|projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely
1|familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited. "Here it
1|comes... this one is coming our way again!" he thought, listening to
1|an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. "One, another!
1|Again! It has hit...." He stopped and looked at the ranks. "No, it has
1|gone over. But this one has hit!" And again he started trying to reach
1|the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces
1|from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill
1|ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many had
1|been hit--a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.
1|
1|"Adjutant!" he shouted. "Order them not to crowd together."
1|
1|The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince
1|Andrew. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.
1|
1|"Look out!" came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird
1|whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell
1|dropped with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and
1|close to the battalion commander's horse. The horse first,
1|regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear, snorted,
1|reared almost throwing the major, and galloped aside. The horse's
1|terror infected the men.
1|
1|"Lie down!" cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.
1|
1|Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between
1|him and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the
1|field and the meadow.
1|
1|"Can this be death?" thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite
1|new, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of
1|smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball. "I cannot, I do not
1|wish to die. I love life--I love this grass, this earth, this air...."
1|He thought this, and at the same time remembered that people were
1|looking at him.
1|
1|"It's shameful, sir!" he said to the adjutant. "What..."
1|
1|He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the
1|sound of an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking
1|window frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started
1|to one side, raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several
1|officers ran up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood
1|was welling out making a large stain on the grass.
1|
1|The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the
1|officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,
1|breathing heavily and noisily.
1|
1|"What are you waiting for? Come along!"
1|
1|The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but
1|he moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.
1|
1|"Pick him up, lift him, it's all the same!" cried someone.
1|
1|They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.
1|
1|"Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My
1|God!"--voices among the officers were heard saying.
1|
1|"It flew a hair's breadth past my ear," said the adjutant.
1|
1|The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started
1|hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing
1|station.
1|
1|"Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!" shouted an officer, seizing by
1|their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly
1|and jolting the stretcher.
1|
1|"Get into step, Fedor... I say, Fedor!" said the foremost peasant.
1|
1|"Now that's right!" said the one behind joyfully, when he had got
1|into step.
1|
1|"Your excellency! Eh, Prince!" said the trembling voice of Timokhin,
1|who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.
1|
1|Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from
1|the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his
1|eyelids drooped.
1|
1|
1|The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the
1|wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of
1|three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch
1|wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were
1|eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and
1|pecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among
1|the birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than
1|five acres, bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay.
1|Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with
1|dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in
1|vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers' orders, the
1|soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently,
1|as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking
1|place before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now
1|plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or
1|to point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men
1|awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed,
1|swore, or asked for vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew's
1|bearers, stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took
1|him, as a regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there
1|stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and
1|for a long time could not make out what was going on around him. He
1|remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black
1|ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps from
1|him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting
1|general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired
1|noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in
1|the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his
1|talk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.
1|
1|"We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we
1|grabbed the King himself!" cried he, looking around him with eyes that
1|glittered with fever. "If only reserves had come up just then, lads,
1|there wouldn't have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely..."
1|
1|Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him
1|with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. "But isn't it
1|all the same now?" thought he. "And what will be there, and what has
1|there been here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was
1|something in this life I did not and do not understand."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXVII
1|
1|
1|One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,
1|holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his
1|small bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head
1|and looked about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He
1|evidently wanted a little respite. After turning his head from right
1|to left for some time, he sighed and looked down.
1|
1|"All right, immediately," he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince
1|Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.
1|
1|Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.
1|
1|"It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have
1|a chance!" remarked one.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only
1|just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince
1|Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent. The
1|pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh,
1|stomach, and back distracted him. All he saw about him merged into a
1|general impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill
1|the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks previously, on that hot
1|August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the
1|Smolensk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same chair a canon, the
1|sight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a
1|presentiment.
1|
1|There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied,
1|and on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he
1|was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on
1|the other two tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a
1|Cossack, judging by the uniform thrown down beside him. Four
1|soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was cutting into
1|his muscular brown back.
1|
1|"Ooh, ooh, ooh!" grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his
1|swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white
1|teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing,
1|ringing, and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many
1|people were crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his
1|head thrown back. His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head
1|seemed strangely familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were
1|pressing on his chest to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg
1|twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor. The man was
1|sobbing and choking convulsively. Two doctors--one of whom was pale
1|and trembling--were silently doing something to this man's other, gory
1|leg. When he had finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an
1|overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his
1|hands.
1|
1|He glanced at Prince Andrew's face and quickly turned away.
1|
1|"Undress him! What are you waiting for?" he cried angrily to the
1|dressers.
1|
1|His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to
1|Prince Andrew's mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began
1|hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The
1|doctor bent down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he
1|made a sign to someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused
1|Prince Andrew to lose consciousness. When he came to himself the
1|splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted, the torn
1|flesh cut away, and the wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on
1|his face. As soon as Prince Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent
1|over, kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away.
1|
1|After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a
1|blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All
1|the best and happiest moments of his life--especially his earliest
1|childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when
1|leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head
1|in the pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life--returned
1|to his memory, not merely as something past but as something present.
1|
1|The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of
1|whose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him
1|up and trying to quiet him.
1|
1|"Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!" his frightened moans
1|could be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.
1|
1|Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep.
1|Whether because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to
1|part with life, or because of those memories of a childhood that could
1|not return, or because he was suffering and others were suffering
1|and that man near him was groaning so piteously--he felt like
1|weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears.
1|
1|The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted
1|blood and with the boot still on.
1|
1|"Oh! Oh, ooh!" he sobbed, like a woman.
1|
1|The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince
1|Andrew from seeing his face, moved away.
1|
1|"My God! What is this? Why is he here?" said Prince Andrew to
1|himself.
1|
1|In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been
1|amputated, he recognized Anatole Kuragin. Men were supporting him in
1|their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling,
1|swollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully.
1|"Yes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully
1|connected with me," thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping
1|what he saw before him. "What is the connection of that man with my
1|childhood and life?" he asked himself without finding an answer. And
1|suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving
1|childhood presented itself to him. He remembered Natasha as he had
1|seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810, with her slender neck
1|and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture, and
1|love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever,
1|awoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed
1|between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears
1|that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic
1|pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.
1|
1|Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender
1|loving tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and
1|their errors.
1|
1|"Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for
1|those who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God
1|preached on earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not
1|understand--that is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what
1|remained for me had I lived. But now it is too late. I know it!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXVIII
1|
1|
1|The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and
1|wounded, together with the heaviness of his head and the news that
1|some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded,
1|and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm,
1|produced an unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to
1|look at the killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his
1|strength of mind. This day the horrible appearance of the
1|battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought
1|constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from the
1|battlefield and returned to the Shevardino knoll, where he sat on
1|his campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his
1|nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast
1|eyes, to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the
1|end of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant
1|and which he was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a
1|brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he
1|had served so long. He felt in his own person the sufferings and death
1|he had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and
1|chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for
1|himself. At that moment he did not desire Moscow, or victory, or glory
1|(what need had he for any more glory?). The one thing he wished for
1|was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he had been on the
1|Semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring
1|several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the
1|fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo. Napoleon had
1|assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of
1|the effect those batteries produced.
1|
1|An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
1|had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that
1|they still held their ground.
1|
1|"Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on," said
1|the adjutant.
1|
1|"They want more!..." said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.
1|
1|"Sire?" asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.
1|
1|"They want more!" croaked Napoleon frowning. "Let them have it!"
1|
1|Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and
1|for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of
1|him, was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of
1|imaginary greatness, and again--as a horse walking a treadmill
1|thinks it is doing something for itself--he submissively fulfilled the
1|cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.
1|
1|And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
1|darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
1|lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the
1|end of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the
1|significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
1|truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to
1|grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as
1|they were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth,
1|goodness, and all humanity.
1|
1|Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with
1|men killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as
1|he looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,
1|deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that
1|there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone
1|did he write in a letter to Paris that "the battle field was
1|superb," because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the
1|island of St. Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he
1|intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had
1|done, he wrote:
1|
1|
1|The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern
1|times: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the
1|tranquillity and security of all; it was purely pacific and
1|conservative.
1|
1|It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the
1|beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening
1|out, full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system
1|was already founded; all that remained was to organize it.
1|
1|Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I
1|too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were
1|stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
1|discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account
1|to the peoples as clerk to master.
1|
1|Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people,
1|and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in
1|the common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all
1|navigable rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all,
1|and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to
1|mere guards for the sovereigns.
1|
1|On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong,
1|magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have
1|proclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely
1|defensive, all aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated
1|my son in the Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and
1|his constitutional reign would have begun.
1|
1|Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the
1|envy of the nations!
1|
1|My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company
1|with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to
1|leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country
1|couple, every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing
1|wrongs, and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all
1|sides and everywhere.
1|
1|
1|Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of
1|executioner of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his
1|actions had been the peoples' welfare and that he could control the
1|fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions.
1|
1|
1|"Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula," he wrote further
1|of the Russian war, "half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,
1|Bavarians, Wurttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and
1|Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third
1|composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,
1|Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the
1|Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on:
1|it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French.
1|The Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand
1|men; the Russian army in its retreat from Vilna to Moscow lost in
1|the various battles four times more men than the French army; the
1|burning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who
1|died of cold and want in the woods; finally, in its march from
1|Moscow to the Oder the Russian army also suffered from the severity of
1|the season; so that by the time it reached Vilna it numbered
1|only fifty thousand, and at Kalisch less than eighteen thousand."
1|
1|
1|He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the
1|horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the
1|whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found
1|justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
1|perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXIX
1|
1|
1|Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
1|various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Davydov
1|family and to the crown serfs--those fields and meadows where for
1|hundreds of years the peasants of Borodino, Gorki, Shevardino, and
1|Semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At
1|the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a
1|space of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms,
1|wounded and unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves
1|back to Mozhaysk from the one army and back to Valuevo from the other.
1|Other crowds, exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their
1|officers. Others held their ground and continued to fire.
1|
1|Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter
1|of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now
1|spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of
1|saltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall
1|on the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, and
1|hesitating men, as if to say: "Enough, men! Enough! Cease... bethink
1|yourselves! What are you doing?"
1|
1|To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,
1|it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to
1|slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the
1|question arose in every soul: "For what, for whom, must I kill and
1|be killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don't want to
1|do so anymore!" By evening this thought had ripened in every soul.
1|At any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what
1|they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away
1|anywhere.
1|
1|But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the
1|horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to
1|leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to
1|control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed,
1|and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of
1|every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue,
1|perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls flew
1|just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies,
1|and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but
1|at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.
1|
1|Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would
1|have said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it
1|would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army
1|would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight
1|effort and the French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor
1|the Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly
1|out.
1|
1|The Russians did not make that effort because they were not
1|attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood
1|blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the
1|battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians
1|been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have
1|made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken
1|up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the
1|battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE
1|HALF of their army.
1|
1|The French, with the memory of all their former victories during
1|fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon's invincibility, with
1|the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and
1|had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards
1|intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort.
1|The French who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from
1|its position ought to have made that effort, for as long as the
1|Russians continued to block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of
1|the French had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were
1|in vain. But the French did not make that effort. Some historians say
1|that Napoleon need only have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and
1|the battle would have been won. To speak of what would have happened
1|had Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of what would happen if
1|autumn became spring. It could not be. Napoleon did not give his
1|Guards, not because he did not want to, but because it could not be
1|done. All the generals, officers, and soldiers of the French army knew
1|it could not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops would
1|not permit it.
1|
1|It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
1|of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and
1|soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,
1|after all their experience of previous battles--when after one tenth
1|of such efforts the enemy had fled--experienced a similar feeling of
1|terror before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as
1|threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The
1|moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted. Not that
1|sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of
1|material fastened to sticks, called standards, and of the ground on
1|which the troops had stood and were standing, but a moral victory that
1|convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of
1|his own impotence was gained by the Russians at Borodino. The French
1|invaders, like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received
1|a mortal wound, felt that they were perishing, but could not stop, any
1|more than the Russian army, weaker by one half, could help swerving.
1|By impetus gained, the French army was still able to roll forward to
1|Moscow, but there, without further effort on the part of the Russians,
1|it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at
1|Borodino. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was
1|Napoleon's senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old
1|Smolensk road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred
1|thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at
1|Borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit
1|had been laid.

1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human
1|mind. Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only
1|when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but
1|at the same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the
1|arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements.
1|There is a well known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in
1|this, that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was
1|following, in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast
1|as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the distance that
1|separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of
1|that distance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth,
1|the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so on forever.
1|This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that
1|Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that
1|motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements, whereas
1|the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.
1|
1|By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only
1|approach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we
1|have admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the
1|resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth,
1|and have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we reach
1|a solution of the problem.
1|
1|A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing
1|with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more
1|complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.
1|
1|This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when
1|dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the
1|infinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion
1|(absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error
1|which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements
1|of motion instead of examining continuous motion.
1|
1|In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing
1|happens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable
1|arbitrary human wills, is continuous.
1|
1|To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
1|history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all
1|those human wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
1|units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily
1|selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others,
1|though there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event
1|always flows uninterruptedly from another.
1|
1|The second method is to consider the actions of some one man--a king
1|or a commander--as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills;
1|whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity
1|of a single historic personage.
1|
1|Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth
1|continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But
1|however small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit
1|disconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any
1|phenomenon, or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the
1|actions of any one historic personage, is in itself false.
1|
1|It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any
1|deductions drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some
1|larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation--as criticism has
1|every right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must
1|always be arbitrarily selected.
1|
1|Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the
1|differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men)
1|and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum
1|of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.
1|
1|The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe
1|present an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave
1|their customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other,
1|plunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair,
1|and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an
1|intensive movement which first increases and then slackens. What was
1|the cause of this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the
1|mind of man.
1|
1|The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings
1|and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris,
1|calling these sayings and doings "the Revolution"; then they give a
1|detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or
1|hostile to him; tell of the influence some of these people had on
1|others, and say: that is why this movement took place and those are
1|its laws.
1|
1|But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation,
1|but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious,
1|because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger.
1|The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and
1|only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.
1|
1|"But every time there have been conquests there have been
1|conquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any state
1|there have been great men," says history. And, indeed, human reason
1|replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this
1|does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is
1|possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a
1|single man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten,
1|I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells
1|begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right
1|to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position
1|of the hands of the watch.
1|
1|Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and
1|see the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to
1|conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of
1|the movement of the engine.
1|
1|The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the
1|oaks are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when
1|the oak is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold
1|winds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the
1|peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold
1|wind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I
1|see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the
1|phenomena of life, and I see that however much and however carefully I
1|observe the hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the
1|engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells
1|ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I
1|must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the
1|movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do
1|the same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.
1|
1|To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
1|our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and
1|study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses
1|are moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance
1|in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is
1|evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
1|the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much
1|mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
1|been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,
1|and ministers and propounding the historians' own reflections
1|concerning these actions.

1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The
1|Russian army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk was reached,
1|and again from Smolensk to Borodino. The French army pushed on to
1|Moscow, its goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim,
1|just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches
1|the earth. Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken,
1|hostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its
1|goal. Every soldier in Napoleon's army felt this and the invasion
1|moved on by its own momentum.
1|
1|The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of
1|hatred of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army
1|increased and consolidated. At Borodino a collision took place.
1|Neither army was broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately
1|after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding
1|with another having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability
1|the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on
1|for some distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its
1|force.
1|
1|The Russians retreated eighty miles--to beyond Moscow--and the
1|French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks
1|after that there was not a single battle. The French did not move.
1|As a bleeding, mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained
1|inert in Moscow for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh
1|reason, fled back: they made a dash for the Kaluga road, and (after
1|a victory--for at Malo-Yaroslavets the field of conflict again
1|remained theirs) without undertaking a single serious battle, they
1|fled still more rapidly back to Smolensk, beyond Smolensk, beyond
1|the Berezina, beyond Vilna, and farther still.
1|
1|On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutuzov and the
1|whole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino was a
1|victory. Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare
1|for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive
1|anyone, but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who
1|had taken part in the battle knew it.
1|
1|But all that evening and next day reports came in one after
1|another of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a
1|fresh battle proved physically impossible.
1|
1|It was impossible to give battle before information had been
1|collected, the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition
1|replenished, the slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to
1|replace those who had been killed, and before the men had had food and
1|sleep. And meanwhile, the very next morning after the battle, the
1|French army advanced of itself upon the Russians, carried forward by
1|the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse
1|proportion to the square of the distance from its aim. Kutuzov's
1|wish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired to do so.
1|But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there
1|must also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not
1|exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day's march, and then in the
1|same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day's
1|march, and at last, on the first of September when the army drew
1|near Moscow--despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in
1|all ranks--the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond
1|Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day's march, and
1|abandoned Moscow to the enemy.
1|
1|For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
1|made by generals--as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may
1|imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle--the
1|questions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov during the retreat not
1|do this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching
1|Fili? Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga road, abandoning
1|Moscow? and so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or
1|do not know, the inevitable conditions which always limit the
1|activities of any commander in chief. The activity of a commander in
1|chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves
1|when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map,
1|with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain
1|known locality, and begin our plans from some given moment. A
1|commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any
1|event--the position from which we always contemplate it. The commander
1|in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so
1|he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that
1|is occurring. Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping
1|itself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping
1|of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex
1|play of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects,
1|counsels, threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply
1|to innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict
1|with one another.
1|
1|Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutuzov
1|should have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before reaching
1|Fili, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But
1|a commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always
1|before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these
1|proposals, based on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.
1|
1|A commander in chief's business, it would seem, is simply to
1|choose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and
1|time do not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested
1|to him to cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an adjutant
1|gallops up from Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French
1|or retire. An order must be given him at once, that instant. And the
1|order to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kaluga road. And
1|after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the
1|stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where
1|the wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter
1|from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of
1|abandoning Moscow, and the commander in chief's rival, the man who
1|is undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several
1|such), presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning
1|to the Kaluga road, and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and
1|refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has
1|been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain,
1|and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an
1|officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite
1|contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a
1|prisoner, and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe
1|the position of the enemy's army differently. People accustomed to
1|misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a
1|commander in chief's actions describe to us, for instance, the
1|position of the army at Fili and assume that the commander in chief
1|could, on the first of September, quite freely decide whether to
1|abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less
1|than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that
1|question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolensk and most palpably
1|of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevardino and on the
1|twenty-sixth at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of the
1|retreat from Borodino to Fili.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|When Ermolov, having been sent by Kutuzov to inspect the position,
1|told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before
1|Moscow and that they must retreat, Kutuzov looked at him in silence.
1|
1|"Give me your hand," said he and, turning it over so as to feel
1|the pulse, added: "You are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you
1|are saying!"
1|
1|Kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond
1|Moscow without a battle.
1|
1|On the Poklonny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomilov gate of
1|Moscow, Kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the
1|roadside. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count
1|Rostopchin, who had come out from Moscow, joined them. This
1|brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed
1|the advantages and disadvantages of the position, the state of the
1|army, the plans suggested, the situation of Moscow, and military
1|questions generally. Though they had not been summoned for the
1|purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this
1|was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public
1|questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a
1|whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or
1|laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They
1|evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the
1|situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among
1|themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench
1|formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might
1|overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being
1|said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not
1|himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After
1|hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he
1|generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they
1|were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the
1|position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself
1|so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others
1|argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should
1|have been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle
1|of Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived
1|Frenchman in a Spanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one of the
1|German princes serving with the Russian army were discussing the siege
1|of Saragossa and considering the possibility of defending Moscow in
1|a similar manner.) Count Rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he
1|was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the
1|capital, but that he still could not help regretting having been
1|left in ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it
1|sooner things would have been different.... A fifth group,
1|displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed
1|the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group was
1|talking absolute nonsense. Kutuzov's expression grew more and more
1|preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that
1|to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
1|those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any
1|senseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would
1|result but the battle would still not take place. It would not take
1|place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to
1|be impossible, but in their conversations were only discussing what
1|would happen after its inevitable abandonment. How could the
1|commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered
1|impossible to hold? The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers
1|(who too reason) also considered the position impossible and therefore
1|could not go to fight, fully convinced as they were of defeat. If
1|Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still
1|discussed it, the question was no longer important in itself but
1|only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This Kutuzov knew well.
1|
1|Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian
1|patriotism (Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing) by
1|insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as
1|daylight to Kutuzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on
1|Kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without
1|giving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if
1|battle were not given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning
1|Moscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man's mind. One
1|terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no
1|reply from anyone. The question for him now was: "Have I really
1|allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it
1|decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Platov to
1|retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told
1|Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when
1|was this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army
1|must retreat and the order to do so must be given." To give that
1|terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of
1|the army. And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed
1|(the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovski, under whom he had served
1|in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to
1|save Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor's wish and by
1|the will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief. He
1|was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in
1|these difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he alone
1|could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and he was
1|horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something
1|had to be decided, and these conversations around him which were
1|assuming too free a character must be stopped.
1|
1|He called the most important generals to him.
1|
1|"My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself," said he, rising
1|from the bench, and he rode to Fili where his carriages were waiting.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in
1|the better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyanov's hut. The men,
1|women, and children of the large peasant family crowded into the
1|back room across the passage. Only Malasha, Andrew's six-year-old
1|granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had
1|given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea, remained on the top of
1|the brick oven in the larger room. Malasha looked down from the oven
1|with shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and decorations of the
1|generals, who one after another came into the room and sat down on the
1|broad benches in the corner under the icons. "Granddad" himself, as
1|Malasha in her own mind called Kutuzov, sat apart in a dark corner
1|behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and
1|continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat
1|which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those
1|who entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the
1|hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kaysarov was about to
1|draw back the curtain of the window facing Kutuzov, but the latter
1|moved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood that his Serene
1|Highness did not wish his face to be seen.
1|
1|Round the peasant's deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils,
1|and papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in
1|another bench and put it beside the table. Ermolov, Kaysarov, and
1|Toll, who had just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost
1|place, immediately under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high
1|forehead merging into his bald crown. He had a St. George's Cross
1|round his neck and looked pale and ill. He had been feverish for two
1|days and was now shivering and in pain. Beside him sat Uvarov, who
1|with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information, speaking in
1|low tones as they all did. Chubby little Dokhturov was listening
1|attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach. On
1|the other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolstoy, seemingly absorbed in
1|his own thoughts. His broad head with its bold features and glittering
1|eyes was resting on his hand. Raevski, twitching forward the black
1|hair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kutuzov and now
1|at the door with a look of impatience. Konovnitsyn's firm, handsome,
1|and kindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met
1|Malasha's, and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to
1|smile.
1|
1|They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of
1|inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited
1|for him from four till six o'clock and did not begin their
1|deliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters.
1|
1|Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutuzov leave his corner
1|and draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that
1|had been placed there to light up his face.
1|
1|Bennigsen opened the council with the question: "Are we to abandon
1|Russia's ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to
1|defend it?" A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a
1|frown on every face and only Kutuzov's angry grunts and occasional
1|cough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malasha too
1|looked at "Granddad." She was nearest to him and saw how his face
1|puckered; he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
1|
1|"Russia's ancient and sacred capital!" he suddenly said, repeating
1|Bennigsen's words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to
1|the false note in them. "Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that
1|that question has no meaning for a Russian." (He lurched his heavy
1|body forward.) "Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The
1|question I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military
1|one. The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up
1|Moscow without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the
1|army as well as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your
1|opinion," and he sank back in his chair.
1|
1|The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game
1|lost. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle
1|at Fili was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the
1|love of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the
1|left flank during the night and attack the French right flank the
1|following day. Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced
1|for and against that project. Ermolov, Dokhturov, and Raevski agreed
1|with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice
1|before abandoning the capital or guided by other, personal
1|considerations, these generals seemed not to understand that this
1|council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that
1|Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, however,
1|understood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, spoke of the
1|direction the army should take in its retreat. Malasha, who kept her
1|eyes fixed on what was going on before her, understood the meaning
1|of the council differently. It seemed to her that it was only a
1|personal struggle between "Granddad" and "Long-coat" as she termed
1|Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one
1|another, and in her heart she sided with "Granddad." In the midst of
1|the conversation she noticed "Granddad" give Bennigsen a quick, subtle
1|glance, and then to her joys he saw that "Granddad" said something
1|to "Long-coat" which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and
1|paced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kutuzov's
1|calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen's
1|proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to
1|attack the French right wing.
1|
1|"Gentlemen," said Kutuzov, "I cannot approve of the count's plan.
1|Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous,
1|and military history supports that view. For instance..." Kutuzov
1|seemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear,
1|naive look at Bennigsen he added: "Oh yes; take the battle of
1|Friedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was...
1|not fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near
1|the enemy..."
1|
1|There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them
1|all.
1|
1|The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and
1|they all felt that there was no more to be said.
1|
1|During one of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if
1|preparing to speak. They all looked at him.
1|
1|"Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the
1|broken crockery," said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table.
1|"Gentlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with
1|me. But I," he paused, "by the authority entrusted to me by my
1|Sovereign and country, order a retreat."
1|
1|After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
1|circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.
1|
1|Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different
1|from the way they had spoken during the council, communicated
1|something to their commander in chief.
1|
1|Malasha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully
1|backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its
1|projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she
1|darted out of the room.
1|
1|When he had dismissed the generals Kutuzov sat a long time with
1|his elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible
1|question: "When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable?
1|When was that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame
1|for it?"
1|
1|"I did not expect this," said he to his adjutant Schneider when
1|the latter came in late that night. "I did not expect this! I did
1|not think this would happen."
1|
1|"You should take some rest, your Serene Highness," replied
1|Schneider.
1|
1|"But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!" exclaimed
1|Kutuzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist.
1|"They shall too, if only..."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|At that very time, in circumstances even more important than
1|retreating without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of
1|Moscow, Rostopchin, who is usually represented as being the instigator
1|of that event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kutuzov.
1|
1|After the battle of Borodino the abandonment and burning of Moscow
1|was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without
1|fighting.
1|
1|Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the
1|feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.
1|
1|The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the
1|towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolensk, without
1|the participation of Count Rostopchin and his broadsheets. The
1|people awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited
1|or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the
1|strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment.
1|And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away
1|abandoning their property, while the poorer remained and burned and
1|destroyed what was left.
1|
1|The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was
1|and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of
1|this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in
1|Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already
1|in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this.
1|Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their
1|houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism
1|which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one's children to
1|save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively,
1|simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the
1|most powerful results.
1|
1|"It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running
1|away from Moscow," they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchin
1|impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed
1|to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
1|it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that
1|Rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had
1|committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the
1|rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had
1|remained intact and that during Napoleon's occupation the
1|inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the
1|charming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially the Russian
1|ladies, then liked so much.
1|
1|They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to
1|whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It
1|was out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst
1|thing that could happen. They went away even before the battle of
1|Borodino and still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchin's calls
1|to defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the
1|wonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or
1|of the balloons that were to destroy the French, and despite all the
1|nonsense Rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets. They knew that it was
1|for the army to fight, and that if it could not succeed it would not
1|do to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter
1|of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that they must go away, sorry as they
1|were to abandon their property to destruction. They went away
1|without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and
1|wealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with
1|wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be
1|burned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was only in
1|consequence of their going away that the momentous event was
1|accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian
1|people. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopchin's
1|orders, had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women
1|jesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate, with a vague
1|consciousness that she was not Bonaparte's servant, was really,
1|simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia.
1|But Count Rostopchin, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now
1|had the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless
1|weapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the
1|icons, and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics
1|of saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one
1|hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being
1|constructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and
1|related how he had set fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation
1|to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his
1|Orphanage; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn
1|Moscow and now repudiated the deed; now ordered the people to catch
1|all spies and bring them to him, and now reproached them for doing so;
1|now expelled all the French residents from Moscow, and now allowed
1|Madame Aubert-Chalme (the center of the whole French colony in Moscow)
1|to remain, but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyucharev to be
1|arrested and exiled for no particular offense; now assembled the
1|people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now, to get rid of
1|them, handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by
1|a back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of
1|Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share
1|in the affair--this man did not understand the meaning of what was
1|happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would
1|astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a
1|child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event--the
1|abandonment and burning of Moscow--and tried with his puny hand now to
1|speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him along
1|with it.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Helene, having returned with the court from Vilna to Petersburg,
1|found herself in a difficult position.
1|
1|In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee
1|who occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In Vilna she
1|had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she
1|returned to Petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there, and
1|both claimed their rights. Helene was faced by a new problem--how to
1|preserve her intimacy with both without offending either.
1|
1|What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman
1|did not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezukhova, who
1|evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had
1|she attempted concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her
1|awkward position by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by
1|acknowledging herself guilty. But Helene, like a really great man
1|who can do whatever he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be
1|correct, as she sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else
1|was to blame.
1|
1|The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach
1|her, she lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said
1|firmly: "That's just like a man--selfish and cruel! I expected nothing
1|else. A woman sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her
1|reward! What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my
1|attachments and friendships? He is a man who has been more than a
1|father to me!" The prince was about to say something, but Helene
1|interrupted him.
1|
1|"Well, yes," said she, "it may be that he has other sentiments for
1|me than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut
1|my door on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with
1|ingratitude! Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my
1|intimate feelings I render account only to God and to my
1|conscience," she concluded, laying her hand on her beautiful, fully
1|expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.
1|
1|"But for heaven's sake listen to me!"
1|
1|"Marry me, and I will be your slave!"
1|
1|"But that's impossible."
1|
1|"You won't deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you..." said
1|Helene, beginning to cry.
1|
1|The prince tried to comfort her, but Helene, as if quite distraught,
1|said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,
1|that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but
1|she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she
1|had never been her husband's wife, and that she had been sacrificed.
1|
1|"But the law, religion..." said the prince, already yielding.
1|
1|"The law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can't
1|arrange that?" said Helene.
1|
1|The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred
1|to him, and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the
1|Society of Jesus, with whom he was on intimate terms.
1|
1|A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Helene
1|gave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur
1|de Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant
1|black eyes, a Jesuit a robe courte* was presented to her, and in the
1|garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music
1|talked to her for a long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the
1|Sacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion
1|affords in this world and the next. Helene was touched, and more
1|than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur de Jobert
1|and their voices trembled. A dance, for which her partner came to seek
1|her, put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de
1|conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to see Helene
1|when she was alone, and after that often came again.
1|
1|
1|*Lay member of the Society of Jesus.
1|
1|
1|One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she
1|knelt down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting,
1|middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself
1|afterward described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze
1|wafted into her soul. It was explained to her that this was la grace.
1|
1|After that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her. She confessed
1|to him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box
1|containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to
1|partake of. A few days later Helene learned with pleasure that she had
1|now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days
1|the Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain
1|document.
1|
1|All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the
1|attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such
1|pleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now
1|in (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave
1|her pleasure, but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to
1|forget her aim. And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a
1|stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones, Helene--having
1|realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble
1|was, after converting her to Catholicism, to obtain money from her for
1|Jesuit institutions (as to which she received indications)-before
1|parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary
1|to free her from her husband should be performed. In her view the aim
1|of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while
1|affording satisfaction to human desires. And with this aim, in one of
1|her talks with her Father Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the
1|question, in how far was she bound by her marriage?
1|
1|They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.
1|The scent of flowers came in at the window. Helene was wearing a white
1|dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbe, a
1|well-fed man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth,
1|and white hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Helene and,
1|with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at
1|her beauty, occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his
1|opinion on the subject. Helene with an uneasy smile looked at his
1|curly hair and his plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every
1|moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbe,
1|though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was
1|absorbed in his mastery of the matter.
1|
1|The course of the Father Confessor's arguments ran as follows:
1|"Ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow
1|of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married
1|state without faith in the religious significance of marriage,
1|committed an act of sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual
1|significance it should have had. Yet in spite of this your vow was
1|binding. You swerved from it. What did you commit by so acting? A
1|venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you acted without evil
1|intention. If now you married again with the object of bearing
1|children, your sin might be forgiven. But the question is again a
1|twofold one: firstly..."
1|
1|But suddenly Helene, who was getting bored, said with one of her
1|bewitching smiles: "But I think that having espoused the true religion
1|I cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me."
1|
1|The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
1|presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus' egg. He was
1|delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil's progress, but
1|could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously
1|constructed.
1|
1|"Let us understand one another, Countess," said he with a smile, and
1|began refuting his spiritual daughter's arguments.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from
1|the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making
1|difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the
1|matter would be regarded by the secular authorities.
1|
1|So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of
1|society. She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him
1|what she had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so
1|that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her.
1|The elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this
1|suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive, as the
1|younger man had been, but Helene's imperturbable conviction that it
1|was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him
1|too. Had Helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation, shame,
1|or secrecy, her cause would certainly have been lost; but not only did
1|she show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the contrary, with
1|good-natured naivete she told her intimate friends (and these were all
1|Petersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her
1|and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.
1|
1|A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Helene wanted
1|to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would
1|have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the
1|unfortunate and interesting Helene was in doubt which of the two men
1|she should marry. The question was no longer whether this was
1|possible, but only which was the better match and how the matter would
1|be regarded at court. There were, it is true, some rigid individuals
1|unable to rise to the height of such a question, who saw in the
1|project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, but there were not
1|many such and they remained silent, while the majority were interested
1|in Helene's good fortune and in the question which match would be
1|the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to remarry
1|while one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question
1|had evidently been settled by people "wiser than you or me," as they
1|said, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk
1|exposing one's stupidity and incapacity to live in society.
1|
1|Only Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had come to Petersburg that
1|summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an
1|opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Helene at a ball she
1|stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence,
1|said in her gruff voice: "So wives of living men have started marrying
1|again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been
1|forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all
1|the brothels," and with these words Marya Dmitrievna, turning up her
1|wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly
1|round, moved across the room.
1|
1|Though people were afraid of Marya Dmitrievna she was regarded in
1|Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only
1|noticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had
1|used, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.
1|
1|Prince Vasili, who of late very often forgot what he had said and
1|repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his
1|daughter whenever he chanced to see her:
1|
1|"Helene, I have a word to say to you," and he would lead her
1|aside, drawing her hand downward. "I have heard of certain projects
1|concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father's
1|heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much....
1|But, my dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to
1|say," and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek
1|against his daughter's and move away.
1|
1|Bilibin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,
1|and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
1|Helene always has--men friends who can never change into lovers--once
1|gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.
1|
1|"Listen, Bilibin," said Helene (she always called friends of that
1|sort by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her
1|white, beringed fingers. "Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought
1|to do. Which of the two?"
1|
1|Bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with
1|a smile on his lips.
1|
1|"You are not taking me unawares, you know," said he. "As a true
1|friend, I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see,
1|if you marry the prince"--he meant the younger man--and he crooked one
1|finger, "you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you
1|will displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of
1|connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last
1|days happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be
1|making a mesalliance by marrying you," and Bilibin smoothed out his
1|forehead.
1|
1|"That's a true friend!" said Helene beaming, and again touching
1|Bilibin's sleeve. "But I love them, you know, and don't want to
1|distress either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of
1|them both."
1|
1|Bilibin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he
1|could help in that difficulty.
1|
1|"Une maitresse-femme!* That's what is called putting things
1|squarely. She would like to be married to all three at the same time,"
1|thought he.
1|
1|
1|*A masterly woman.
1|
1|
1|"But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?" Bilibin
1|asked, his reputation being so well established that he did not fear
1|to ask so naive a question. "Will he agree?"
1|
1|"Oh, he loves me so!" said Helene, who for some reason imagined that
1|Pierre too loved her. "He will do anything for me."
1|
1|Bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.
1|
1|"Even divorce you?" said he.
1|
1|Helene laughed.
1|
1|Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
1|marriage was Helene's mother, Princess Kuragina. She was continually
1|tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned
1|a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to
1|the idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of
1|divorce and remarriage during a husband's lifetime, and the priest
1|told her that it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text
1|in the Gospel which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage
1|while the husband is alive.
1|
1|Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable,
1|she drove to her daughter's early one morning so as to find her alone.
1|
1|Having listened to her mother's objections, Helene smiled blandly
1|and ironically.
1|
1|"But it says plainly: 'Whosoever shall marry her that is
1|divorced...'" said the old princess.
1|
1|"Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de betises. Vous ne comprenez rein. Dans ma
1|position j'ai des devoirs,"* said Helene changing from Russian, in
1|which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite
1|clear, into French which suited it better.
1|
1|
1|*"Oh, Mamma, don't talk nonsense! You don't understand anything.
1|In my position I have obligations."
1|
1|
1|"But, my dear...."
1|
1|"Oh, Mamma, how is it you don't understand that the Holy Father, who
1|has the right to grant dispensations..."
1|
1|Just then the lady companion who lived with Helene came in to
1|announce that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.
1|
1|"Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse
1|contre lui, parce qu'il m'a manque parole."*
1|
1|
1|*"No, tell him I don't wish to see him, I am furious with him for
1|not keeping his word to me."
1|
1|
1|"Comtesse, a tout peche misericorde,"* said a fair-haired young
1|man with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.
1|
1|
1|*"Countess, there is mercy for every sin."
1|
1|
1|The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who
1|had entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter
1|and sidled out of the room.
1|
1|"Yes, she is right," thought the old princess, all her convictions
1|dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. "She is right, but how
1|is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so
1|simple," she thought as she got into her carriage.
1|
1|
1|By the beginning of August Helene's affairs were clearly defined and
1|she wrote a letter to her husband--who, as she imagined, loved her
1|very much--informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her
1|having embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all
1|the formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to
1|him by the bearer of the letter.
1|
1|
1|And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful
1|keeping--Your friend Helene.
1|
1|
1|This letter was brought to Pierre's house when he was on the field
1|of Borodino.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|Toward the end of the battle of Borodino, Pierre, having run down
1|from Raevski's battery a second time, made his way through a gully
1|to Knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station,
1|and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still
1|entangled in the crowds of soldiers.
1|
1|The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away
1|quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that
1|day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a
1|room in his own bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of
1|life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and
1|felt. But such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.
1|
1|Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along
1|which he was going, still on all sides there was what there had been
1|on the field of battle. There were still the same suffering,
1|exhausted, and sometimes strangely indifferent faces, the same
1|blood, the same soldiers' overcoats, the same sounds of firing
1|which, though distant now, still aroused terror, and besides this
1|there were the foul air and the dust.
1|
1|Having gone a couple of miles along the Mozhaysk road, Pierre sat
1|down by the roadside.
1|
1|Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay
1|leaning on his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved
1|past him in the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon
1|ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he
1|shuddered and sat up. He had no idea how long he had been there. In
1|the middle of the night three soldiers, having brought some
1|firewood, settled down near him and began lighting a fire.
1|
1|The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire
1|to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some
1|dried bread and put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy
1|viands mingled with the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed.
1|The three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves, taking no
1|notice of him.
1|
1|"And who may you be?" one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently
1|meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: "If you want to eat
1|we'll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest
1|man."
1|
1|"I, I..." said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social
1|position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
1|better understood by them. "By rights I am a militia officer, but my
1|men are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them."
1|
1|"There now!" said one of the soldiers.
1|
1|Another shook his head.
1|
1|"Would you like a little mash?" the first soldier asked, and
1|handed Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.
1|
1|Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called
1|the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any
1|food he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping
1|himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was
1|lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.
1|
1|"Where have you to go to? Tell us!" said one of them.
1|
1|"To Mozhaysk."
1|
1|"You're a gentleman, aren't you?"
1|
1|"Yes."
1|
1|"And what's your name?"
1|
1|"Peter Kirilych."
1|
1|"Well then, Peter Kirilych, come along with us, we'll take you
1|there."
1|
1|In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozhaysk.
1|
1|By the time they got near Mozhaysk and began ascending the steep
1|hill into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on
1|with the soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom
1|of the hill and that he had already passed it. He would not soon
1|have remembered this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he
1|not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to
1|look for him in the town and was returning to the inn. The groom
1|recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat.
1|
1|"Your excellency!" he said. "Why, we were beginning to despair!
1|How is it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?"
1|
1|"Oh, yes!" said Pierre.
1|
1|The soldiers stopped.
1|
1|"So you've found your folk?" said one of them. "Well, good-by, Peter
1|Kirilych--isn't it?"
1|
1|"Good-by, Peter Kirilych!" Pierre heard the other voices repeat.
1|
1|"Good-by!" he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.
1|
1|"I ought to give them something!" he thought, and felt in his
1|pocket. "No, better not!" said another, inner voice.
1|
1|There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.
1|Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all,
1|lay down in his carriage.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt
1|himself falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness
1|of reality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of
1|projectiles, groans and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a
1|feeling of horror and dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he
1|opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was
1|tranquil in the yard. Only someone's orderly passed through the
1|gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above
1|Pierre's head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement he had made in
1|sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse. The
1|whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable
1|yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear
1|starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.
1|
1|"Thank God, there is no more of that!" he thought, covering up his
1|head again. "Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I
1|yielded to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time,
1|to the end..." thought he.
1|
1|They, in Pierre's mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the
1|battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before
1|the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood
1|out clearly and sharply from everyone else.
1|
1|"To be a soldier, just a soldier!" thought Pierre as he fell asleep,
1|"to enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them
1|what they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden
1|of my outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could
1|have run away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been
1|sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with Dolokhov." And the
1|memory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged
1|Dolokhov flashed through Pierre's mind, and then he remembered his
1|benefactor at Torzhok. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the
1|lodge presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English
1|Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table.
1|"Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!" thought Pierre.
1|"Yes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I am that he
1|died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!" On one side of the
1|table sat Anatole, Dolokhov, Nesvitski, Denisov, and others like
1|them (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as
1|clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed
1|they), and he heard those people, Anatole and Dolokhov, shouting and
1|singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor
1|was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as
1|weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but
1|pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor
1|was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite
1|distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the
1|possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,
1|firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they
1|were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him.
1|Wishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at
1|that moment his legs grew cold and bare.
1|
1|He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his
1|cloak had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his
1|cloak Pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs,
1|posts, and yard, but now they were all bluish, lit up, and
1|glittering with frost or dew.
1|
1|"It is dawn," thought Pierre. "But that's not what I want. I want to
1|hear and understand my benefactor's words." Again he covered himself
1|up with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was
1|there. There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts
1|that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.
1|
1|Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that
1|someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of
1|that day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to
1|think and express his thoughts like that when awake.
1|
1|"To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man's
1|freedom to the law of God," the voice had said. "Simplicity is
1|submission to the will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they
1|are simple. They do not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but
1|the unspoken is golden. Man can be master of nothing while he fears
1|death, but he who does not fear it possesses all. If there were no
1|suffering, man would not know his limitations, would not know himself.
1|The hardest thing [Pierre went on thinking, or hearing, in his
1|dream] is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all. To
1|unite all?" he asked himself. "No, not to unite. Thoughts cannot be
1|united, but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need!
1|Yes, one must harness them, must harness them!" he repeated to himself
1|with inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone expressed
1|what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him.
1|
1|"Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness."
1|
1|"Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your
1|excellency!" some voice was repeating. "We must harness, it is time to
1|harness...."
1|
1|It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone
1|straight into Pierre's face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the
1|middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
1|while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with
1|repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage
1|seat. "No, I don't want that, I don't want to see and understand that.
1|I want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream.
1|One second more and I should have understood it all! But what am I
1|to do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?" and Pierre felt
1|with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the
1|dream had been destroyed.
1|
1|The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an
1|officer had come with news that the French were already near
1|Mozhaysk and that our men were leaving it.
1|
1|Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him,
1|went on foot through the town.
1|
1|The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind
1|them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses,
1|and the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts
1|that were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and
1|blows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which
1|had overtaken him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him
1|to Moscow. On the way Pierre was told of the death of his
1|brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|On the thirteenth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the
1|gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopchin's adjutant.
1|
1|"We have been looking for you everywhere," said the adjutant. "The
1|count wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at
1|once on a very important matter."
1|
1|Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow
1|commander in chief.
1|
1|Count Rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his
1|summer villa at Sokolniki. The anteroom and reception room of his
1|house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for
1|orders. Vasilchikov and Platov had already seen the count and
1|explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it
1|would have to be surrendered. Though this news was being concealed
1|from the inhabitants, the officials--the heads of the various
1|government departments--knew that Moscow would soon be in the
1|enemy's hands, just as Count Rostopchin himself knew it, and to escape
1|personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how
1|they were to deal with their various departments.
1|
1|As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army
1|came out of Rostopchin's private room.
1|
1|In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a
1|despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.
1|
1|While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched
1|the various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who
1|were there. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to
1|a group of men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they
1|continued their conversation.
1|
1|"If they're sent out and brought back again later on it will do no
1|harm, but as things are now one can't answer for anything."
1|
1|"But you see what he writes..." said another, pointing to a
1|printed sheet he held in his hand.
1|
1|"That's another matter. That's necessary for the people," said the
1|first.
1|
1|"What is it?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Oh, it's a fresh broadsheet."
1|
1|Pierre took it and began reading.
1|
1|
1|His Serene Highness has passed through Mozhaysk in order to join
1|up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong
1|position where the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty eight guns
1|with ammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene
1|Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is
1|even ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that
1|the law courts are closed; things have to be put in order, and we will
1|deal with villains in our own way! When the time comes I shall want
1|both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two
1|beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will
1|be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be
1|best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow
1|after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the
1|wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water
1|blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now:
1|one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both.
1|
1|
1|"But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the
1|town," said Pierre, "and that the position..."
1|
1|"Well, of course! That's what we were saying," replied the first
1|speaker.
1|
1|"And what does he mean by 'One of my eyes was sore but now I am on
1|the lookout with both'?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"The count had a sty," replied the adjutant smiling, "and was very
1|much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the
1|matter with him. By the by, Count," he added suddenly, addressing
1|Pierre with a smile, "we heard that you have family troubles and
1|that the countess, your wife..."
1|
1|"I have heard nothing," Pierre replied unconcernedly. "But what have
1|you heard?"
1|
1|"Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I
1|heard."
1|
1|"But what did you hear?"
1|
1|"Well, they say," continued the adjutant with the same smile,
1|"that the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect
1|it's nonsense...."
1|
1|"Possibly," remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. "And
1|who is that?" he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue
1|peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy
1|face.
1|
1|"He? That's a tradesman, that is to say, he's the restaurant keeper,
1|Vereshchagin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the
1|proclamation."
1|
1|"Oh, so that is Vereshchagin!" said Pierre, looking at the firm,
1|calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a
1|traitor.
1|
1|"That's not he himself, that's the father of the fellow who wrote
1|the proclamation," said the adjutant. "The young man is in prison
1|and I expect it will go hard with him."
1|
1|An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German
1|wearing a cross round his neck, approached the speaker.
1|
1|"It's a complicated story, you know," said the adjutant. "That
1|proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed
1|of it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivanovich
1|here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly
1|sixty-three hands. He asked one, 'From whom did you get it?' 'From
1|so-and-so.' He went to the next one. 'From whom did you get it?' and
1|so on till he reached Vereshchagin, a half educated tradesman, you
1|know, 'a pet of a trader,'" said the adjutant smiling. "They asked
1|him, 'Who gave it you?' And the point is that we knew whom he had it
1|from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently
1|they had come to some understanding. He replied: 'From no one; I
1|made it up myself.' They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck
1|to that: 'I made it up myself.' And so it was reported to the count,
1|who sent for the man. 'From whom did you get the proclamation?' 'I
1|wrote it myself.' Well, you know the count," said the adjutant
1|cheerfully, with a smile of pride, "he flared up dreadfully--and
1|just think of the fellow's audacity, lying, and obstinacy!"
1|
1| "And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharev? I
1|understand!" said Pierre.
1|
1|"Not at all," rejoined the adjutant in dismay. "Klyucharev had his
1|own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been
1|banished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. 'How could
1|you have written it yourself?' said he, and he took up the Hamburg
1|Gazette that was lying on the table. 'Here it is! You did not write it
1|yourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because
1|you don't even know French, you fool.' And what do you think? 'No,'
1|said he, 'I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.' 'If that's
1|so, you're a traitor and I'll have you tried, and you'll be hanged!
1|Say from whom you had it.' 'I have seen no papers, I made it up
1|myself.' And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched,
1|but the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to
1|hard labor, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him.
1|But he's a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman's
1|son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere
1|and imagines that the devil is no match for him. That's the sort of
1|fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge,
1|and you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a
1|scepter in one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon
1|home with him for a few days and what did he do? He found some
1|scoundrel of a painter..."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the
1|commander in chief.
1|
1|When he entered the private room Count Rostopchin, puckering his
1|face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was
1|saying something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went
1|out.
1|
1|"Ah, how do you do, great warrior?" said Rostopchin as soon as the
1|short man had left the room. "We have heard of your prowess. But
1|that's not the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to
1|the Masons?" he went on severely, as though there were something wrong
1|about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained
1|silent. "I am well informed, my friend, but I am aware that there
1|are Masons and I hope that you are not one of those who
1|on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin Russia."
1|
1|"Yes, I am a Mason," Pierre replied.
1|
1|"There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Speranski
1|and Magnitski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharev
1|has been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea
1|of building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple
1|of their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for
1|this and that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a
1|harmful person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your
1|carriage for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted
1|papers from him for safe custody. I like you and don't wish you any
1|harm and--as you are only half my age--I advise you, as a father
1|would, to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave
1|here as soon as possible."
1|
1|"But what did Klyucharev do wrong, Count?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"That is for me to know, but not for you to ask," shouted
1|Rostopchin.
1|
1|"If he is accused of circulating Napoleon's proclamation it is not
1|proved that he did so," said Pierre without looking at Rostopchin,
1|"and Vereshchagin..."
1|
1|"There we are!" Rostopchin shouted at Pierre louder than before,
1|frowning suddenly. "Vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who
1|will be punished as he deserves," said he with the vindictive heat
1|with which people speak when recalling an insult. "But I did not
1|summon you to discuss my actions, but to give you advice--or an
1|order if you prefer it. I beg you to leave the town and break off
1|all communication with such men as Klyucharev. And I will knock the
1|nonsense out of anybody"--but probably realizing that he was
1|shouting at Bezukhov who so far was not guilty of anything, he
1|added, taking Pierre's hand in a friendly manner, "We are on the eve
1|of a public disaster and I haven't time to be polite to everybody
1|who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon
1|cher, what are you doing personally?"
1|
1|"Why, nothing," answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing
1|the thoughtful expression of his face.
1|
1|The count frowned.
1|
1|"A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can,
1|that's all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by,
1|my dear fellow. Oh, by the by!" he shouted through the doorway after
1|Pierre, "is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches
1|of the holy fathers of the Society of Jesus?"
1|
1|Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchin's room more sullen and
1|angry than he had ever before shown himself.
1|
1|When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight
1|people had come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee,
1|the colonel of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various
1|petitioners. They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions
1|from him. Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of
1|these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these
1|people. When left alone at last he opened and read his wife's letter.
1|
1|"They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old
1|man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary...
1|the meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting
1|married... One must forget and understand..." And going to his bed
1|he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.
1|
1|When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that
1|a special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count
1|Rostopchin to know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving
1|the town.
1|
1|A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in
1|the drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to
1|see them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.
1|
1|From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of
1|Bezukhov's household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre
1|again or knew where he was.

1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|The Rostovs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,
1|till the eve of the enemy's entry into the city.
1|
1|After Petya had joined Obolenski's regiment of Cossacks and left for
1|Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was
1|seized with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war,
1|had both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or
1|both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her
1|acquaintances, struck her that summer for the first time with cruel
1|clearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to
1|join Petya, or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but
1|neither of these proved possible. Petya could not return unless his
1|regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on
1|active service. Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent
1|a word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed account
1|of his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not sleep at
1|night, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying
1|dead. After many consultations and conversations, the count at last
1|devised means to tranquillize her. He got Petya transferred from
1|Obolenski's regiment to Bezukhov's, which was in training near Moscow.
1|Though Petya would remain in the service, this transfer would give the
1|countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her
1|wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her Petya so as not to let
1|him go again, but always get him appointed to places where he could
1|not possibly take part in a battle. As long as Nicholas alone was in
1|danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than
1|all her other children and even reproached herself for it; but when
1|her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always
1|breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to
1|everybody, that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black eyes and fresh
1|rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show--when he was
1|thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere
1|about something and apparently finding pleasure in it--then his mother
1|thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other children.
1|The nearer the time came for Petya to return, the more uneasy grew the
1|countess. She began to think she would never live to see such
1|happiness. The presence of Sonya, of her beloved Natasha, or even of
1|her husband irritated her. "What do I want with them? I want no one
1|but Petya," she thought.
1|
1|At the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from
1|Nicholas. He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had been
1|sent to procure remounts, but that letter did not set the countess
1|at ease. Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more
1|anxious about Petya.
1|
1|Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs'
1|acquaintances had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to
1|persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible, she would
1|not hear of leaving before her treasure, her adored Petya, returned.
1|On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness
1|with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old
1|officer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him
1|under her wing, Petya guessed her designs, and instinctively fearing
1|that he might give way to emotion when with her--might "become
1|womanish" as he termed it to himself--he treated her coldly, avoided
1|her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to
1|Natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly
1|tenderness, almost lover-like.
1|
1|Owing to the count's customary carelessness nothing was ready for
1|their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were
1|to come from their Ryazan and Moscow estates to remove their household
1|belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.
1|
1|From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a
1|bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodino
1|were brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts
1|of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their
1|possessions out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopchin's
1|broadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the
1|strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some
1|said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the
1|contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches
1|and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had been
1|another battle after Borodino at which the French had been routed,
1|while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been
1|destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the
1|clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin
1|had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the
1|peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and
1|so on. But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of
1|Fili, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been
1|held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt,
1|though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned,
1|and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save
1|their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break
1|up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.
1|As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die
1|immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is
1|awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,
1|though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the
1|conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would
1|be completely upset.
1|
1|During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole
1|Rostov family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the
1|family, Count Ilya Rostov, continually drove about the city collecting
1|the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty
1|orders at home about the preparations for their departure.
1|
1|The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied
1|with everything, was constantly in pursuit of Petya who was always
1|running away from her, and was jealous of Natasha with whom he spent
1|all his time. Sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by
1|getting things packed. But of late Sonya had been particularly sad and
1|silent. Nicholas' letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had
1|elicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who
1|saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess
1|and Nicholas.
1|
1|"I was never pleased at Bolkonski's engagement to Natasha," said the
1|countess, "but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had
1|a presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!"
1|
1|Sonya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of
1|retrieving the Rostovs' affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman,
1|and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her.
1|But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on
1|herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of
1|their things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess
1|turned to her when they had any orders to give. Petya and Natasha on
1|the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a
1|nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long the house
1|resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their
1|spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there
1|was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their
1|hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and
1|laughter to them. Petya was in high spirits because having left home a
1|boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man,
1|because he was at home, because he had left Belaya Tserkov where there
1|was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow
1|where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because
1|Natasha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natasha
1|was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her
1|of the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was
1|also happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of
1|others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them
1|run freely--and Petya adored her. Above all, they were gay because
1|there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town
1|gates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping--going away
1|somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and
1|that is always exciting, especially to the young.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the
1|Rostovs' house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the
1|furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and
1|pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay,
1|wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house
1|serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet
1|floors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high
1|and already corded up, others still empty.
1|
1|The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants
1|who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another
1|in the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning.
1|The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil
1|and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress
1|on her head. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with
1|whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active
1|army. Sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass
1|and china. Natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room
1|with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing
1|fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress
1|(already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg
1|ball.
1|
1|Natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy,
1|and several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart
1|was not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything
1|except with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood
1|beside Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but
1|soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At
1|first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the
1|maids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be
1|packed, she found it dull.
1|
1|"Dunyasha, you pack! You will, won't you, dear?" And when Dunyasha
1|willingly promised to do it all for her, Natasha sat down on the
1|floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite
1|unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was
1|roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room
1|(which was theirs) and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going
1|to the back porch. Natasha got up and looked out of the window. An
1|enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the
1|street.
1|
1|The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,
1|postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.
1|
1|Natasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and
1|holding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.
1|
1|The former housekeeper, old Mavra Kuzminichna, had stepped out of
1|the crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of
1|bast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.
1|Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her
1|handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.
1|
1|"Then you have nobody in Moscow?" she was saying. "You would be more
1|comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the
1|family are leaving."
1|
1|"I don't know if it would be allowed," replied the officer in a weak
1|voice. "Here is our commanding officer... ask him," and he pointed
1|to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of
1|carts.
1|
1|Natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded
1|officer and at once went to meet the major.
1|
1|"May the wounded men stay in our house?" she asked.
1|
1|The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.
1|
1|"Which one do you want, Ma'am'selle?" said he, screwing up his
1|eyes and smiling.
1|
1|Natasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner
1|were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her
1|handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some
1|reflection--as if considering in how far the thing was possible--replied
1|in the affirmative.
1|
1|"Oh yes, why not? They may," he said.
1|
1|With a slight inclination of her head, Natasha stepped back
1|quickly to Mavra Kuzminichna, who stood talking compassionately to the
1|officer.
1|
1|"They may. He says they may!" whispered Natasha.
1|
1|The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostovs' yard,
1|and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
1|townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of
1|the houses in Povarskaya Street. Natasha was evidently pleased to be
1|dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life.
1|She and Mavra Kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as
1|possible into their yard.
1|
1|"Your Papa must be told, though," said Mavra Kuzminichna.
1|
1|"Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can
1|move into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house."
1|
1|"There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if
1|we put them into the wing, the men's room, or the nurse's room, we
1|must ask permission."
1|
1|"Well, I'll ask."
1|
1|Natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the
1|half-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell of
1|vinegar and Hoffman's drops.
1|
1|"Are you asleep, Mamma?"
1|
1|"Oh, what sleep-?" said the countess, waking up just as she was
1|dropping into a doze.
1|
1|"Mamma darling!" said Natasha, kneeling by her mother and bringing
1|her face close to her mother's, "I am sorry, forgive me, I'll never do
1|it again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna has sent me: they have
1|brought some wounded here--officers. Will you let them come? They have
1|nowhere to go. I knew you'd let them come!" she said quickly all in
1|one breath.
1|
1|"What officers? Whom have they brought? I don't understand
1|anything about it," said the countess.
1|
1|Natasha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.
1|
1|"I knew you'd give permission... so I'll tell them," and, having
1|kissed her mother, Natasha got up and went to the door.
1|
1|In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.
1|
1|"We've stayed too long!" said the count with involuntary vexation.
1|"The Club is closed and the police are leaving."
1|
1|"Papa, is it all right--I've invited some of the wounded into the
1|house?" said Natasha.
1|
1|"Of course it is," he answered absently. "That's not the point. I
1|beg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and
1|tomorrow we must go, go, go!...."
1|
1|And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the
1|servants.
1|
1|At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had
1|heard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and
1|that though Rostopchin's broadsheet had said that he would sound a
1|call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already
1|been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and
1|that there would be a big battle there.
1|
1|The countess looked with timid horror at her son's eager, excited
1|face as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his
1|not going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the
1|impending engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the
1|fatherland--something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which
1|there would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and
1|so, hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her
1|as their protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after
1|dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take
1|her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman's
1|involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm,
1|said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very
1|night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the
1|countess' fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
1|dealer's in Myasnitski Street. When returning by that street she had
1|been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the
1|shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
1|cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels
1|at the drink store, having received orders to do so.
1|
1|After dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with
1|enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their
1|departure. The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing
1|from the yard to the house and back again, shouting confused
1|instructions to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more.
1|Petya directed things in the yard. Sonya, owing to the count's
1|contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The
1|servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing.
1|Natasha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set
1|to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing
1|was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and
1|did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded
1|obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed
1|her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first
1|exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her
1|authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable
1|Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha
1|set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost
1|full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much
1|china standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from
1|the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to
1|fetch it.
1|
1|"Sonya, wait a bit--we'll pack everything into these," said Natasha.
1|
1|"You can't, Miss, we have tried to," said the butler's assistant.
1|
1|"No, wait a minute, please."
1|
1|And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
1|wrapped in paper.
1|
1|"The dishes must go in here among the carpets," said she.
1|
1|"Why, it's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three
1|cases," said the butler's assistant.
1|
1|"Oh, wait, please!" And Natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out
1|the things. "These aren't needed," said she, putting aside some plates
1|of Kiev ware. "These--yes, these must go among the carpets," she said,
1|referring to the Saxony china dishes.
1|
1|"Don't, Natasha! Leave it alone! We'll get it all packed," urged
1|Sonya reproachfully.
1|
1|"What a young lady she is!" remarked the major-domo.
1|
1|But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began
1|quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and
1|unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had
1|been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned
1|out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all
1|been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases.
1|Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A
1|few more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on
1|having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler's
1|assistant and Petya--whom she had drawn into the business of
1|packing--press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.
1|
1|"That's enough, Natasha," said Sonya. "I see you were right, but
1|just take out the top one."
1|
1|"I won't!" cried Natasha, with one hand holding back the hair that
1|hung over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down
1|the carpets. "Now press, Petya! Press, Vasilich, press hard!" she
1|cried.
1|
1|The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping her hands,
1|screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only
1|lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted
1|her completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that
1|Natasha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came
1|to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it
1|might be corded up. Thanks to Natasha's directions the work now went
1|on expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most
1|valuable packed as compactly as possible.
1|
1|But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could
1|not get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the
1|count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.
1|
1|Sonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing.
1|
1|That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, and
1|Mavra Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought
1|into the Rostovs' yard. Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was a very
1|important man. He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised
1|hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the
1|driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers
1|followed the carriage in a cart.
1|
1|"Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house
1|will be empty," said the old woman to the old attendant.
1|
1|"Well, perhaps," said he with a sigh. "We don't expect to get him
1|home alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it's a long
1|way from here, and there's nobody living in it."
1|
1|"Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty of everything in the
1|master's house. Come in," said Mavra Kuzminichna. "Is he very ill?"
1|she asked.
1|
1|The attendant made a hopeless gesture.
1|
1|"We don't expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor."
1|
1|And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.
1|
1|"All right!" said the doctor.
1|
1|The old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook his
1|head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and
1|stopped beside Mavra Kuzminichna.
1|
1|"O, Lord Jesus Christ!" she murmured.
1|
1|She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.
1|
1|"The masters won't object..." she said.
1|
1|But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took
1|him into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame
1|Schoss'.
1|
1|This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|Moscow's last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a
1|Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just
1|as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the
1|city.
1|
1|Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow--the
1|rabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An
1|enormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with
1|whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone
1|early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for
1|Rostopchin who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow
1|would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the
1|public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state
1|of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept
1|rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling,
1|so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable
1|goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they
1|carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each,
1|and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.
1|
1|In the Rostovs' staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of
1|former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs
1|the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue
1|disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the
1|value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come
1|in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be
1|extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for
1|them. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on
1|the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of
1|September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the
1|Rostovs' and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rostovs'
1|and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating
1|the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo
1|to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the
1|wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention
1|the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was
1|evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to
1|refuse another, or all the carts and one's own carriages as well.
1|Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general
1|catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one's own family. So
1|thought the major-domo on his master's behalf.
1|
1|On waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom softly,
1|so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward
1|morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In
1|the yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front
1|porch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly
1|and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count
1|the major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go
1|away.
1|
1|"Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?" asked the count, and stroking
1|his bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the
1|orderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)
1|
1|"We can harness at once, your excellency."
1|
1|"Well, that's right. As soon as the countess wakes we'll be off, God
1|willing! What is it, gentlemen?" he added, turning to the officer.
1|"Are you staying in my house?"
1|
1|The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.
1|
1|"Count, be so good as to allow me... for God's sake, to get into
1|some corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I
1|shall be all right on a loaded cart..."
1|
1|Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
1|request on behalf of his master.
1|
1|"Oh, yes, yes, yes!" said the count hastily. "I shall be very
1|pleased, very pleased. Vasilich, you'll see to it. Just unload one
1|or two carts. Well, what of it... do what's necessary..." said the
1|count, muttering some indefinite order.
1|
1|But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the
1|officer's face had already sealed the order. The count looked around
1|him. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded
1|officers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at
1|the count and moving toward the porch.
1|
1|"Please step into the gallery, your excellency," said the
1|major-domo. "What are your orders about the pictures?"
1|
1|The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to
1|refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.
1|
1|"Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded," he added
1|in a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.
1|
1|At nine o'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, who
1|had been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed a
1|sort of chief gendarme's duty for her, came to say that Madame
1|Schoss was much offended and the young ladies' summer dresses could
1|not be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame
1|Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its
1|cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken
1|out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the
1|simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them.
1|The countess sent for her husband.
1|
1|"What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded."
1|
1|"You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer
1|came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are
1|things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
1|them!... Really now, in our own yard--we asked them in ourselves and
1|there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let
1|them be taken... where's the hurry?"
1|
1|The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money
1|matters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of
1|news of something detrimental to the children's interests, such as the
1|building of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a
1|private theater or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose
1|anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do
1|so.
1|
1|She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:
1|"Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting
1|nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our--all the
1|children's property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand
1|rubles' worth of things in the house. I don't consent, my dear, I
1|don't! Do as you please! It's the government's business to look after
1|the wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhins opposite, they
1|cleared out everything two days ago. That's what other people do. It's
1|only we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for
1|the children."
1|
1|Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
1|replying.
1|
1|"Papa, what are you doing that for?" asked Natasha, who had followed
1|him into her mother's room.
1|
1|"Nothing! What business is it of yours?" muttered the count angrily.
1|
1|"But I heard," said Natasha. "Why does Mamma object?"
1|
1|"What business is it of yours?" cried the count.
1|
1|Natasha stepped up to the window and pondered.
1|
1|"Papa! Here's Berg coming to see us," said she, looking out of the
1|window.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Berg, the Rostovs' son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the
1|orders of Vladimir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and
1|agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the
1|assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army.
1|
1|On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.
1|
1|He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone
1|in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something
1|to do there. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence
1|for family and domestic reasons.
1|
1|Berg drove up to his father-in-law's house in his spruce little trap
1|with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He
1|looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to
1|the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.
1|
1|From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into
1|the drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of
1|Natasha and Sonya, and hastened to inquire after "Mamma's" health.
1|
1|"Health, at a time like this?" said the count. "Come, tell us the
1|news! Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?"
1|
1|"God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,"
1|said Berg. "The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the
1|leaders, so to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what
1|is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic
1|spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they--which
1|it" (he corrected himself) "has shown or displayed in the battle of
1|the twenty-sixth--there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell
1|you, Papa" (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard
1|speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have
1|struck his breast at the words "Russian army"), "I tell you frankly
1|that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or
1|anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes,
1|those exploits of antique valor," he went on rapidly. "General Barclay
1|de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can
1|assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!"
1|
1|And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he
1|had heard those days. Natasha watched him with an intent gaze that
1|confused him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer
1|to some question.
1|
1|"Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors
1|cannot be imagined or adequately praised!" said Berg, glancing round
1|at Natasha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her
1|intent look with a smile. "'Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in
1|the hearts of her sons!' Isn't it so, Papa?" said he.
1|
1|Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary
1|and dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her
1|hand, asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to
1|side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.
1|
1|"Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad
1|times for every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still
1|time to get away...."
1|
1|"I can't think what the servants are about," said the countess,
1|turning to her husband. "I have just been told that nothing is ready
1|yet. Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mitenka at such
1|times. There won't be any end to it."
1|
1|The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained
1|himself. He got up from his chair and went to the door.
1|
1|At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
1|and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and
1|significantly.
1|
1|"And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa," said he.
1|
1|"Hm..." said the count, and stopped.
1|
1|"I was driving past Yusupov's house just now," said Berg with a
1|laugh, "when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I
1|wouldn't buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and
1|there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear
1|Vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it."
1|(At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg
1|involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable
1|domestic arrangements.) "And it's such a beauty! It pulls out and
1|has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear Vera has long wanted
1|one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so many of those
1|peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will pay the man
1|well, and..."
1|
1|The count frowned and coughed.
1|
1|"Ask the countess, I don't give orders."
1|
1|"If it's inconvenient, please don't," said Berg. "Only I so wanted
1|it, for dear Vera's sake."
1|
1|"Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the
1|devil..." cried the old count. "My head's in a whirl!"
1|
1|And he left the room. The countess began to cry.
1|
1|"Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!" said Berg.
1|
1|Natasha left the room with her father and, as if finding it
1|difficult to reach some decision, first followed him and then ran
1|downstairs.
1|
1|Petya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the
1|servants who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still
1|standing in the yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded
1|officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly.
1|
1|"Do you know what it's about?" Petya asked Natasha.
1|
1|She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling
1|about. She did not answer.
1|
1|"It's because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the
1|wounded," said Petya. "Vasilich told me. I consider..."
1|
1|"I consider," Natasha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry
1|face to Petya, "I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I
1|don't know what. Are we despicable Germans?"
1|
1|Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening
1|and letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed
1|headlong up the stairs.
1|
1|Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the
1|respectful attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was
1|pacing up and down the room, when Natasha, her face distorted by
1|anger, burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid
1|steps.
1|
1|"It's horrid! It's abominable!" she screamed. "You can't possibly
1|have ordered it!"
1|
1|Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The
1|count stood still at the window and listened.
1|
1|"Mamma, it's impossible: see what is going on in the yard!" she
1|cried. "They will be left!..."
1|
1|"What's the matter with you? Who are 'they'? What do you want?"
1|
1|"Why, the wounded! It's impossible, Mamma. It's monstrous!... No,
1|Mamma darling, it's not the thing. Please forgive me, darling....
1|Mamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is
1|going on in the yard... Mamma!... It's impossible!"
1|
1|The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.
1|Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.
1|
1|The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for
1|her mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did
1|not turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.
1|
1|"Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?" she said, not
1|surrendering at once.
1|
1|"Mamma, darling, forgive me!"
1|
1|But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her
1|husband.
1|
1|"My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don't understand
1|about it," said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.
1|
1|"The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen," muttered the count
1|through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide
1|her look of shame on his breast.
1|
1|"Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?..." asked Natasha. "We will
1|still take all the most necessary things."
1|
1|The count nodded affirmatively, and Natasha, at the rapid pace at
1|which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to
1|the anteroom and downstairs into the yard.
1|
1|The servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the
1|strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his
1|wife's name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the
1|wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood
1|that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and
1|zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it
1|seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour
1|before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should
1|be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the
1|only thing to do.
1|
1|The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner,
1|set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the
1|carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood
1|with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to
1|be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men
1|began to come into the Rostovs' yard. Many of the wounded asked them
1|not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the
1|things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be
1|arrested. It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the
1|things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and
1|mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay
1|about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding
1|possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have
1|another and yet another cart.
1|
1|"We can take four more men," said the steward. "They can have my
1|trap, or else what is to become of them?"
1|
1|"Let them have my wardrobe cart," said the countess. "Dunyasha can
1|go with me in the carriage."
1|
1|They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from
1|a house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was
1|bright and animated. Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement
1|such as she had not known for a long time.
1|
1|"What could we fasten this onto?" asked the servants, trying to
1|fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. "We must keep
1|at least one cart."
1|
1|"What's in it?" asked Natasha.
1|
1|"The count's books."
1|
1|"Leave it, Vasilich will put it away. It's not wanted."
1|
1|The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where
1|Count Peter could sit.
1|
1|"On the box. You'll sit on the box, won't you, Petya?" cried
1|Natasha.
1|
1|Sonya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was
1|quite different from Natasha's. She was putting away the things that
1|had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess
1|wished, and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages,
1|packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door.
1|One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.
1|
1|The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sonya's
1|attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she
1|was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that
1|stood at the entrance.
1|
1|"Whose caleche is that?" she inquired, leaning out of the carriage
1|window.
1|
1|"Why, didn't you know, Miss?" replied the maid. "The wounded prince:
1|he spent the night in our house and is going with us."
1|
1|"But who is it? What's his name?"
1|
1|"It's our intended that was--Prince Bolkonski himself! They say he
1|is dying," replied the maid with a sigh.
1|
1|Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,
1|tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was
1|pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to
1|assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before
1|starting. Natasha was not in the room.
1|
1|"Mamma," said Sonya, "Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is
1|going with us."
1|
1|The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's arm,
1|glanced around.
1|
1|"Natasha?" she murmured.
1|
1|At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.
1|They knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen if she
1|heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.
1|
1|"Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us," said Sonya.
1|
1|"You say he is dying?"
1|
1|Sonya nodded.
1|
1|The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.
1|
1|"The ways of God are past finding out!" she thought, feeling that
1|the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all
1|that was now taking place.
1|
1|"Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's the matter?" asked
1|Natasha, as with animated face she ran into the room.
1|
1|"Nothing," answered the countess. "If everything is ready let us
1|start."
1|
1|And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face.
1|Sonya embraced Natasha and kissed her.
1|
1|Natasha looked at her inquiringly.
1|
1|"What is it? What has happened?"
1|
1|"Nothing... No..."
1|
1|"Is it something very bad for me? What is it?" persisted Natasha
1|with her quick intuition.
1|
1|Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss,
1|Mavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having
1|closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments
1|silently seated without looking at one another.
1|
1|The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed
1|himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count
1|embraced Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow,
1|and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted
1|their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting
1|words. The countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on
1|her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging
1|on the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition
1|was connected, were being taken with them.)
1|
1|In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with
1|swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and
1|with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining
1|behind.
1|
1|As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put
1|in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on
1|each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help
1|the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the
1|house to the carriages, the caleche, the phaeton, and back again.
1|
1|"They always will forget everything!" said the countess. "Don't
1|you know I can't sit like that?"
1|
1|And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an
1|aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange
1|the seat.
1|
1|"Oh, those servants!" said the count, swaying his head.
1|
1|Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to
1|drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as
1|glance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years'
1|experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, "Be
1|off, in God's name!" would be given him: and he knew that even when it
1|was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back
1|to fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he
1|would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of
1|the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully
1|down the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what
1|would happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the
1|near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and
1|champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were
1|folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a
1|traveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to
1|say. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself.
1|The postilion and all the other servants did the same. "Off, in
1|God's name!" said Efim, putting on his hat. "Start!" The postilion
1|started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the
1|high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman
1|sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed
1|out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted
1|in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In
1|the carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as
1|they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in
1|Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.
1|
1|Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting
1|in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly
1|receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned
1|out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the
1|long train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line
1|she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew's caleche. She did
1|not know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her
1|eyes sought that caleche. She knew it was right in front.
1|
1|In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets
1|came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs', and
1|as they passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts
1|formed two rows abreast.
1|
1|As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was
1|inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
1|past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:
1|
1|"Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!"
1|
1|"Who? Who?"
1|
1|"Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!" said Natasha, putting her
1|head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a
1|coachman's long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was
1|evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the
1|arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced,
1|beardless old man in a frieze coat.
1|
1|"Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with a
1|queer-looking old boy. Really," said Natasha, "look, look!"
1|
1|"No, it's not he. How can you talk such nonsense?"
1|
1|"Mamma," screamed Natasha, "I'll stake my head it's he! I assure
1|you! Stop, stop!" she cried to the coachman.
1|
1|But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street
1|came more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at
1|to move on and not block the way.
1|
1|In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the
1|Rostovs all saw Pierre--or someone extraordinarily like him--in a
1|coachman's coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious
1|face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That
1|old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at
1|them, and respectfully touching Pierre's elbow said something to him
1|and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought,
1|could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood
1|and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized
1|Natasha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly
1|toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember
1|something and stopped.
1|
1|Natasha's face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical
1|kindliness.
1|
1|"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is
1|wonderful!" she cried, holding out her hand to him. "What are you
1|doing? Why are you like this?"
1|
1|Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he
1|walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.
1|
1|"What is the matter, Count?" asked the countess in a surprised and
1|commiserating tone.
1|
1|"What? What? Why? Don't ask me," said Pierre, and looked round at
1|Natasha whose radiant, happy expression--of which he was conscious
1|without looking at her--filled him with enchantment.
1|
1|"Are you remaining in Moscow, then?"
1|
1|Pierre hesitated.
1|
1|"In Moscow?" he said in a questioning tone. "Yes, in Moscow.
1|Good-by!"
1|
1|"Ah, if only I were a man? I'd certainly stay with you. How
1|splendid!" said Natasha. "Mamma, if you'll let me, I'll stay!"
1|
1|Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something,
1|but the countess interrupted him.
1|
1|"You were at the battle, we heard."
1|
1|"Yes, I was," Pierre answered. "There will be another battle
1|tomorrow..." he began, but Natasha interrupted him.
1|
1|"But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like
1|yourself...."
1|
1|"Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! I don't know myself. Tomorrow...
1|But no! Good-by, good-by!" he muttered. "It's an awful time!" and
1|dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.
1|
1|Natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming
1|at him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.
1|
1|

1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been
1|living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdeev. This is
1|how it happened.
1|
1|When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his
1|interview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some time make out
1|where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that
1|among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a
1|Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Helene,
1|he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and
1|hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything
1|was now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces,
1|that nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was
1|no escape from this position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to
1|himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then
1|rose, went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the
1|crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a book. His
1|major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had
1|brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if
1|only for a minute, and that someone from Bazdeev's widow had called to
1|ask Pierre to take charge of her husband's books, as she herself was
1|leaving for the country.
1|
1|"Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say
1|I will come directly," Pierre replied to the major-domo.
1|
1|But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat
1|which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other
1|door. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole
1|length of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his
1|forehead with both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The
1|hall porter was standing at the front door. From the landing where
1|Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back
1|entrance. He went down that staircase and out into the yard. No one
1|had seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as soon as
1|Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter
1|noticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being
1|looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in
1|order not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went
1|down the street.
1|
1|Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph
1|Bazdeev's books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.
1|
1|He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
1|Patriarch's Ponds, where the widow Bazdeev's house was.
1|
1|Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that
1|were making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing
1|his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle,
1|Pierre, experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school,
1|began to talk to his driver.
1|
1|The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the
1|Kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the
1|Three Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there.
1|
1|Having reached the Patriarch's Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs'
1|house, where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the
1|gate. Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at
1|Torzhok five years before with Joseph Bazdeev, came out in answer to
1|his knock.
1|
1|"At home?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danilovna has gone to
1|the Torzhok estate with the children, your excellency."
1|
1|"I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,"
1|said Pierre.
1|
1|"Be so good as to step in. Makar Alexeevich, the brother of my
1|late master--may the kingdom of heaven be his--has remained here,
1|but he is in a weak state as you know," said the old servant.
1|
1|Pierre knew that Makar Alexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev's half-insane
1|brother and a hard drinker.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in..." said Pierre and entered the
1|house.
1|
1|A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown
1|and with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing
1|Pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.
1|
1|"He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your
1|honor sees," said Gerasim. "Will you step into the study?" Pierre
1|nodded. "As it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia
1|Danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to
1|have the books."
1|
1|Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
1|trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime. The room, dusty and
1|untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier.
1|
1|Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe.
1|Pierre went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the
1|manuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most
1|important, the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic
1|Scotch Acts with Bazdeev's notes and explanations. He sat down at
1|the dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts before
1|him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and
1|resting his head on his hand sank into meditation.
1|
1|Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw
1|Pierre always sitting in the same attitude.
1|
1|More than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of making
1|a slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did
1|not hear him.
1|
1|"Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?"
1|
1|"Oh yes!" said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. "Look
1|here," he added, taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking
1|down at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, "I say, do
1|you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?"
1|
1|"We heard so," replied the man.
1|
1|"I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you."
1|
1|"Yes, your excellency," replied Gerasim. "Will you have something to
1|eat?"
1|
1|"No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a
1|pistol," said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.
1|
1|"Yes, your excellency," said Gerasim after thinking for a moment.
1|
1|All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor's
1|study, and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to
1|another and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made
1|up for him there.
1|
1|Gerasim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange
1|things, accepted Pierre's taking up his residence in the house without
1|surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same
1|evening--without even asking himself what they were wanted for--he
1|procured a coachman's coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him
1|the pistol next day. Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening
1|shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and
1|looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward
1|him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and
1|angry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the
1|coachman's coat which Gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected
1|by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the
1|Sukharev market that he met the Rostovs.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|Kutuzov's order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazan road was
1|issued at night on the first of September.
1|
1|The first troops started at once, and during the night they
1|marched slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those
1|nearing the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of
1|soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the
1|opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless
1|masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind, and an
1|unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. They all rushed forward
1|to the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and the boats. Kutuzov
1|himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow.
1|
1|By ten o'clock in the morning of the second of September, only the
1|rear guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb, where they had ample
1|room. The main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.
1|
1|At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,
1|Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny Hill looking at
1|the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to
1|the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodino to the
1|entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,
1|memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
1|always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
1|than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
1|atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and
1|refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights
1|are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and
1|delight us continually by falling from the sky.
1|
1|At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather
1|still held.
1|
1|The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the
1|Poklonny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens,
1|and her churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her
1|cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight.
1|
1|The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as
1|he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious
1|and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that
1|has no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full
1|force of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a
1|distance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the
1|Poklonny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as
1|it were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body.
1|
1|Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every
1|foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the
1|mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.
1|
1|"Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises, Moscou la sainte.
1|La voila done enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il etait temps,"* said he,
1|and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before
1|him, and summoned Lelorgne d'Ideville, the interpreter.
1|
1|
1|*"That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here
1|it is then at last, that famous city. It was high time."
1|
1|
1|"A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her
1|honor," thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at Smolensk). From
1|that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen
1|before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had
1|seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning
1|light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its
1|details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him.
1|
1|"But could it be otherwise?" he thought. "Here is this capital at my
1|feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,
1|beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In
1|what light must I appear to them!" thought he, thinking of his troops.
1|"Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men," he
1|reflected, glancing at those near him and at the troops who were
1|approaching and forming up. "One word from me, one movement of my
1|hand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But my
1|clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished. I must be
1|magnanimous and truly great. But no, it can't be true that I am in
1|Moscow," he suddenly thought. "Yet here she is lying at my feet,
1|with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the
1|sunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism
1|and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy....
1|It is just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know him."
1|(It seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what was taking
1|place lay in the personal struggle between himself and Alexander.)
1|"From the height of the Kremlin--yes, there is the Kremlin, yes--I
1|will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true
1|civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their
1|conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do
1|not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy
1|of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I
1|will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not
1|wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch.
1|'Boyars,' I will say to them, 'I do not desire war, I desire the peace
1|and welfare of all my subjects.' However, I know their presence will
1|inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly,
1|impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in
1|Moscow? Yes, there she lies."
1|
1|"Qu'on m'amene les boyars,"* said he to his suite.
1|
1|
1|*"Bring the boyars to me."
1|
1|
1|A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
1|boyars.
1|
1|Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
1|same place on the Poklonny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to
1|the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That
1|speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.
1|
1|He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended
1|to adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for
1|assemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and
1|his own would mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who
1|would win the hearts of the people. Having learned that there were
1|many charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he
1|would shower favors on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he
1|had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must
1|be beneficent like the Tsars. And in order finally to touch the hearts
1|of the Russians--and being like all Frenchmen unable to imagine
1|anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere, ma tendre, ma
1|pauvre mere* --he decided that he would place an inscription on all
1|these establishments in large letters: "This establishment is
1|dedicated to my dear mother." Or no, it should be simply: Maison de ma
1|Mere,*[2] he concluded. "But am I really in Moscow? Yes, here it
1|lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in
1|appearing?" he wondered.
1|
1|
1|*"My dear, my tender, my poor mother."
1|
1|*[2] "House of my Mother."
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in
1|whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite.
1|Those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that
1|Moscow was empty, that everyone had left it. The faces of those who
1|were not conferring together were pale and perturbed. They were not
1|alarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned by its
1|inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the question how to
1|tell the Emperor--without putting him in the terrible position of
1|appearing ridiculous--that he had been awaiting the boyars so long
1|in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no one
1|else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped
1|together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor
1|should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the
1|truth.
1|
1|"He will have to be told, all the same," said some gentlemen of
1|the suite. "But, gentlemen..."
1|
1|The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating
1|upon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before
1|the outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from
1|under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.
1|
1|"But it's impossible..." declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging
1|their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word--le
1|ridicule...
1|
1|At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor's
1|instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too
1|long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with
1|his hand. A single report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops,
1|who were already spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into
1|the city through Tver, Kaluga, and Dorogomilov gates. Faster and
1|faster, vying with one another, they moved at the double or at a trot,
1|vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air
1|ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts.
1|
1|Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as
1|far as the Dorogomilov gate, but there again stopped and,
1|dismounting from his horse, paced for a long time by the
1|Kammer-Kollezski rampart, awaiting the deputation.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a
1|fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was
1|empty. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.
1|
1|In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance
1|it seems as much alive as other hives.
1|
1|The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday
1|sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of
1|honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But
1|one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer
1|any life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the
1|sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper's tap
1|on the wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous
1|humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly
1|compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an
1|aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from
1|different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board,
1|instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom,
1|and the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and
1|decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels
1|sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in
1|defense of the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of
1|throbbing activity, like the sound of boiling water, but diverse
1|discordant sounds of disorder. In and out of the hive long black
1|robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not
1|sting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey
1|flew into the hive, and they flew out empty; now they fly out laden.
1|The beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in. Instead
1|of black, glossy bees--tamed by toil, clinging to one another's legs
1|and drawing out the wax, with a ceaseless hum of labor--that used to
1|hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled
1|bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and
1|walls of the hive. Instead of a neatly glued floor, swept by the bees
1|with the fanning of their wings, there is a floor littered with bits
1|of wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving their legs, and dead
1|ones that have not been cleared away.
1|
1|The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the
1|super. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the
1|combs and keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex
1|structures of the combs, but no longer in their former state of
1|purity. All is neglected and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and
1|stealthily prowling about the combs, and the short home bees,
1|shriveled and listless as if they were old, creep slowly about without
1|trying to hinder the robbers, having lost all motive and all sense
1|of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and butterflies knock awkwardly
1|against the walls of the hive in their flight. Here and there among
1|the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can
1|sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of bees, by force of habit
1|and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with efforts beyond their
1|strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing
1|why they do it. In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting,
1|or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, without themselves
1|knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third
1|place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack some victim and
1|fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops
1|from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses.
1|The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells.
1|In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of
1|bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation,
1|he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They
1|have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had
1|guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only a
1|few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the
1|enemy's hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are
1|dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the
1|hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears out its contents
1|and burns it clean.
1|
1|So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy,
1|and morose, paced up and down in front of the Kammer-Kollezski
1|rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal,
1|observance of the proprieties--a deputation.
1|
1|In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people
1|aimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of
1|what they were doing.
1|
1|When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was
1|empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently
1|continued to walk to and fro.
1|
1|"My carriage!" he said.
1|
1|He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into
1|the suburb. "Moscow deserted!" he said to himself. "What an incredible
1|event!"
1|
1|He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the
1|Dorogomilov suburb.
1|
1|The coup de theatre had not come off.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXI
1|
1|
1|The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o'clock at
1|night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded
1|and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving.
1|
1|The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at
1|the Stone, Moskva, and Yauza bridges.
1|
1|While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the
1|Kremlin, were thronging the Moskva and the Stone bridges, a great many
1|soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back
1|from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church
1|of Vasili the Beatified and under the Borovitski gate, back up the
1|hill to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily
1|take things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap
1|sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were
1|no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers
1|to enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of
1|female purchasers--but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though
1|without muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently
1|making their way out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen
1|and their assistants (of whom there were but few) moved about among
1|the soldiers quite bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked
1|them up again, and themselves carried goods away with the help of their
1|assistants. On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating
1|the muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting
1|soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made
1|them, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in the
1|shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with
1|closely shaven heads. Two officers, one with a scarf over his
1|uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an
1|overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka Street,
1|talking. A third officer galloped up to them.
1|
1|"The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.
1|This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed."
1|
1|"Where are you off to?... Where?..." he shouted to three infantrymen
1|without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were
1|slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. "Stop, you rascals!"
1|
1|"But how are you going to stop them?" replied another officer.
1|"There is no getting them together. The army should push on before the
1|rest bolt, that's all!"
1|
1|"How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge,
1|and don't move. Shouldn't we put a cordon round to prevent the rest
1|from running away?"
1|
1|"Come, go in there and drive them out!" shouted the senior officer.
1|
1|The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went
1|with him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a
1|group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose,
1|and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face,
1|hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his
1|arms.
1|
1|"Your honor!" said he. "Be so good as to protect us! We won't grudge
1|trifles, you are welcome to anything--we shall be delighted!
1|Pray!... I'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable
1|gentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is;
1|but what's all this--sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be
1|placed if only to let us close the shop...."
1|
1|Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.
1|
1|"Eh, what twaddle!" said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man.
1|"When one's head is gone one doesn't weep for one's hair! Take what
1|any of you like!" And flourishing his arm energetically he turned
1|sideways to the officer.
1|
1|"It's all very well for you, Ivan Sidorych, to talk," said the first
1|tradesman angrily. "Please step inside, your honor!"
1|
1|"Talk indeed!" cried the thin one. "In my three shops here I have
1|a hundred thousand rubles' worth of goods. Can they be saved when
1|the army has gone? Eh, what people! 'Against God's might our hands
1|can't fight.'"
1|
1|"Come inside, your honor!" repeated the tradesman, bowing.
1|
1|The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.
1|
1|"It's not my business!" he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one
1|of the passages.
1|
1|From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and
1|just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven
1|head was flung out violently.
1|
1|This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer.
1|The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that
1|moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the
1|Moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square.
1|
1|"What is it? What is it?" he asked, but his comrade was already
1|galloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction from which
1|the screams came.
1|
1|The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached
1|the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the
1|bridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces
1|among the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two
1|horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close
1|to the wheels. The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a
1|child's chair with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering
1|piercing and desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers
1|that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to
1|the fact that General Ermolov, coming up to the crowd and learning
1|that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of
1|civilians blocked the bridge, had ordered two guns to be unlimbered
1|and made a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd, crushing one
1|another, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately,
1|had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXII
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone
1|in the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and
1|there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be
1|heard. Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely
1|heard. The Povarskaya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard
1|of the Rostovs' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung
1|from the horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great
1|drawing room of the house, which had been left with all it
1|contained, were two people. They were the yard porter Ignat, and the
1|page boy Mishka, Vasilich's grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his
1|grandfather. Mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on
1|it with one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling
1|with satisfaction before the large mirror.
1|
1|"Isn't it fine, eh, Uncle Ignat?" said the boy, suddenly beginning
1|to strike the keyboard with both hands.
1|
1|"Only fancy!" answered Ignat, surprised at the broadening grin on
1|his face in the mirror.
1|
1|"Impudence! Impudence!" they heard behind them the voice of Mavra
1|Kuzminichna who had entered silently. "How he's grinning, the fat mug!
1|Is that what you're here for? Nothing's cleared away down there and
1|Vasilich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!"
1|
1|Ignat left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the
1|room with meekly downcast eyes.
1|
1|"Aunt, I did it gently," said the boy.
1|
1|"I'll give you something gently, you monkey you!" cried Mavra
1|Kuzminichna, raising her arm threateningly. "Go and get the samovar to
1|boil for your grandfather."
1|
1|Mavra Kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it,
1|and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.
1|
1|Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
1|next--to drink tea in the servants' wing with Vasilich, or into the
1|storeroom to put away what still lay about.
1|
1|She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street.
1|Someone stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to
1|open it. Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate.
1|
1|"Who do you want?"
1|
1|"The count--Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov."
1|
1|"And who are you?"
1|
1|"An officer, I have to see him," came the reply in a pleasant,
1|well-bred Russian voice.
1|
1|Mavra Kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with
1|the round face of a Rostov, entered the yard.
1|
1|"They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,"
1|said Mavra Kuzminichna cordially.
1|
1|The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating
1|whether to enter or not, clicked his tongue.
1|
1|"Ah, how annoying!" he muttered. "I should have come yesterday....
1|Ah, what a pity."
1|
1|Meanwhile, Mavra Kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically
1|examining the familiar Rostov features of the young man's face, his
1|tattered coat and trodden-down boots.
1|
1|"What did you want to see the count for?" she asked.
1|
1|"Oh well... it can't be helped!" said he in a tone of vexation and
1|placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.
1|
1|He again paused in indecision.
1|
1|"You see," he suddenly said, "I am a kinsman of the count's and he
1|has been very kind to me. As you see" (he glanced with an amused air
1|and good-natured smile at his coat and boots) "my things are worn
1|out and I have no money, so I was going to ask the count..."
1|
1|Mavra Kuzminichna did not let him finish.
1|
1|"Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment," said she.
1|
1|And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,
1|hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the
1|servants' quarters.
1|
1|While Mavra Kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked
1|about the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a
1|faint smile on his lips. "What a pity I've missed Uncle! What a nice
1|old woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the
1|nearest way to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near
1|the Rogozhski gate?" thought he. Just then Mavra Kuzminichna
1|appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet
1|resolute look, carrying a rolled-up check kerchief in her hand.
1|While still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and
1|took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed
1|it to him.
1|
1|"If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of
1|course... but as it is..."
1|
1|Mavra Kuzminichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not
1|decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.
1|
1|"If the count had been at home..." Mavra Kuzminichna went on
1|apologetically. "Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!"
1|said she, bowing as she saw him out.
1|
1|Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer
1|ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yauza
1|bridge to overtake his regiment.
1|
1|But Mavra Kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with
1|moist eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected
1|flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIII
1|
1|
1|From an unfinished house on the Varvarka, the ground floor of
1|which was a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches
1|round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands.
1|Tipsy and perspiring, with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were
1|all laboriously singing some song or other. They were singing
1|discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not
1|because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were
1|drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue
1|coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight
1|nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin,
1|compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently
1|possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and
1|solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with
1|the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out
1|his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he
1|always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it
1|were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing
1|should be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and
1|fighting and blows in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his
1|arm.
1|
1|"Stop it!" he exclaimed peremptorily. "There's a fight, lads!"
1|And, still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.
1|
1|The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the
1|leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning,
1|had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this
1|had had drink served them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring
1|smithy, hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it
1|to have been broken into, wished to force their way in too and a fight
1|in the porch had resulted.
1|
1|The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when
1|the workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern
1|keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.
1|
1|Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the
1|publican with his chest.
1|
1|The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the
1|face and cried wildly: "They're fighting us, lads!"
1|
1|At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised
1|face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: "Police! Murder!...
1|They've killed a man, lads!"
1|
1|"Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death--killed!..." screamed a
1|woman coming out of a gate close by.
1|
1|A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.
1|
1|"Haven't you robbed people enough--taking their last shirts?" said a
1|voice addressing the publican. "What have you killed a man for, you
1|thief?"
1|
1|The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from
1|the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he
1|ought to fight now.
1|
1|"Murderer!" he shouted suddenly to the publican. "Bind him, lads!"
1|
1|"I daresay you would like to bind me!" shouted the publican, pushing
1|away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head
1|he flung it on the ground.
1|
1|As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the
1|workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.
1|
1|"I know the law very well, mates! I'll take the matter to the
1|captain of police. You think I won't get to him? Robbery is not
1|permitted to anybody now a days!" shouted the publican, picking up his
1|cap.
1|
1|"Come along then! Come along then!" the publican and the tall
1|young fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the
1|street together.
1|
1|The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and
1|others followed behind, talking and shouting.
1|
1|At the corner of the Moroseyka, opposite a large house with closed
1|shutters and bearing a bootmaker's signboard, stood a score of thin,
1|worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long
1|tattered coats.
1|
1|"He should pay folks off properly," a thin workingman, with frowning
1|brows and a straggly beard, was saying.
1|
1|"But he's sucked our blood and now he thinks he's quit of us. He's
1|been misleading us all the week and now that he's brought us to this
1|pass he's made off."
1|
1|On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
1|speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the
1|moving crowd.
1|
1|"Where are all the folks going?"
1|
1|"Why, to the police, of course!"
1|
1|"I say, is it true that we have been beaten?" "And what did you
1|think? Look what folks are saying."
1|
1|Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage
1|of the increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.
1|
1|The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his
1|bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention
1|to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded,
1|expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their
1|minds.
1|
1|"He must keep order, keep the law, that's what the government is
1|there for. Am I not right, good Christians?" said the tall youth, with
1|a scarcely perceptible smile. "He thinks there's no government! How
1|can one do without government? Or else there would be plenty who'd rob
1|us."
1|
1|"Why talk nonsense?" rejoined voices in the crowd. "Will they give
1|up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed
1|it! Aren't there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed!
1|That's what the government is for. You'd better listen to what
1|people are saying," said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.
1|
1|By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered
1|round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.
1|
1|"An ukase, they are reading an ukase! Reading an ukase!" cried
1|voices in the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.
1|
1|The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31
1|When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the
1|demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a
1|rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.
1|
1|"Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness," he read
1|("Sirin Highness," said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his
1|lips and a frown on his brow), "to consult with him to act, and to aid
1|the army to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part..."
1|the reader went on, and then paused ("Do you see," shouted the youth
1|victoriously, "he's going to clear up the whole affair for
1|you...."), "in destroying them, and will send these visitors to the
1|devil. I will come back to dinner, and we'll set to work. We will
1|do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels."
1|
1|The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The
1|tall lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had
1|understood the last part. In particular, the words "I will come back
1|to dinner," evidently displeased both reader and audience. The
1|people's minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple
1|and needlessly comprehensible--it was what any one of them might
1|have said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest
1|authority should not say.
1|
1|They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his
1|lips and swayed from side to side.
1|
1|"We should ask him... that's he himself?"... "Yes, ask him
1|indeed!... Why not? He'll explain"... voices in the rear of the
1|crowd were suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned
1|to the police superintendent's trap which drove into the square
1|attended by two mounted dragoons.
1|
1|The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count
1|Rostopchin's orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
1|matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
1|pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
1|stop.
1|
1|"What people are these?" he shouted to the men, who were moving
1|singly and timidly in the direction of his trap.
1|
1|"What people are these?" he shouted again, receiving no answer.
1|
1|"Your honor..." replied the shopman in the frieze coat, "your honor,
1|in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count,
1|they desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any
1|kind of riot, but as his highest excellence said..."
1|
1|"The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued
1|concerning you," said the superintendent of police. "Go on!" he
1|ordered his coachman.
1|
1|The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the
1|superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.
1|
1|The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a
1|scared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses
1|increased their speed.
1|
1|"It's a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!" shouted the tall
1|youth. "Don't let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!"
1|shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.
1|
1|Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the
1|crowd went in the direction of the Lubyanka Street.
1|
1|"There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
1|perish. Do they think we're dogs?" voices in the crowd were heard
1|saying more and more frequently.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIV
1|
1|
1|On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with
1|Kutuzov, Count Rostopchin had returned to Moscow mortified and
1|offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war,
1|and because Kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in
1|the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed
1|to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital
1|and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite
1|irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and
1|surprised by all this, Rostopchin had returned to Moscow. After supper
1|he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon
1|after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kutuzov. This
1|letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops
1|through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond
1|Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchin. He had known that Moscow
1|would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day
1|with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but ever since the battle of
1|Borodino, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle
1|had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle,
1|and since then the government property had been removed every night,
1|and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopchin's own
1|permission. Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated
1|the count, coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order
1|from Kutuzov, and received at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.
1|
1|When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his
1|actions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated
1|by two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow
1|and expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this
1|twofold aim all Rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable. "Why
1|were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of
1|corn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into
1|believing that Moscow would not be given up--and thereby ruined?"
1|"To preserve the tranquillity of the city," explains Count Rostopchin.
1|"Why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices, and
1|Leppich's balloon and other articles removed?" "To leave the town
1|empty," explains Count Rostopchin. One need only admit that public
1|tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification.
1|
1|All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude
1|for public tranquillity.
1|
1|On what, then, was Count Rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity of
1|Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any
1|probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving
1|it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause
1|the masses to riot?
1|
1|Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling
1|an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than
1|ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of
1|September, and except for a mob in the governor's courtyard, assembled
1|there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would
1|have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if
1|after the battle of Borodino, when the surrender of Moscow became
1|certain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting the
1|people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to
1|remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and
1|had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned.
1|
1|Rostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and
1|impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative
1|circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed
1|himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy's entry into Smolensk he
1|had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular
1|feeling of "the heart of Russia." Not only did it seem to him (as to
1|all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of
1|Moscow's inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental
1|attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a
1|coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not
1|understand from those in authority. Rostopchin was so pleased with the
1|fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it,
1|that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow
1|without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt
1|the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did
1|not know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the
1|last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and
1|did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If
1|the government offices were removed, this was only done on the
1|demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was
1|absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the
1|case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had
1|long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his
1|intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt
1|himself mentally to this new position of affairs.
1|
1|All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful
1|and had any effect on the people is another question) had been
1|simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of
1|patriotic hatred of the French.
1|
1|But when events assumed their true historical character, when
1|expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it
1|was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle,
1|when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question
1|before Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one
1|man, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action
1|all the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by
1|Rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself
1|ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.
1|
1|When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory
1|note from Kutuzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself
1|to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state
1|property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it
1|was no longer possible to take the whole of it away.
1|
1|"Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?" he
1|ruminated. "Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow
1|firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!
1|Traitors!" he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and
1|traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
1|they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous
1|position in which he found himself.
1|
1|All that night Count Rostopchin issued orders, for which people came
1|to him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the
1|count so morose and irritable.
1|
1|"Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar's Department has
1|sent for instructions... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from
1|the University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...
1|asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire
1|Brigade? From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of
1|the lunatic asylum..." All night long such announcements were
1|continually being received by the count.
1|
1|To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating
1|that orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair,
1|carefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that
1|that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that
1|might happen.
1|
1|"Oh, tell that blockhead," he said in reply to the question from the
1|Registrar's Department, "that he should remain to guard his documents.
1|Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They
1|have horses, let them be off to Vladimir, and not leave them to the
1|French."
1|
1|"Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:
1|what are your commands?"
1|
1|"My commands? Let them go away, that's all.... And let the
1|lunatics out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God
1|evidently means these other madmen to be free."
1|
1|In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count
1|Rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor:
1|
1|"Do you expect me to give you two battalions--which we have not
1|got--for a convoy? Release them, that's all about it!"
1|
1|"Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkov,
1|Vereshchagin..."
1|
1|"Vereshchagin! Hasn't he been hanged yet?" shouted Rostopchin.
1|"Bring him to me!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXV
1|
1|
1|Toward nine o'clock in the morning, when the troops were already
1|moving through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for
1|instructions. Those who were able to get away were going of their
1|own accord, those who remained behind decided for themselves what they
1|must do.
1|
1|The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki, and
1|sat in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.
1|
1|In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that
1|it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule
1|is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable
1|every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts.
1|While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his
1|frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people
1|and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the
1|ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea
1|begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer
1|possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion,
1|the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the
1|administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power,
1|becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.
1|
1|Rostopchin felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.
1|
1|The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to
1|see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that
1|the horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent
1|of police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he
1|had received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected
1|in the courtyard and wished to see him.
1|
1|Without saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his
1|light, luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold
1|of the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he
1|had a better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in
1|front, flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The
1|blood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of
1|voices was audible through the closed window.
1|
1|"Is my carriage ready?" asked Rostopchin, stepping back from the
1|window.
1|
1|"It is, your excellency," replied the adjutant.
1|
1|Rostopchin went again to the balcony door.
1|
1|"But what do they want?" he asked the superintendent of police.
1|
1|"Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your
1|orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about
1|treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency--I hardly
1|managed to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest..."
1|
1|"You may go. I don't need you to tell me what to do!" exclaimed
1|Rostopchin angrily.
1|
1|He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.
1|
1|"This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have
1|done with me!" thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled
1|up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might
1|be attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was
1|mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it.
1|"Here is that mob, the dregs of the people," he thought as he gazed at
1|the crowd: "this rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a
1|victim," he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his
1|arm. And this thought occurred to him just because he himself
1|desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.
1|
1|"Is the carriage ready?" he asked again.
1|
1|"Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchagin? He
1|is waiting at the porch," said the adjutant.
1|
1|"Ah!" exclaimed Rostopchin, as if struck by an unexpected
1|recollection.
1|
1|And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the
1|balcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed,
1|and all eyes were raised to the count.
1|
1|"Good morning, lads!" said the count briskly and loudly. "Thank
1|you for coming. I'll come out to you in a moment, but we must first
1|settle with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the
1|ruin of Moscow. Wait for me!"
1|
1|And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed
1|the door behind him.
1|
1|A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd.
1|"He'll settle with all the villains, you'll see! And you said the
1|French... He'll show you what law is!" the mob were saying as if
1|reproving one another for their lack of confidence.
1|
1|A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,
1|gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved
1|eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchin, coming out
1|there with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking
1|someone.
1|
1|"Where is he?" he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man
1|coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a
1|long thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again
1|covered by short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue
1|cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty
1|hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty,
1|trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which
1|hampered his irresolute movements.
1|
1|"Ah!" said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the
1|young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the
1|porch. "Put him there."
1|
1|The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the
1|spot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which
1|chafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed,
1|and submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.
1|
1|For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on
1|the step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the
1|people, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs,
1|groans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.
1|
1|While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step
1|Rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.
1|
1|"Lads!" said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. "This man,
1|Vereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing."
1|
1|The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a
1|submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated
1|young face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down
1|hopelessly. At the count's first words he raised it slowly and
1|looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet
1|his eye. But Rostopchin did not look at him. A vein in the young man's
1|long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and
1|suddenly his face flushed.
1|
1|All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered
1|more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled
1|sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.
1|
1|"He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to
1|Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian
1|name, he has caused Moscow to perish," said Rostopchin in a sharp,
1|even voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who continued
1|to stand in the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight,
1|he raised his arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:
1|
1|"Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you."
1|
1|The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to
1|one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling
1|atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,
1|uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those
1|standing in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place
1|before them, all stood with wide open eyes and mouths, straining
1|with all their strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing
1|behind them.
1|
1|"Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian
1|name!" shouted Rostopchin. "Cut him down. I command it."
1|
1|Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin's
1|voice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.
1|
1|"Count!" exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchagin in
1|the midst of the momentary silence that ensued, "Count! One God is
1|above us both...." He lifted his head and again the thick vein in
1|his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in
1|his face.
1|
1|He did not finish what he wished to say.
1|
1|"Cut him down! I command it..." shouted Rostopchin, suddenly growing
1|pale like Vereshchagin.
1|
1|"Draw sabers!" cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.
1|
1|Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching
1|the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The
1|tall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm,
1|stood beside Vereshchagin.
1|
1|"Saber him!" the dragoon officer almost whispered.
1|
1|And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,
1|struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.
1|
1|"Ah!" cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking round with a
1|frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him.
1|A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. "O Lord!"
1|exclaimed a sorrowful voice.
1|
1|But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from
1|Vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was
1|fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that
1|had held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and
1|must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by
1|the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last
1|wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from
1|the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and
1|engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow.
1|Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands,
1|rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled,
1|seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him
1|under the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.
1|
1|Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth. And
1|the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who
1|tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd.
1|It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding
1|youth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, despite the
1|feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had
1|been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and tearing at
1|Vereshchagin were unable to kill him, for the crowd pressed from all
1|sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it
1|impossible for them either to kill him or let him go.
1|
1|"Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold
1|Christ.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture
1|serves a thief right. Use the hatchet!... What--still alive?"
1|
1|Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a
1|long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his
1|prostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one
1|came up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and
1|astonishment pushed back again.
1|
1|"O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?"
1|voices in the crowd could be heard saying. "Quite a young fellow
1|too... must have been a merchant's son. What men!... and they say he's
1|not the right one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there's
1|another has been beaten too--they say he's nearly done for.... Oh, the
1|people... Aren't they afraid of sinning?..." said the same mob now,
1|looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long, thin,
1|half-severed neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust.
1|
1|A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse
1|in his excellency's courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it
1|away. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it
1|along the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its
1|long neck trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back
1|from it.
1|
1|At the moment when Vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with
1|savage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchin suddenly turned pale
1|and, instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage
1|awaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing
1|where and why, along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground
1|floor. The count's face was white and he could not control the
1|feverish twitching of his lower jaw.
1|
1|"This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,
1|please..." said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.
1|
1|Count Rostopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went
1|in the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his caleche.
1|The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He
1|hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his
1|country house in Sokolniki.
1|
1|When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer hear the
1|shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with
1|dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
1|subordinates. "The mob is terrible--disgusting," he said to himself in
1|French. "They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease."
1|"Count! One God is above us both!"--Vereshchagin's words suddenly
1|recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this
1|was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled
1|disdainfully at himself. "I had other duties," thought he. "The people
1|had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing
1|for the public good"--and he began thinking of his social duties to
1|his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself--not
1|himself as Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore
1|Vasilyevich Rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good)
1|but himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the
1|Tsar. "Had I been simply Theodore Vasilyevich my course of action
1|would have been quite different, but it was my duty to safeguard my
1|life and dignity as commander in chief."
1|
1|Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no
1|longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin grew
1|physically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became
1|physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally
1|tranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopchin was not a new
1|one. Since the world began and men have killed one another no one
1|has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without
1|comforting himself with this same idea. This idea is le bien public,
1|the hypothetical welfare of other people.
1|
1|To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he
1|who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies.
1|And Rostopchin now knew it.
1|
1|Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but
1|he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully
1|contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a
1|criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.
1|
1|"Vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death," thought
1|Rostopchin (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchagin to
1|hard labor), "he was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go
1|unpunished and so I have killed two birds with one stone: to appease
1|the mob I gave them a victim and at the same time punished a
1|miscreant."
1|
1|Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about
1|domestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.
1|
1|Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the
1|Sokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but
1|considering what was to come. He was driving to the Yauza bridge where
1|he had heard that Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchin was mentally preparing
1|the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutuzov for
1|his deception. He would make that foxy old courtier feel that the
1|responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the
1|abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded
1|it) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he
1|would say to Kutuzov, Rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and
1|gazed sternly from side to side.
1|
1|The Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of
1|the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in
1|white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting
1|and gesticulating.
1|
1|One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin's
1|carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons looked
1|with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and
1|especially at the one running toward them.
1|
1|Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering
1|dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on
1|Rostopchin, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to
1|him to stop. The lunatic's solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow,
1|with its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with
1|saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.
1|
1|"Stop! Pull up, I tell you!" he cried in a piercing voice, and again
1|shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.
1|
1|Coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it.
1|
1|"Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead.
1|They stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall
1|rise. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown...
1|Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!" he cried,
1|raising his voice higher and higher.
1|
1|Count Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd
1|closed in on Vereshchagin. He turned away. "Go fas... faster!" he
1|cried in a trembling voice to his coachman. The caleche flew over
1|the ground as fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time
1|Count Rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing
1|fainter in the distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the
1|astonished, frightened, bloodstained face of "the traitor" in the
1|fur-lined coat.
1|
1|Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchin already felt that it
1|had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt
1|clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with
1|time, but that the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in
1|his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He
1|seemed still to hear the sound of his own words: "Cut him down! I
1|command it...."
1|
1|"Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said
1|them.... I need not have said them," he thought. "And then nothing
1|would have happened." He saw the frightened and then infuriated face
1|of the dragoon who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid
1|reproach that boy in the fur-lined coat had turned upon him. "But I
1|did not do it for my own sake. I was bound to act that way.... The
1|mob, the traitor... the public welfare," thought he.
1|
1|Troops were still crowding at the Yauza bridge. It was hot. Kutuzov,
1|dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his
1|whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily. A man in a
1|general's uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said
1|something in French. It was Count Rostopchin. He told Kutuzov that
1|he had come because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army
1|remained.
1|
1|"Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not
1|told me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle;
1|all this would not have happened," he said.
1|
1|Kutuzov looked at Rostopchin as if, not grasping what was said to
1|him, he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment
1|on the face of the man addressing him. Rostopchin grew confused and
1|became silent. Kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his
1|penetrating gaze from Rostopchin's face muttered softly:
1|
1|"No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!"
1|
1|Whether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he
1|spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be
1|meaningless, at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and hastily left
1|him. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count
1|Rostopchin, took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he
1|began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVI
1|
1|
1|Toward four o'clock in the afternoon Murat's troops were entering
1|Moscow. In front rode a detachment of Wurttemberg hussars and behind
1|them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.
1|
1|About the middle of the Arbat Street, near the Church of the
1|Miraculous Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the
1|advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the
1|citadel, le Kremlin.
1|
1|Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow.
1|They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired
1|commander dressed up in feathers and gold.
1|
1|"Is that their Tsar himself? He's not bad!" low voices could be
1|heard saying.
1|
1|An interpreter rode up to the group.
1|
1|"Take off your cap... your caps!" These words went from one to
1|another in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and
1|asked if it was far to the Kremlin. The porter, listening in
1|perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that
1|the interpreter was speaking Russian, did not understand what was
1|being said to him and slipped behind the others.
1|
1|Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the
1|Russian army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and
1|several voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French
1|officer, returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat
1|and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and
1|that there was probably an ambuscade there.
1|
1|"Good!" said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his
1|suite, ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the
1|gates.
1|
1|The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and
1|advanced up the Arbat. When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka
1|Street they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers
1|superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin
1|through field glasses.
1|
1|The bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound
1|troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few
1|infantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had
1|been put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as
1|soon as an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was
1|standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and
1|the latter ran back again with his men.
1|
1|The sound of three more shots came from the gate.
1|
1|One shot struck a French soldier's foot, and from behind the screens
1|came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a
1|word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of
1|the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined
1|concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from
1|the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvizhenka,
1|Mokhavaya, or Kutafyev Street, nor the Troitsa Gate (places familiar
1|in Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove
1|sanguinary. And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the
1|gates ceased. The guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash
1|off their linstocks, and an officer gave the word "Fire!" This was
1|followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot, one after
1|another. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the
1|wooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over
1|the Square.
1|
1|A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the
1|stone-built Kremlin had died away the French heard a strange sound
1|above their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and
1|circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings.
1|Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway
1|and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a
1|peasant's coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French.
1|"Fire!" repeated the officer once more, and the reports of a musket
1|and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The gate was again
1|hidden by smoke.
1|
1|Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry
1|soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three
1|wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot
1|of the wall, toward the Znamenka.
1|
1|"Clear that away!" said the officer, pointing to the beams and the
1|corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw
1|the corpses over the parapet.
1|
1|Who these men were nobody knew. "Clear that away!" was all that
1|was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed
1|later on that they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few
1|eloquent lines to their memory: "These wretches had occupied the
1|sacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal,
1|and fired" (the wretches) "at the French. Some of them were sabered
1|and the Kremlin was purged of their presence."
1|
1|Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered
1|the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of
1|the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the
1|Square for fuel and kindled fires there.
1|
1|Other detachments passed through the Kremlin and encamped along
1|the Moroseyka, the Lubyanka, and Pokrovka Streets. Others quartered
1|themselves along the Vozdvizhenka, the Nikolski, and the Tverskoy
1|Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French
1|were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in
1|it as in a camp.
1|
1|Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their
1|original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order.
1|It was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army.
1|But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into
1|their different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various
1|regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the
1|army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript,
1|neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When
1|five weeks later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed
1|an army. They were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of
1|articles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man
1|when he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but
1|merely to keep what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its
1|paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts
1|will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore
1|perishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish
1|because they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they
1|had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to
1|open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment
1|had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left.
1|Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the
1|windows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and
1|storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the
1|yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors,
1|lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with
1|rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or
1|caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the
1|shops and houses--but there was no army.
1|
1|Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day
1|forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding
1|any violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a
1|roll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures the
1|men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the
1|wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As
1|a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren
1|field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as
1|soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over
1|the wealthy city.
1|
1|No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers--like water
1|percolating through sand--spread irresistibly through the city in
1|all directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched. The
1|cavalry, on entering a merchant's house that had been abandoned and
1|finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,
1|all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of
1|them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and
1|quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they
1|had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the
1|streets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been
1|abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the
1|taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were
1|involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had
1|been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select
1|caleches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had
1|remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby
1|to secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth
1|and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the
1|French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where,
1|they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed
1|the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground
1|both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in
1|the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted
1|city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the
1|army and the wealthy city.
1|
1|
1|The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce de
1|Rostopchine,* the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,
1|however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning
1|of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people,
1|responsible for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a
1|position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite
1|apart from whether it had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior
1|fire engines. Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of
1|shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several
1|days. A town built of wood, where scarcely a day passes without
1|conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police
1|force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left
1|it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of
1|the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals
1|twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the
1|villages of any district and the number of fires in that district
1|immediately increases. How much then must the probability of fire be
1|increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are
1|quartered. "Le patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine" and the barbarity of
1|the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire
1|by the soldiers' pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the
1|carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even
1|if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any
1|reason to burn the houses--in any case a troublesome and dangerous
1|thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same
1|thing would have happened without any incendiarism.
1|
1|
1|*To Rostopchin's ferocious patriotism.
1|
1|
1|However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchin's
1|ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later
1|on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is
1|impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of
1|the fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house
1|must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are
1|allowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its
1|inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not
1|by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not
1|remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its
1|inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and
1|salt, nor bring them the keys of the city.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XXVII
1|
1|
1|The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it
1|did, only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the
1|evening of the second of September.
1|
1|After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,
1|Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely
1|obsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this
1|thought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of
1|the past, understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and
1|heard appeared to him like a dream.
1|
1|He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life's
1|demands that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was
1|unable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexeevich's house, on the
1|plea of sorting the deceased's books and papers, only in search of
1|rest from life's turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph
1|Alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm
1|thoughts, quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he
1|felt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph
1|Alexeevich's study he really found it. When he sat with his elbows
1|on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study,
1|calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after
1|another in his imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodino and
1|of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared
1|with the truth, simplicity, and strength of the class of men he
1|mentally classed as they. When Gerasim roused him from his reverie the
1|idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow
1|which he knew was projected. And with that object he had asked Gerasim
1|to get him a peasant's coat and a pistol, confiding to him his
1|intentions of remaining in Joseph Alexeevich's house and keeping his
1|name secret. Then during the first day spent in inaction and
1|solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic
1|manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously
1|occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in
1|connection with Bonaparte's more than once vaguely presented itself.
1|But the idea that he, L'russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit
1|to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
1|often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.
1|
1|When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part
1|among the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the
1|Rostovs and Natasha had said to him: "Are you remaining in
1|Moscow?... How splendid!" the thought flashed into his mind that it
1|really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to
1|remain there and do what he was predestined to do.
1|
1|Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
1|any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he
1|returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he
1|suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
1|had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in
1|Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and
1|either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe--which it
1|seemed to him was solely due to Napoleon.
1|
1|Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte's life in
1|1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been
1|shot. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out
1|his design excited him still more.
1|
1|Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this
1|purpose. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and
1|suffering in view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had
1|caused him to go to Mozhaysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way
1|to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away
1|from his home and, in place of the luxury and comfort to which he
1|was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the
1|same food as Gerasim. The other was that vague and quite Russian
1|feeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial, and
1|human--for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest
1|good in the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange and
1|fascinating feeling at the Sloboda Palace, when he had suddenly felt
1|that wealth, power, and life--all that men so painstakingly acquire
1|and guard--if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with
1|which it can all be renounced.
1|
1|It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his
1|last penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for
1|no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money
1|he possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions
1|which from an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it
1|were, his personal power and strength, affirming the existence of a
1|higher, nonhuman criterion of life.
1|
1|From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the
1|first time at the Sloboda Palace he had been continuously under its
1|influence, but only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at
1|this moment Pierre was supported in his design and prevented from
1|renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction. If he
1|were now to leave Moscow like everyone else, his flight from home, the
1|peasant coat, the pistol, and his announcement to the Rostovs that
1|he would remain in Moscow would all become not merely meaningless
1|but contemptible and ridiculous, and to this Pierre was very
1|sensitive.
1|
1|Pierre's physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded
1|to his mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he
1|drank during those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty
1|unchanged linen, two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa
1|without bedding--all this kept him in a state of excitement
1|bordering on insanity.
1|
1|It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The French had already
1|entered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only
1|thought about his undertaking, going over its minutest details in
1|his mind. In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either
1|the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon, but with
1|extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own
1|destruction and heroic endurance.
1|
1|"Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!" he
1|thought. "Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol
1|or dagger? But that is all the same! 'It is not I but the hand of
1|Providence that punishes thee,' I shall say," thought he, imagining
1|what he would say when killing Napoleon. "Well then, take me and
1|execute me!" he went on, speaking to himself and bowing his head
1|with a sad but firm expression.
1|
1|While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to
1|himself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold
1|appeared the figure of Makar Alexeevich, always so timid before but
1|now quite transformed.
1|
1|His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was
1|obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but
1|noticing embarrassment on Pierre's face immediately grew bold and,
1|staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.
1|
1|"They're frightened," he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. "I
1|say I won't surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?"
1|
1|He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
1|with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.
1|
1|Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexeevich, stopped
1|him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre,
1|coming out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the
1|half-crazy old man. Makar Alexeevich, frowning with exertion, held
1|on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic
1|fancy in his head.
1|
1|"To arms! Board them! No, you shan't get it," he yelled.
1|
1|"That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness--please, sir,
1|to let go! Please, sir..." pleaded Gerasim, trying carefully to
1|steer Makar Alexeevich by the elbows back to the door.
1|
1|"Who are you? Bonaparte!..." shouted Makar Alexeevich.
1|
1|"That's not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow
1|me to have the pistol."
1|
1|"Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?" shouted Makar
1|Alexeevich, brandishing the pistol. "Board them!"
1|
1|"Catch hold!" whispered Gerasim to the porter.
1|
1|They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the
1|door.
1|
1|The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle
1|and of a tipsy, hoarse voice.
1|
1|Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated
1|from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.
1|
1|"It's them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!" she
1|cried.
1|
1|Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go, and in the now
1|silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front
1|door could be heard.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXVIII
1|
1|
1|Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he
1|would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood
1|at the half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as
1|soon as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre
1|did not retire--an irresistible curiosity kept him there.
1|
1|There were two of them. One was an officer--a tall, soldierly,
1|handsome man--the other evidently a private or an orderly,
1|sunburned, short, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull
1|expression. The officer walked in front, leaning on a stick and
1|slightly limping. When he had advanced a few steps he stopped,
1|having apparently decided that these were good quarters, turned
1|round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in a loud voice of
1|command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done that, the
1|officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his
1|mustache and lightly touched his hat.
1|
1|"Bonjour, la compagnie!"* said he gaily, smiling and looking about
1|him.
1|
1|
1|*"Good day, everybody!"
1|
1|
1|No one gave any reply.
1|
1|"Vous etes le bourgeois?"* the officer asked Gerasim.
1|
1|
1|*"Are you the master here?"
1|
1|
1|Gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.
1|
1|"Quartier, quartier, logement!" said the officer, looking down at
1|the little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. "Les
1|francais sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fachons
1|pas, mon vieux!"* added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerasim
1|on the shoulder. "Well, does no one speak French in this
1|establishment?" he asked again in French, looking around and meeting
1|Pierre's eyes. Pierre moved away from the door.
1|
1|
1|*"Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good fellows. What
1|the devil! There, don't let us be cross, old fellow!"
1|
1|
1|Again the officer turned to Gerasim and asked him to show him the
1|rooms in the house.
1|
1|"Master, not here--don't understand... me, you..." said Gerasim,
1|trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.
1|
1|Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before
1|Gerasim's nose, intimating that he did not understand him either,
1|and moved, limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre
1|wished to go away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makar
1|Alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his
1|hand. With a madman's cunning, Makar Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman,
1|raised his pistol, and took aim.
1|
1|"Board them!" yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger.
1|Hearing the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment
1|Pierre threw himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and
1|struck up the pistol Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the
1|trigger, there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a
1|cloud of smoke. The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.
1|
1|Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French,
1|Pierre, snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to
1|the officer and addressed him in French.
1|
1|"You are not wounded?" he asked.
1|
1|"I think not," answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. "But
1|I have had a lucky escape this time," he added, pointing to the
1|damaged plaster of the wall. "Who is that man?" said he, looking
1|sternly at Pierre.
1|
1|"Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred," said Pierre
1|rapidly, quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. "He is
1|an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing."
1|
1|The officer went up to Makar Alexeevich and took him by the collar.
1|
1|Makar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about
1|to fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.
1|
1|"Brigand! You shall pay for this," said the Frenchman, letting go of
1|him. "We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon
1|traitors," he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine
1|energetic gesture.
1|
1|Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold
1|that drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence
1|with the same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with
1|a smile. For a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome
1|face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out
1|his hand.
1|
1|"You have saved my life. You are French," said he.
1|
1|For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman
1|could perform a great deed, and to save his life--the life of M.
1|Ramballe, captain of the 13th Light Regiment--was undoubtedly a very
1|great deed.
1|
1|But however indubitable that conclusion and the officer's conviction
1|based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.
1|
1|"I am Russian," he said quickly.
1|
1|"Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others," said the officer, waving his
1|finger before his nose and smiling. "You shall tell me all about
1|that presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what
1|are we to do with this man?" he added, addressing himself to Pierre as
1|to a brother.
1|
1|Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that
1|loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the
1|officer's look and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again
1|explained who Makar Alexeevich was and how just before their arrival
1|that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had
1|not had time to recover from him, and begged the officer to let the
1|deed go unpunished.
1|
1|The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with
1|his arm.
1|
1|"You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant
1|it you. Lead that man away!" said he quickly and energetically, and
1|taking the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for
1|saving his life, he went with him into the room.
1|
1|The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage
1|asking what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish
1|the culprits, but the officer sternly checked them.
1|
1|"You will be called in when you are wanted," he said.
1|
1|The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile
1|had time to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.
1|
1|"Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen," said
1|he. "Shall I serve them up?"
1|
1|"Yes, and some wine," answered the captain.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXIX
1|
1|
1|When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter
1|again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and
1|wished to go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so
1|very polite, amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre
1|for saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat
1|down with him in the parlor--the first room they entered. To
1|Pierre's assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the captain,
1|evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering
1|an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre
1|absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all
1|that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his
1|life.
1|
1|Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving
1|the feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre's
1|feelings were, the latter would probably have left him, but the
1|man's animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito," said the officer,
1|looking at Pierre's fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his
1|finger. "I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman
1|never forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my
1|friendship. That is all I can say."
1|
1|There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of
1|the word) in the officer's voice, in the expression of his face and in
1|his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the
1|Frenchman's smile, pressed the hand held out to him.
1|
1|"Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the
1|Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September," he
1|introduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his
1|lips under his mustache. "Will you now be so good as to tell me with
1|whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in
1|the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?"
1|
1|Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,
1|began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason
1|for concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.
1|
1|"Oh, please!" said he. "I understand your reasons. You are an
1|officer... a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us.
1|That's not my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am
1|quite at your service. You belong to the gentry?" he concluded with
1|a shade of inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. "Your
1|baptismal name, if you please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you
1|say.... That's all I want to know."
1|
1|When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and
1|vodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a
1|Russian cellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share
1|his dinner, and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a
1|healthy and hungry man, munching his food rapidly with his strong
1|teeth, continually smacking his lips, and repeating--"Excellent!
1|Delicious!" His face grew red and was covered with perspiration.
1|Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure. Morel, the
1|orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of
1|claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass, taken from the
1|kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to the French
1|and had been given a special name. They called it limonade de cochon
1|(pig's lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he
1|had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had
1|taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and
1|applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to
1|its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
1|Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the
1|captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through
1|dinner.
1|
1|"Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for
1|saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my
1|body already. Here is one I got at Wagram" (he touched his side)
1|"and a second at Smolensk"--he showed a scar on his cheek--"and this
1|leg which as you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh
1|at the great battle of la Moskowa. Sacre Dieu! It was splendid! That
1|deluge of fire was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us
1|there, my word! You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of
1|the cough I caught there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity
1|those who did not see it."
1|
1|"I was there," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes.
1|The great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!" continued the Frenchman.
1|"And you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times--sure as I
1|sit here. Three times we reached the guns and three times we were
1|thrown back like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur
1|Pierre! Your grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close
1|up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine
1|fellows! Our King of Naples, who knows what's what, cried 'Bravo!' Ha,
1|ha! So you are one of us soldiers!" he added, smiling, after a
1|momentary pause. "So much the better, so much the better, Monsieur
1|Pierre! Terrible in battle... gallant... with the fair" (he winked and
1|smiled), "that's what the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren't they?"
1|
1|The captain was so naively and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so
1|pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked
1|merrily at him. Probably the word "gallant" turned the captain's
1|thoughts to the state of Moscow.
1|
1|"Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left
1|Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?"
1|
1|"Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered
1|it?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Ha, ha, ha!" The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle,
1|patting Pierre on the shoulder. "What a thing to say!" he exclaimed.
1|"Paris?... But Paris, Paris..."
1|
1|"Paris--the capital of the world," Pierre finished his remark for
1|him.
1|
1|The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in
1|the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly
1|eyes.
1|
1|"Well, if you hadn't told me you were Russian, I should have wagered
1|that you were Parisian! You have that... I don't know what, that..."
1|and having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.
1|
1|"I have been in Paris. I spent years there," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn't know
1|Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is
1|Talma, la Duchenois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards," and
1|noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before,
1|he added quickly: "There is only one Paris in the world. You have been
1|to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I don't esteem you the
1|less for it."
1|
1|Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days
1|he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre
1|involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.
1|
1|"To return to your ladies--I hear they are lovely. What a wretched
1|idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army
1|is in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants,
1|now--that's another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know
1|us better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome,
1|Warsaw, all the world's capitals.... We are feared, but we are
1|loved. We are nice to know. And then the Emperor..." he began, but
1|Pierre interrupted him.
1|
1|"The Emperor," Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
1|embarrassed, "is the Emperor...?"
1|
1|"The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius--that's
1|what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure
1|you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant
1|count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I
1|could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has
1|covered France. When I understood what he wanted--when I saw that he
1|was preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself:
1|'That is a monarch,' and I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes,
1|mon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages past or future."
1|
1|"Is he in Moscow?" Pierre stammered with a guilty look.
1|
1|The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.
1|
1|"No, he will make his entry tomorrow," he replied, and continued his
1|talk.
1|
1|Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at
1|the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Wurttemberg hussars
1|had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the
1|captain's horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because
1|the hussars did not understand what was said to them in French.
1|
1|The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern
1|voice asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding
1|officer, and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that
1|were already occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the
1|two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his
1|commanding officer, but in reply to the third question which he did
1|not understand said, introducing broken French into his own German,
1|that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had
1|ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who
1|knew German, translated what the German said to the captain and gave
1|the captain's reply to the Wurttemberg hussar in German. When he had
1|understood what was said to him, the German submitted and took his men
1|elsewhere. The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in
1|a loud voice.
1|
1|When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as
1|before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He
1|really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and
1|he was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the
1|position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that
1|the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him.
1|Painful as that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the
1|moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The
1|few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this
1|good-natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which
1|he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the
1|execution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were
1|ready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still
1|considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the
1|evildoer, but now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know
1|why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his
1|intention. He struggled against the confession of his weakness but
1|dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy
1|frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice,
1|had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met.
1|
1|The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a
1|tune.
1|
1|The Frenchman's chatter which had previously amused Pierre now
1|repelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture
1|with which he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. "I
1|will go away immediately. I won't say another word to him," thought
1|Pierre. He thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange
1|feeling of weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go
1|away, but could not do so.
1|
1|The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up
1|and down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as
1|if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.
1|
1|"The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful," he suddenly
1|said. "He's a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he's a
1|German." He sat down facing Pierre. "By the way, you know German,
1|then?"
1|
1|Pierre looked at him in silence.
1|
1|"What is the German for 'shelter'?"
1|
1|"Shelter?" Pierre repeated. "The German for shelter is Unterkunft."
1|
1|"How do you say it?" the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.
1|
1|"Unterkunft," Pierre repeated.
1|
1|"Onterkoff," said the captain and looked at Pierre for some
1|seconds with laughing eyes. "These Germans are first-rate fools, don't
1|you think so, Monsieur Pierre?" he concluded.
1|
1|"Well, let's have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall
1|we? Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!" he called out
1|gaily.
1|
1|Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at
1|Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled
1|expression on his companion's face. Ramballe, with genuine distress
1|and sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.
1|
1|"There now, we're sad," said he, touching Pierre's hand. "Have I
1|upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?" he asked Pierre.
1|"Perhaps it's the state of affairs?"
1|
1|Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman's
1|eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.
1|
1|"Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
1|you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and
1|death. I say it with my hand on my heart!" said he, striking his
1|chest.
1|
1|"Thank you," said Pierre.
1|
1|The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned
1|that "shelter" was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly
1|brightened.
1|
1|"Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!" he cried gaily,
1|filling two glasses with wine.
1|
1|Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied
1|his too, again pressed Pierre's hand, and leaned his elbows on the
1|table in a pensive attitude.
1|
1|"Yes, my dear friend," he began, "such is fortune's caprice. Who
1|would have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons
1|in the service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am
1|in Moscow with him. I must tell you, mon cher," he continued in the
1|sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story,
1|"that our name is one of the most ancient in France."
1|
1|And with a Frenchman's easy and naive frankness the captain told
1|Pierre the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and
1|manhood, and all about his relations and his financial and family
1|affairs, "ma pauvre mere" playing of course an important part in the
1|story.
1|
1|"But all that is only life's setting, the real thing is love--love! Am
1|I not right, Monsieur Pierre?" said he, growing animated. "Another
1|glass?"
1|
1|Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.
1|
1|"Oh, women, women!" and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at
1|Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.
1|
1|There were very many of these, as one could easily believe,
1|looking at the officer's handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the
1|eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe's
1|love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the
1|special charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such
1|sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the
1|charm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre
1|listened to him with curiosity.
1|
1|It was plain that l'amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not
1|that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor
1|was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
1|Natasha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the
1|one he considered the "love of clodhoppers" and the other the "love of
1|simpletons.") L'amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted
1|principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
1|combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.
1|
1|Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
1|fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a
1|charming, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching
1|marquise. The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the
1|daughter, ending in the mother's sacrificing herself and offering
1|her daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the
1|captain, though it was the memory of a distant past. Then he recounted
1|an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover, and
1|he--the lover--assumed the role of the husband, as well as several
1|droll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where "shelter"
1|is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the
1|young girls are "too blonde."
1|
1|Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain's
1|memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face,
1|was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving
1|of life continually occurred in the captain's stories) and the Pole
1|had entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de coeur) while
1|himself entering the French service. The captain was happy, the
1|enchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by
1|magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as
1|he did so: "I have saved your life, and I save your honor!" Having
1|repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a
1|shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this
1|touching recollection.
1|
1|Listening to the captain's tales, Pierre--as often happens late in
1|the evening and under the influence of wine--followed all that was
1|told him, understood it all, and at the same time followed a train
1|of personal memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his
1|mind. While listening to these love stories his own love for Natasha
1|unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that
1|love in his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe's
1|tales. Listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty,
1|Pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting
1|with the object of his love at the Sukharev water tower. At the time
1|of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him--he had not
1|even once recalled it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting
1|had had in it something very important and poetic.
1|
1|"Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you," he now seemed
1|to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes,
1|her smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and
1|there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.
1|
1|Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the
1|captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to
1|sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate
1|husband.
1|
1|Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need
1|to express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that
1|he understood love for a women somewhat differently. He said that in
1|all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she
1|could never be his.
1|
1|"Tiens!" said the captain.
1|
1|Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
1|years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
1|young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.
1|Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think
1|of her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything
1|in the world, and especially therefore above himself.
1|
1|When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether
1|he understood that.
1|
1|The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not
1|understand it he begged Pierre to continue.
1|
1|"Platonic love, clouds..." he muttered.
1|
1|Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or
1|the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of
1|those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these
1|things together, something loosened Pierre's tongue. Speaking
1|thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the whole
1|story of his life: his marriage, Natasha's love for his best friend,
1|her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her.
1|Urged on by Ramballe's questions he also told what he had at first
1|concealed--his own position and even his name.
1|
1|More than anything else in Pierre's story the captain was
1|impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in
1|Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city,
1|but remained there concealing his name and station.
1|
1|When it was late at night they went out together into the street.
1|The night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokrovka
1|a fire glowed--the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To
1|the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
1|opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in
1|Pierre's heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerasim, the cook, and
1|two Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible
1|remarks in two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow
1|seen in the town.
1|
1|There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the
1|immense city.
1|
1|Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
1|glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. "There now,
1|how good it is, what more does one need?" thought he. And suddenly
1|remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he
1|leaned against the fence to save himself from falling.
1|
1|Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with
1|unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
1|immediately fell asleep.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXX
1|
1|
1|The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was
1|watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the
1|retreating troops, with many different feelings.
1|
1|The Rostov party spent the night at Mytishchi, fourteen miles from
1|Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road
1|had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been
1|forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided
1|to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next
1|morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they
1|only got as far as Great Mytishchi. At ten o'clock that evening the
1|Rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed
1|in the yards and huts of that large village. The Rostovs' servants and
1|coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to
1|their masters, had supper, fed the horses, and came out into the
1|porches.
1|
1|In a neighboring hut lay Raevski's adjutant with a fractured
1|wrist. The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and
1|piteously, and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the
1|autumn night. He had spent the first night in the same yard as the
1|Rostovs. The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on
1|account of his moaning, and at Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut
1|simply to be farther away from the wounded man.
1|
1|In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above
1|the high body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow
1|of another fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew
1|that it was Little Mytishchi burning--set on fire by Mamonov's
1|Cossacks.
1|
1|"But look here, brothers, there's another fire!" remarked an
1|orderly.
1|
1|All turned their attention to the glow.
1|
1|"But they told us Little Mytishchi had been set on fire by Mamonov's
1|Cossacks."
1|
1|"But that's not Mytishchi, it's farther away."
1|
1|"Look, it must be in Moscow!"
1|
1|Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and
1|sat down on its steps.
1|
1|"It's more to the left, why, Little Mytishchi is over there, and
1|this is right on the other side."
1|
1|Several men joined the first two.
1|
1|"See how it's flaring," said one. "That's a fire in Moscow: either
1|in the Sushchevski or the Rogozhski quarter."
1|
1|No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed
1|silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.
1|
1|Old Daniel Terentich, the count's valet (as he was called), came
1|up to the group and shouted at Mishka.
1|
1|"What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be
1|calling and there's nobody there; go and gather the clothes together."
1|
1|"I only ran out to get some water," said Mishka.
1|
1|"But what do you think, Daniel Terentich? Doesn't it look as if that
1|glow were in Moscow?" remarked one of the footmen.
1|
1|Daniel Terentich made no reply, and again for a long time they
1|were all silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and
1|farther still.
1|
1|"God have mercy.... It's windy and dry..." said another voice.
1|
1|"Just look! See what it's doing now. O Lord! You can even see the
1|crows flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!"
1|
1|"They'll put it out, no fear!"
1|
1|"Who's to put it out?" Daniel Terentich, who had hitherto been
1|silent, was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. "Moscow
1|it is, brothers," said he. "Mother Moscow, the white..." his voice
1|faltered, and he gave way to an old man's sob.
1|
1|And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
1|significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were
1|heard, words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count's old valet.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXI
1|
1|
1|The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that
1|Moscow was burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to
1|look. Sonya and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out
1|with him. Only Natasha and the countess remained in the room. Petya
1|was no longer with the family, he had gone on with his regiment
1|which was making for Troitsa.
1|
1|The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry.
1|Natasha, pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the
1|icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to
1|her father's words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of
1|the adjutant, three houses off.
1|
1|"Oh, how terrible," said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and
1|frightened. "I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there's an awful
1|glow! Natasha, do look! You can see it from the window," she said to
1|her cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.
1|
1|But Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to
1|her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had
1|been in this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sonya, to the
1|surprise and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable
1|reason found it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew's wound and
1|of his being with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry
1|with anyone as she was with Sonya. Sonya had cried and begged to be
1|forgiven and now, as if trying to atone for her fault, paid
1|unceasing attention to her cousin.
1|
1|"Look, Natasha, how dreadfully it is burning!" said she.
1|
1|"What's burning?" asked Natasha. "Oh, yes, Moscow."
1|
1|And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her, she
1|turned her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was
1|evident that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her
1|former attitude.
1|
1|"But you didn't see it!"
1|
1|"Yes, really I did," Natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be
1|left in peace.
1|
1|Both the countess and Sonya understood that, naturally, neither
1|Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of
1|importance to Natasha.
1|
1|The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess
1|went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand
1|as she was wont to do when Natasha was ill, then touched her
1|forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and
1|finally kissed her.
1|
1|"You are cold. You are trembling all over. You'd better lie down,"
1|said the countess.
1|
1|"Lie down? All right, I will. I'll lie down at once," said Natasha.
1|
1|When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was
1|seriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first
1|asked many questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it
1|serious? And could she see him? But after she had been told that she
1|could not see him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was
1|not in danger, she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all,
1|evidently disbelieving what they told her, and convinced that say what
1|she might she would still be told the same. All the way she had sat
1|motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the
1|expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much,
1|and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated
1|herself on arriving. She was planning something and either deciding or
1|had already decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but
1|what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.
1|
1|"Natasha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed."
1|
1|A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame
1|Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.
1|
1|"No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor," Natasha replied
1|irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open
1|window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She
1|put her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her
1|slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame.
1|Natasha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince
1|Andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut
1|across the passage; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her
1|sob. The countess exchanged a look with Sonya.
1|
1|"Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet," said the countess, softly
1|touching Natasha's shoulders. "Come, lie down."
1|
1|"Oh, yes... I'll lie down at once," said Natasha, and began
1|hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.
1|
1|When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket,
1|she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made
1|up on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the
1|front, and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers
1|rapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved
1|from side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked
1|fixedly before her. When her toilet for the night was finished she
1|sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the
1|door.
1|
1|"Natasha, you'd better lie in the middle," said Sonya.
1|
1|"I'll stay here," muttered Natasha. "Do lie down," she added
1|crossly, and buried her face in the pillow.
1|
1|The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undressed hastily and lay
1|down. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left
1|in the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little
1|Mytishchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise
1|of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov's Cossacks had set up across
1|the street, and the adjutant's unceasing moans could still be heard.
1|
1|For a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds that
1|reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First
1|she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed
1|under her, then Madame Schoss' familiar whistling snore and Sonya's
1|gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natasha. Natasha did not
1|answer.
1|
1|"I think she's asleep, Mamma," said Sonya softly.
1|
1|After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one
1|replied.
1|
1|Soon after that Natasha heard her mother's even breathing. Natasha
1|did not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the
1|quilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.
1|
1|As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in
1|a crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near
1|by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of
1|the adjutant was heard. Natasha sat up.
1|
1|"Sonya, are you asleep? Mamma?" she whispered.
1|
1|No one replied. Natasha rose slowly and carefully, crossed
1|herself, and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her
1|slim, supple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping
1|cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few
1|steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle.
1|
1|It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically
1|against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking
1|with alarm and terror and overflowing with love.
1|
1|She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the
1|cold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed
1|her. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over
1|him, and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince
1|Andrew lay. It was dark in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench
1|beside a bed on which something was lying, stood a tallow candle
1|with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.
1|
1|From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew's
1|wound and his presence there, Natasha had resolved to see him. She did
1|not know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but
1|felt the more convinced that it was necessary.
1|
1|All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now
1|that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
1|see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that
1|incessant moaning of the adjutant's? Yes, he was altogether like that.
1|In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she
1|saw an indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised
1|under the quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there,
1|and stood still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her
1|forward. She cautiously took one step and then another, and found
1|herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage. Another
1|man--Timokhin--was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons,
1|and two others--the doctor and a valet--lay on the floor.
1|
1|The valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, kept awake by
1|the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange
1|apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and
1|nightcap. The valet's sleepy, frightened exclamation, "What do you
1|want? What's the matter?" made Natasha approach more swiftly to what
1|was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked,
1|she must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle
1|wick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the
1|quilt, and such as she had always seen him.
1|
1|He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his
1|glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his
1|neck, delicate as a child's, revealed by the turn-down collar of his
1|shirt, gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had
1|never seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift,
1|flexible, youthful movement dropped on her knees.
1|
1|He smiled and held out his hand to her.
1|
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XXXII
1|
1|
1|Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the
1|ambulance station on the field of Borodino. His feverish state and the
1|inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor's
1|opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with
1|pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that
1|his temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.
1|The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
1|remained in the caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself
1|asked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his
1|removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose
1|consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a
1|long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened them and
1|whispered softly: "And the tea?" His remembering such a small detail
1|of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew's pulse,
1|and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He
1|was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did
1|not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering.
1|Timokhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew's regiment, had
1|joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been
1|wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino. They were accompanied by
1|a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.
1|
1|They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking
1|with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to
1|understand and remember something.
1|
1|"I don't want any more. Is Timokhin here?" he asked.
1|
1|Timokhin crept along the bench to him.
1|
1|"I am here, your excellency."
1|
1|"How's your wound?"
1|
1|"Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?"
1|
1|Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.
1|
1|"Couldn't one get a book?" he asked.
1|
1|"What book?"
1|
1|"The Gospels. I haven't one."
1|
1|The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
1|was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly
1|but reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him
1|as he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted
1|the cloak with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the
1|noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began
1|examining that dreadful place. The doctor was very much displeased
1|about something and made a change in the dressings, turning the
1|wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and
1|delirious from the agony. He kept asking them to get him the book
1|and put it under him.
1|
1|"What trouble would it be to you?" he said. "I have not got one.
1|Please get it for me and put it under for a moment," he pleaded in a
1|piteous voice.
1|
1|The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.
1|
1|"You fellows have no conscience," said he to the valet who was
1|pouring water over his hands. "For just one moment I didn't look after
1|you... It's such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it."
1|
1|"By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under
1|him!" said the valet.
1|
1|The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was
1|the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he
1|asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at
1|Mytishchi. After growing confused from pain while being carried into
1|the hut he again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once
1|more recalled all that had happened to him, and above all vividly
1|remembered the moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of
1|the sufferings of a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to
1|him which promised him happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague
1|and indefinite, again possessed his soul. He remembered that he had
1|now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to
1|do with the Gospels. That was why he asked for a copy of them. The
1|uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over
1|again confused his thoughts, and when he came to himself a third
1|time it was in the complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him
1|was sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was
1|shouting and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the
1|table, on the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the
1|head of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick of which
1|was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.
1|
1|His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,
1|feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the
1|power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which
1|to fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from
1|the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in
1|and can then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew's
1|mind was not in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of
1|his mind were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted
1|apart from his will. Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him
1|simultaneously. At times his brain suddenly began to work with a
1|vigor, clearness, and depth it had never reached when he was in
1|health, but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some
1|unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again.
1|
1|"Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be
1|deprived," he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,
1|gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. "A happiness
1|lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act
1|on man--a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving.
1|Every man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was
1|possible only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was
1|the Son...?"
1|
1|And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince
1|Andrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality)
1|a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
1|"piti-piti-piti," and then "titi," and then again "piti-piti-piti,"
1|and "ti-ti" once more. At the same time he felt that above his face,
1|above the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being
1|erected out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this
1|whispered music. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it
1|was difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but
1|nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound
1|of whispered rhythmic music--"it stretches, stretches, spreading out
1|and stretching," said Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to
1|this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and
1|the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a
1|red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and
1|the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face.
1|Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and
1|yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though it
1|knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But
1|besides this there was something else of importance. It was
1|something white by the door--the statue of a sphinx, which also
1|oppressed him.
1|
1|"But perhaps that's my shirt on the table," he thought, "and
1|that's my legs, and that is the door, but why is it always
1|stretching and drawing itself out, and 'piti-piti-piti' and 'ti-ti'
1|and 'piti-piti-piti'...? That's enough, please leave off!" Prince
1|Andrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings
1|again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and
1|force.
1|
1|"Yes--love," he thought again quite clearly. "But not love which
1|loves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some
1|reason, but the love which I--while dying--first experienced when I
1|saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love
1|which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an
1|object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one's neighbors, to
1|love one's enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His
1|manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with
1|human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why
1|I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has
1|become of him? Is he alive?...
1|
1|"When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but
1|divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can
1|destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people
1|have I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as
1|I did her." And he vividly pictured to himself Natasha, not as he
1|had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him
1|delight, but for the first time picturing to himself her soul. And
1|he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now
1|understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her,
1|the cruelty of his rupture with her. "If only it were possible for
1|me to see her once more! Just once, looking into those eyes to say..."
1|
1|
1|"Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!" flopped the
1|fly... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a
1|world of reality and delirium in which something particular was
1|happening. In that world some structure was still being erected and
1|did not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle
1|with its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay
1|near the door; but besides all this something creaked, there was a
1|whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the
1|door. And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very
1|Natasha of whom he had just been thinking.
1|
1|"Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is," thought Prince
1|Andrew, trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face
1|remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer.
1|Prince Andrew wished to return to that former world of pure thought,
1|but he could not, and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft
1|whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed
1|him and stretched out, and the strange face was before him. Prince
1|Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his
1|senses, he moved a little, and suddenly there was a ringing in his
1|ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like a man plunged into water he lost
1|consciousness. When he came to himself, Natasha, that same living
1|Natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure
1|divine love that had been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He
1|realized that it was the real living Natasha, and he was not surprised
1|but quietly happy. Natasha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to
1|stir), with frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her
1|sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it
1|something quivered.
1|
1|Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.
1|
1|"You?" he said. "How fortunate!"
1|
1|With a rapid but careful movement Natasha drew nearer to him on
1|her knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and
1|began kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.
1|
1|"Forgive me!" she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.
1|"Forgive me!"
1|
1|"I love you," said Prince Andrew.
1|
1|"Forgive...!"
1|
1|"Forgive what?" he asked.
1|
1|"Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!" faltered Natasha in a
1|scarcely audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more
1|rapidly, just touching it with her lips.
1|
1|"I love you more, better than before," said Prince Andrew, lifting
1|her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.
1|
1|Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,
1|compassionately, and with joyous love. Natasha's thin pale face,
1|with its swollen lips, was more than plain--it was dreadful. But
1|Prince Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were
1|beautiful. They heard the sound of voices behind them.
1|
1|Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.
1|Timokhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had
1|long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his
1|bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.
1|
1|"What's this?" said the doctor, rising from his bed. "Please go
1|away, madam!"
1|
1|At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her
1|daughter's absence, knocked at the door.
1|
1|Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out of the
1|room and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.
1|
1|
1|From that time, during all the rest of the Rostovs' journey, at
1|every halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natasha never
1|left the wounded Bolkonski, and the doctor had to admit that he had
1|not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in
1|nursing a wounded man.
1|
1|Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew
1|die in her daughter's arms during the journey--as, judging by what the
1|doctor said, it seemed might easily happen--she could not oppose
1|Natasha. Though with the intimacy now established between the
1|wounded man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover
1|their former engagement would be renewed, no one--least of all Natasha
1|and Prince Andrew--spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and
1|death, which hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia, shut
1|out all other considerations.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXIII
1|
1|
1|On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching,
1|the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt
1|uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of
1|something shameful he had done the day before. That something shameful
1|was his yesterday's conversation with Captain Ramballe.
1|
1|It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of
1|doors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an
1|engraved stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table, he
1|remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day.
1|
1|"Am I not too late?" he thought. "No, probably he won't make his
1|entry into Moscow before noon."
1|
1|Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him,
1|but hastened to act.
1|
1|After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to
1|go out. But it then occurred to him for the first time that he
1|certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the
1|streets. It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his
1|wide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his
1|arm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not had time to
1|reload it. "No matter, dagger will do," he said to himself, though
1|when planning his design he had more than once come to the
1|conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been
1|to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as his chief aim
1|consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself
1|that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could
1|to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
1|green sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the
1|pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.
1|
1|Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his
1|head, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or
1|meeting the captain, and passed out into the street.
1|
1|The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much
1|indifference the evening before, had greatly increased during the
1|night. Moscow was on fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage
1|Row, across the river, in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as the
1|barges on the Moskva River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov
1|Bridge, were all ablaze.
1|
1|Pierre's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from there
1|to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat, where he had long before
1|decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses
1|were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.
1|The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he
1|met Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air
1|not of the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets.
1|Both the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise.
1|Besides his height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of
1|suffering in his face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre
1|because they could not make out to what class he could belong. The
1|French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because
1|Pierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with
1|fear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of one
1|house three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians
1|who did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know
1|French.
1|
1|Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel
1|standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the
1|shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man's
1|musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on
1|the other side of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what
1|went on around him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror
1|and haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the
1|previous night's experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was
1|not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had
1|he not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not
1|now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than
1|four hours previously on his way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the
1|Kremlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal
1|study in the Kremlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to
1|measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent
1|looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know
1|this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was
1|tortured--as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is
1|impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its
1|incompatibility with their natures--by the fear of weakening at the
1|decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.
1|
1|Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by
1|instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the
1|Povarskoy.
1|
1|As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and
1|denser--he even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues
1|of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people
1|in the streets and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt
1|that something unusual was happening around him, did not realize that
1|he was approaching the fire. As he was going along a foot path across
1|a wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens
1|of Prince Gruzinski's house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the
1|desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening
1|from a dream and lifted his head.
1|
1|By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of
1|household goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and
1|trunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer
1|young, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and
1|cap. This woman, swaying to and fro and muttering something, was
1|choking with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty
1|short frocks and cloaks, were staring at their mother with a look of
1|stupefaction on their pale frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy
1|of about seven, who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently
1|not his own, was crying in his old nurse's arms. A dirty, barefooted
1|maid was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her pale-colored
1|plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair. The
1|woman's husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the undress
1|uniform of a civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and
1|showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward
1|over his temples, with expressionless face was moving the trunks,
1|which were placed one on another, and was dragging some garments
1|from under them.
1|
1|As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his
1|feet.
1|
1|"Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends...
1|help us, somebody," she muttered between her sobs. "My girl... My
1|daughter! My youngest daughter is left behind. She's burned! Ooh!
1|Was it for this I nursed you.... Ooh!"
1|
1|"Don't, Mary Nikolievna!" said her husband to her in a low voice,
1|evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. "Sister must
1|have taken her, or else where can she be?" he added.
1|
1|"Monster! Villain!" shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to
1|weep. "You have no heart, you don't feel for your own child! Another
1|man would have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and
1|neither a man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man," she
1|went on, addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. "The fire broke
1|out alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out 'Fire!' and we
1|rushed to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is
1|what we have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the
1|rest is lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O
1|Lord!..." and again she began to sob. "My child, my dear one!
1|Burned, burned!"
1|
1|"But where was she left?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
1|might help her.
1|
1|"Oh, dear sir!" she cried, seizing him by the legs. "My
1|benefactor, set my heart at ease.... Aniska, go, you horrid girl, show
1|him the way!" she cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and
1|still farther exposing her long teeth.
1|
1|"Show me the way, show me, I... I'll do it," gasped Pierre rapidly.
1|
1|The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her
1|plait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre
1|felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his
1|head higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift
1|steps he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the
1|Povarskoy. The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues
1|of flame here and there broke through that cloud. A great number of
1|people crowded in front of the conflagration. In the middle of the
1|street stood a French general saying something to those around him.
1|Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing to the spot where the
1|general stood, but the French soldiers stopped him.
1|
1|"On ne passe pas!"* cried a voice.
1|
1|
1|*"You can't pass!"
1|
1|
1|"This way, uncle," cried the girl. "We'll pass through the side
1|street, by the Nikulins'!"
1|
1|Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with
1|her. She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left,
1|and, passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.
1|
1|"It's here, close by," said she and, running across the yard, opened
1|a gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small
1|wooden wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One
1|of its sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames
1|issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof.
1|
1|As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air
1|and involuntarily stopped.
1|
1|"Which is it? Which is your house?" he asked.
1|
1|"Ooh!" wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. "That's it, that was
1|our lodging. You've burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my
1|precious little missy! Ooh!" lamented Aniska, who at the sight of
1|the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings.
1|
1|Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he
1|involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house
1|that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and
1|around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not
1|realize what these men, who were dragging something out, were about;
1|but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber
1|and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that
1|looting was going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.
1|
1|The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings,
1|the whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the
1|people, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick
1|black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here
1|and there dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish
1|scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke and
1|rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating effects
1|of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because
1|at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas
1|that had weighed him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and
1|resolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to
1|dash into that part of it which was still standing, when just above
1|his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound
1|and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him.
1|
1|Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some
1|Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with
1|metal articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the
1|drawer.
1|
1|"What does this fellow want?" shouted one of them referring to
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"There's a child in that house. Haven't you seen a child?" cried
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"What's he talking about? Get along!" said several voices, and one
1|of the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take
1|from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved
1|threateningly toward him.
1|
1|"A child?" shouted a Frenchman from above. "I did hear something
1|squealing in the garden. Perhaps it's his brat that the fellow is
1|looking for. After all, one must be human, you know...."
1|
1|"Where is it? Where?" said Pierre.
1|
1|"There! There!" shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the
1|garden at the back of the house. "Wait a bit--I'm coming down."
1|
1|And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with
1|a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window
1|on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with
1|him into the garden.
1|
1|"Hurry up, you others!" he called out to his comrades. "It's getting
1|hot."
1|
1|When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman
1|pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space
1|where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.
1|
1|"There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!" said the
1|Frenchman. "Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you
1|know!" and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
1|comrades.
1|
1|Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going
1|to take her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly,
1|scrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her mother, began to
1|yell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his
1|arms. She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little
1|hands to pull Pierre's hands away and to bite them with her slobbering
1|mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he
1|had experienced when touching some nasty little animal. But he made an
1|effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large
1|house. It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he had
1|come; the maid, Aniska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a feeling
1|of pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully sobbing child to
1|himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden
1|seeking another way out.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XXXIV
1|
1|
1|Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back
1|with his little burden to the Gruzinski garden at the corner of the
1|Povarskoy. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had
1|set out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and
1|goods that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian
1|families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their
1|belongings, there were several French soldiers in a variety of
1|clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried to find the family
1|of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother
1|and go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to
1|do and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from running, he
1|felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth,
1|animation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to
1|save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging with her little
1|hands to Pierre's coat, sat on his arm gazing about her like some
1|little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight
1|smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
1|frightened, sickly little face.
1|
1|He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left
1|them. He walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various
1|faces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family
1|consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,
1|cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar
1|type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the
1|perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,
1|black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,
1|beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the
1|crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright
1|lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown
1|out onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the
1|old woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless,
1|large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she
1|was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck
1|Pierre and, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to
1|look at her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding
1|those he sought, he stopped and looked about him.
1|
1|With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous
1|than before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered
1|about him.
1|
1|"Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You're of the gentry
1|yourself, aren't you? Whose child is it?" they asked him.
1|
1|Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat
1|who had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked
1|whether anyone knew where she had gone.
1|
1|"Why, that must be the Anferovs," said an old deacon, addressing a
1|pockmarked peasant woman. "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!" he added
1|in his customary bass.
1|
1|"The Anferovs? No," said the woman. "They left in the morning.
1|That must be either Mary Nikolievna's or the Ivanovs'!"
1|
1|"He says 'a woman,' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady," remarked a house
1|serf.
1|
1|"Do you know her? She's thin, with long teeth," said Pierre.
1|
1|"That's Mary Nikolievna! They went inside the garden when these
1|wolves swooped down," said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.
1|
1|"O Lord, have mercy!" added the deacon.
1|
1|"Go over that way, they're there. It's she! She kept on lamenting
1|and crying," continued the woman. "It's she. Here, this way!"
1|
1|But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds
1|been intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was
1|looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone
1|up to them. One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat
1|tied round the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and
1|his feet were bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck
1|Pierre, was a long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in
1|his movements and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a
1|woman's loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian
1|boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the
1|Armenians and, saying something, immediately seized the old man by his
1|legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in
1|the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and
1|with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and
1|silent.
1|
1|"Here, take the child!" said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to
1|the woman, handing the little girl to her. "Give her back to them,
1|give her back!" he almost shouted, putting the child, who began
1|screaming, on the ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the
1|Armenian family.
1|
1|The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had
1|secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.
1|The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre
1|caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to
1|the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from
1|side to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands
1|from his pockets had seized her by the neck.
1|
1|The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same
1|attitude, with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or
1|feel what the soldier was doing to her.
1|
1|While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
1|Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing
1|from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the
1|young woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.
1|
1|"Let that woman alone!" exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious
1|voice, seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him
1|aside.
1|
1|The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing
1|down the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"Voyons, Pas de betises!"* he cried.
1|
1|
1|*"Look here, no nonsense!"
1|
1|
1|Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing
1|and his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted
1|Frenchman and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked
1|him off his feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval
1|were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted
1|patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans
1|came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them.
1|Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only
1|remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that
1|his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood
1|around him and were searching him.
1|
1|"Lieutenant, he has a dagger," were the first words Pierre
1|understood.
1|
1|"Ah, a weapon?" said the officer and turned to the barefooted
1|soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. "All right, you can tell
1|all about it at the court-martial." Then he turned to Pierre. "Do
1|you speak French?"
1|
1|Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply.
1|His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something
1|in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves
1|on both sides of Pierre.
1|
1|"Do you speak French?" the officer asked again, keeping at a
1|distance from Pierre. "Call the interpreter."
1|
1|A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks,
1|and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to
1|be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.
1|
1|"He does not look like a common man," said the interpreter, after
1|a searching look at Pierre.
1|
1|"Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary," remarked the officer.
1|"And ask him who he is," he added.
1|
1|"Who are you?" asked the interpreter in poor Russian. "You must
1|answer the chief."
1|
1|"I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner--take me!"
1|Pierre suddenly replied in French.
1|
1|"Ah, ah!" muttered the officer with a frown. "Well then, march!"
1|
1|A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood
1|the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol
1|started she moved forward.
1|
1|"Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?" said she. "And the
1|little girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she's not
1|theirs?" said the woman.
1|
1|"What does that woman want?" asked the officer.
1|
1|Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight
1|of the little girl he had saved.
1|
1|"What does she want?" he murmured. "She is bringing me my daughter
1|whom I have just saved from the flames," said he. "Good-by!" And
1|without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along
1|with resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.
1|
1|The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various
1|streets of Moscow by Durosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage,
1|and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general
1|opinion which had that day originated among the higher French
1|officers, were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through
1|a number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects:
1|a small shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house
1|serf, besides several looters. But of all these various suspected
1|characters, Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all.
1|When they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the
1|Zubov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed
1|apart under strict guard.

1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being
1|carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between
1|the parties of Rumyantsev, the French, Marya Fedorovna, the Tsarevich,
1|and others, drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But
1|the calm, luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about
1|phantoms and reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made
1|it hard, except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the
1|difficult position of the Russian people. There were the same
1|receptions and balls, the same French theater, the same court
1|interests and service interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the
1|very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the
1|difficulties of the actual position. Stories were whispered of how
1|differently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult
1|circumstances. The Empress Marya, concerned for the welfare of the
1|charitable and educational institutions under her patronage, had given
1|directions that they should all be removed to Kazan, and the things
1|belonging to these institutions had already been packed up. The
1|Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions she would
1|be pleased to give--with her characteristic Russian patriotism had
1|replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for
1|that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally was
1|concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.
1|
1|At Anna Pavlovna's on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of
1|the battle of Borodino, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which
1|was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when
1|sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was
1|regarded as a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince
1|Vasili himself, famed for his elocution, was to read it. (He used to
1|read at the Empress'.) The art of his reading was supposed to lie in
1|rolling out the words, quite independently of their meaning, in a loud
1|and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a
1|tender murmur, so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and
1|the murmur on another. This reading, as was always the case at Anna
1|Pavlovna's soirees, had a political significance. That evening she
1|expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of
1|their visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic
1|temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna Pavlovna, not
1|yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room, did not
1|let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
1|conversation.
1|
1|The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess
1|Bezukhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously,
1|had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament, and
1|was said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated
1|Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to
1|some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way.
1|
1|They all knew very well that the enchanting countess' illness
1|arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at
1|the same time, and that the Italian's cure consisted in removing
1|such inconvenience; but in Anna Pavlovna's presence no one dared to
1|think of this or even appear to know it.
1|
1|"They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is
1|angina pectoris."
1|
1|"Angina? Oh, that's a terrible illness!"
1|
1|"They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina..."
1|and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.
1|
1|"The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the
1|doctor told him the case was dangerous."
1|
1|"Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman."
1|
1|"You are speaking of the poor countess?" said Anna Pavlovna,
1|coming up just then. "I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a
1|little better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the
1|world," she went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. "We belong to
1|different camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she
1|deserves. She is very unfortunate!" added Anna Pavlovna.
1|
1|Supposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting the
1|veil from the secret of the countess' malady, an unwary young man
1|ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been
1|called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan
1|who might employ dangerous remedies.
1|
1|"Your information maybe better than mine," Anna Pavlovna suddenly
1|and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, "but I know on
1|good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He
1|is private physician to the Queen of Spain."
1|
1|And having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pavlovna turned to
1|another group where Bilibin was talking about the Austrians: having
1|wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again
1|and utter one of his mots.
1|
1|"I think it is delightful," he said, referring to a diplomatic
1|note that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners
1|captured from the French by Wittgenstein, "the hero of Petropol" as he
1|was then called in Petersburg.
1|
1|"What? What's that?" asked Anna Pavlovna, securing silence for the
1|mot, which she had heard before.
1|
1|And Bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch,
1|which he had himself composed.
1|
1|"The Emperor returns these Austrian banners," said Bilibin,
1|"friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path," and his brow
1|became smooth again.
1|
1|"Charming, charming!" observed Prince Vasili.
1|
1|"The path to Warsaw, perhaps," Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly
1|and unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he
1|meant. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise.
1|He knew no more than the others what his words meant. During his
1|diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances
1|were received as very witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in
1|that way the first words that entered his head. "It may turn out
1|very well," he thought, "but if not, they'll know how to arrange
1|matters." And really, during the awkward silence that ensued, that
1|insufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been
1|waiting for and wished to convert, and she, smiling and shaking a
1|finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince Vasili to the table and bringing
1|him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone
1|became silent.
1|
1|
1|"Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!" Prince Vasili sternly
1|declaimed, looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether
1|anyone had anything to say to the contrary. But no one said
1|anything. "Moscow, our ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives
1|her Christ"--he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her--"as a mother
1|receives her zealous sons into her arms, and through the gathering
1|mists, foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule, sings in
1|exultation, 'Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh!'"
1|
1|
1|Prince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.
1|
1|Bilibin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present
1|appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna
1|Pavlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman
1|muttering the prayer at Communion: "Let the bold and insolent
1|Goliath..." she whispered.
1|
1|Prince Vasili continued.
1|
1|
1|"Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France
1|encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble
1|Faith, the sling of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head
1|in his bloodthirsty pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the
1|servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country's weal, is
1|offered to Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength
1|prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence. I
1|raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race
1|of the just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty."
1|
1|
1|"What force! What a style!" was uttered in approval both of reader
1|and of author.
1|
1|Animated by that address Anna Pavlovna's guests talked for a long
1|time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as
1|to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days.
1|
1|"You will see," said Anna Pavlovna, "that tomorrow, on the Emperor's
1|birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day
1|during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor's
1|birthday, Prince Volkonski was called out of the church and received a
1|dispatch from Prince Kutuzov. It was Kutuzov's report, written from
1|Tatarinova on the day of the battle. Kutuzov wrote that the Russians
1|had not retreated a step, that the French losses were much heavier
1|than ours, and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle
1|before collecting full information. It followed that there must have
1|been a victory. And at once, without leaving the church, thanks were
1|rendered to the Creator for His help and for the victory.
1|
1|Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was justified, and all that morning a
1|joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the
1|victory to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon's
1|having been captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new
1|ruler for France.
1|
1|It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real
1|strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far
1|from the scene of action. General events involuntarily group
1|themselves around some particular incident. So now the courtiers'
1|pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on
1|the Emperor's birthday as on the fact of the victory itself. It was
1|like a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was made in Kutuzov's
1|report of the Russian losses, among which figured the names of
1|Tuchkov, Bagration, and Kutaysov. In the Petersburg world this sad
1|side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single
1|incident: Kutaysov's death. Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked him,
1|and he was young and interesting. That day everyone met with the
1|words:
1|
1|"What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a
1|loss Kutaysov is! How sorry I am!"
1|
1|"What did I tell about Kutuzov?" Prince Vasili now said with a
1|prophet's pride. "I always said he was the only man capable of
1|defeating Napoleon."
1|
1|But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood
1|grew anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the
1|suspense occasioned the Emperor.
1|
1|"Fancy the Emperor's position!" said they, and instead of
1|extolling Kutuzov as they had done the day before, they condemned
1|him as the cause of the Emperor's anxiety. That day Prince Vasili no
1|longer boasted of his protege Kutuzov, but remained silent when the
1|commander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if
1|everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy,
1|a terrible piece of news was added. Countess Helene Bezukhova had
1|suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to
1|mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone said that
1|Countess Bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris,
1|but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private
1|physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a
1|certain drug to produce a certain effect; but Helene, tortured by
1|the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom
1|she had written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied,
1|had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in
1|agony before assistance could be rendered her. It was said that Prince
1|Vasili and the old count had turned upon the Italian, but the latter
1|had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they
1|had immediately let the matter drop.
1|
1|Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor's
1|lack of news, the loss of Kutuzov, and the death of Helene.
1|
1|On the third day after Kutuzov's report a country gentleman
1|arrived from Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French
1|spread through the whole town. This was terrible! What a position
1|for the Emperor to be in! Kutuzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasili
1|during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his
1|daughter's death said of Kutuzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was
1|excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said), that it
1|was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old
1|man.
1|
1|"I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted
1|to such a man."
1|
1|As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt
1|it, but the next day the following communication was received from
1|Count Rostopchin:
1|
1|
1|Prince Kutuzov's adjutant has brought me a letter in which he
1|demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road. He
1|writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutuzov's
1|action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will
1|shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness
1|is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall
1|follow the army. I have had everything removed, and it only remains
1|for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland.
1|
1|
1|On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to
1|Kutuzov with the following rescript:
1|
1|
1|Prince Michael Ilarionovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have
1|received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I
1|received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslavl, the sad
1|news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You
1|can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your
1|silence increases my astonishment. I am sending this by
1|Adjutant-General Prince Volkonski, to hear from you the situation of
1|the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy
1|decision.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from
1|Kutuzov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that
1|event. This messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know
1|Russian, but who was quoique etranger, russe de coeur et d'ame,* as he
1|said of himself.
1|
1|
1|*Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.
1|
1|
1|The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the
1|palace on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before
1|the campaign and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as
1|he wrote) when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain*
1|with the news of the burning of Moscow, dont les flammes eclairaient
1|sa route.*[2]
1|
1|
1|*Our most gracious sovereign.
1|
1|*[2] Whose flames illumined his route.
1|
1|
1|Though the source of M. Michaud's chagrin must have been different
1|from that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when
1|shown into the Emperor's study that the latter at once asked:
1|
1|"Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?"
1|
1|"Very sad, sire," replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh.
1|"The abandonment of Moscow."
1|
1|"Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?" asked
1|the Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.
1|
1|Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutuzov had entrusted
1|to him, which was that it had been impossible to fight before
1|Moscow, and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the
1|army as well as Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal
1|had to choose the latter.
1|
1|The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.
1|
1|"Has the enemy entered the city?" he asked.
1|
1|"Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,"
1|replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he
1|was frightened by what he had done.
1|
1|The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip
1|trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.
1|
1|But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming
1|himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in
1|a firm voice:
1|
1|"I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence
1|requires great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in
1|all things to His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the
1|army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did
1|you not notice discouragement?..."
1|
1|Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also
1|grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor's
1|direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.
1|
1|"Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal
1|soldier?" he asked to gain time.
1|
1|"Colonel, I always require it," replied the Emperor. "Conceal
1|nothing from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are."
1|
1|"Sire!" said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on
1|his lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, "sire, I left
1|the whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without
1|exception in desperate and agonized terror..."
1|
1|"How is that?" the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. "Would
1|misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!"
1|
1|Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
1|prepared.
1|
1|"Sire," he said, with respectful playfulness, "they are only
1|afraid lest Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should
1|allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the
1|combat," declared this representative of the Russian nation, "and to
1|prove to Your Majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they
1|are...."
1|
1|"Ah!" said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his
1|eyes, he patted Michaud on the shoulder. "You set me at ease,
1|Colonel."
1|
1|He bent his head and was silent for some time.
1|
1|"Well, then, go back to the army," he said, drawing himself up to
1|his full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic
1|gesture, "and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you
1|go that when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the
1|head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last
1|resources of my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies
1|suppose," said the Emperor growing more and more animated; "but should
1|it ever be ordained by Divine Providence," he continued, raising to
1|heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion, "that my dynasty should
1|cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting
1|all the means at my command, I shall let my beard grow to here" (he
1|pointed halfway down his chest) "and go and eat potatoes with the
1|meanest of my peasants, rather than sign the disgrace of my country
1|and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to appreciate."
1|
1|Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly
1|turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his
1|eyes, and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a
1|few moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the
1|elbow with a vigorous movement. The Emperor's mild and handsome face
1|was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.
1|
1|"Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we
1|may recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I," said the
1|Emperor, touching his breast. "We can no longer both reign together. I
1|have learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more...."
1|
1|And the Emperor paused, with a frown.
1|
1|When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm
1|resolution in the Emperor's eyes, Michaud--quoique etranger, russe
1|de coeur et d'ame--at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by
1|all that he had heard (as he used afterwards to say), and gave
1|expression to his own feelings and those of the Russian people whose
1|representative he considered himself to be, in the following words:
1|
1|"Sire!" said he, "Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory
1|of the nation and the salvation of Europe!"
1|
1|With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine
1|that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were
1|fleeing to distant provinces, and one levy after another was being
1|raised for the defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the
1|greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves,
1|saving their fatherland, or weeping over its downfall. The tales and
1|descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the
1|self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, and the heroism of
1|the Russians. But it was not really so. It appears so to us because we
1|see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all
1|the personal human interests that people had. Yet in reality those
1|personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general
1|interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt
1|or even noticed. Most of the people at that time paid no attention
1|to the general progress of events but were guided only by their
1|private interests, and they were the very people whose activities at
1|that period were most useful.
1|
1|Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to
1|take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless
1|members of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they
1|did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish--like
1|Pierre's and Mamonov's regiments which looted Russian villages, and
1|the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded,
1|and so on. Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing
1|their feelings, who discussed Russia's position at the time
1|involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of
1|pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed
1|against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty
1|of. In historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of
1|the Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable. Only unconscious action
1|bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never
1|understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts
1|are fruitless.
1|
1|The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place
1|in Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg
1|and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and
1|gentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital
1|and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which
1|retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow,
1|and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be
1|avenged on the French, but they thought about their next pay, their
1|next quarters, of Matreshka the vivandiere, and like matters.
1|
1|As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostov took a
1|close and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so
1|casually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked
1|at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally
1|racking his brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the
1|state of Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to
1|think about it, that Kutuzov and others were there for that purpose,
1|but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their
1|full strength, that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet,
1|and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of
1|a regiment in a couple of years' time.
1|
1|As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being
1|sent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without
1|regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but
1|with the greatest pleasure--which he did not conceal and which his
1|comrades fully understood.
1|
1|A few days before the battle of Borodino, Nicholas received the
1|necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in
1|advance, he set out with post horses for Voronezh.
1|
1|Only a man who has experienced it--that is, has passed some months
1|continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war--can understand
1|the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by
1|the army's foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals.
1|When--free from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp--he
1|saw villages with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen's country
1|houses, fields where cattle were grazing, posthouses with
1|stationmasters asleep in them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this
1|for the first time. What for a long while specially surprised and
1|delighted him were the women, young and healthy, without a dozen
1|officers making up to each of them; women, too, who were pleased and
1|flattered that a passing officer should joke with them.
1|
1|In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in
1|Voronezh, ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and
1|next day, very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not
1|worn for a long time, went to present himself to the authorities.
1|
1|The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man
1|who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He
1|received Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically
1|military) and questioned him with an important air, as if
1|considering the general progress of affairs and approving and
1|disapproving with full right to do so. Nicholas was in such good
1|spirits that this merely amused him.
1|
1|From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The
1|governor was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated
1|the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended
1|to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out
1|of town who had the best horses, and promised to assist him in every
1|way.
1|
1|"You are Count Ilya Rostov's son? My wife was a great friend of your
1|mother's. We are at home on Thursdays--today is Thursday, so please
1|come and see us quite informally," said the governor, taking leave
1|of him.
1|
1|Immediately on leaving the governor's, Nicholas hired post horses
1|and, taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop
1|to the landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything
1|seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay
1|in Voronezh and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant
1|state of mind, everything went well and easily.
1|
1|The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old
1|cavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some
1|century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery
1|where he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses.
1|
1|In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
1|thousand rubles--to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.
1|After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine,
1|Nicholas--having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was
1|already on the friendliest terms--galloped back over abominable roads,
1|in the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as
1|to be in time for the governor's party.
1|
1|When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented
1|himself, Nicholas arrived at the governor's rather late, but with
1|the phrase "better late than never" on his lips.
1|
1|It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew
1|that Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the
1|clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come
1|as to a ball.
1|
1|Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this
1|difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
1|arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything
1|that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was
1|noticeable, an "in for a penny, in for a pound--who cares?" spirit,
1|and the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and
1|mutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.
1|
1|The society gathered together at the governor's was the best in
1|Voronezh.
1|
1|There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas' Moscow
1|acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the
1|cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured
1|and well-bred Count Rostov. Among the men was an Italian prisoner,
1|an officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence
1|of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The
1|Italian was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed
1|to him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he
1|treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint.
1|
1|As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing
1|around him a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the
1|words "better late than never" and heard them repeated several times
1|by others, people clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he
1|felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the
1|province--that of a universal favorite: a very pleasant position,
1|and intoxicatingly so after his long privations. At posting
1|stations, at inns, and in the landowner's snuggery, maidservants had
1|been flattered by his notice, and here too at the governor's party
1|there were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible number of
1|pretty young women, married and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his
1|notice. The women and girls flirted with him and, from the first
1|day, the people concerned themselves to get this fine young
1|daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these was the
1|governor's wife herself, who welcomed Rostov as a near relative and
1|called him "Nicholas."
1|
1|Catherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise, and
1|dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the
1|provincial society by his agility. His particularly free manner of
1|dancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised
1|at the way he danced that evening. He had never danced like that in
1|Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner
1|improper and in bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to
1|astonish them all by something unusual, something they would have to
1|accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the
1|provinces.
1|
1|All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and
1|pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.
1|With the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other
1|men's wives were created for them, Rostov did not leave the lady's
1|side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style,
1|as if, without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and
1|the lady would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem
1|to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov. But
1|the latter's good-natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even
1|he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas' good humor. Toward the end of
1|the evening, however, as the wife's face grew more flushed and
1|animated, the husband's became more and more melancholy and solemn, as
1|though there were but a given amount of animation between them and
1|as the wife's share increased the husband's diminished.

1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending
1|closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments
1|with a smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the
1|position of his legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor
1|of perfume, and admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines
1|of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the
1|blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in
1|Voronezh.
1|
1|"Which lady?"
1|
1|"A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes" (Nicholas looked at his
1|partner) "are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure" (he glanced
1|at her shoulders) "like Diana's...."
1|
1|The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
1|about.
1|
1|"Ah, Nikita Ivanych!" cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if
1|wishing Nikita Ivanych to share his joke, he began to tell him of
1|his intention to elope with a blonde lady.
1|
1|The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor's
1|good-natured wife came up with a look of disapproval.
1|
1|"Anna Ignatyevna wants to see you, Nicholas," said she,
1|pronouncing the name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna
1|Ignatyevna was a very important person. "Come, Nicholas! You know
1|you let me call you so?"
1|
1|"Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?"
1|
1|"Anna Ignatyevna Malvintseva. She has heard from her niece how you
1|rescued her... Can you guess?"
1|
1|"I rescued such a lot of them!" said Nicholas.
1|
1|"Her niece, Princess Bolkonskaya. She is here in Voronezh with her
1|aunt. Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?"
1|
1|"Not a bit! Please don't, Aunt!"
1|
1|"Very well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!"
1|
1|The governor's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady
1|with a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with
1|the most important personages of the town. This was Malvintseva,
1|Princess Mary's aunt on her mother's side, a rich, childless widow who
1|always lived in Voronezh. When Rostov approached her she was
1|standing settling up for the game. She looked at him and, screwing
1|up her eyes sternly, continued to upbraid the general who had won from
1|her.
1|
1|"Very pleased, mon cher," she then said, holding out her hand to
1|Nicholas. "Pray come and see me."
1|
1|After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom
1|Malvintseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas
1|knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the
1|important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation
1|to come to see her.
1|
1|Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the
1|mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and
1|even of fear, which he himself did not understand.
1|
1|When he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the
1|dancing, but the governor's little wife placed her plump hand on his
1|sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to
1|her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew
1|so as not to be in her way.
1|
1|"Do you know, dear boy," began the governor's wife with a serious
1|expression on her kind little face, "that really would be the match
1|for you: would you like me to arrange it?"
1|
1|"Whom do you mean, Aunt?" asked Nicholas.
1|
1|"I will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petrovna
1|speaks of Lily, but I say, no--the princess! Do you want me to do
1|it? I am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl
1|she is, really! And she is not at all so plain, either."
1|
1|"Not at all," replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. "As
1|befits a soldier, Aunt, I don't force myself on anyone or refuse
1|anything," he said before he had time to consider what he was saying.
1|
1|"Well then, remember, this is not a joke!"
1|
1|"Of course not!"
1|
1|"Yes, yes," the governor's wife said as if talking to herself. "But,
1|my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other,
1|the blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really...."
1|
1|"Oh no, we are good friends with him," said Nicholas in the
1|simplicity of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so
1|pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else.
1|
1|"But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor's wife!"
1|thought Nicholas suddenly at supper. "She will really begin to arrange
1|a match... and Sonya...?" And on taking leave of the governor's
1|wife, when she again smilingly said to him, "Well then, remember!"
1|he drew her aside.
1|
1|"But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt..."
1|
1|"What is it, my dear? Come, let's sit down here," said she.
1|
1|Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
1|thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or
1|his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he
1|afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable
1|frankness which had very important results for him, it seemed to
1|him--as it seems to everyone in such cases--that it was merely some
1|silly whim that seized him: yet that burst of frankness, together with
1|other trifling events, had immense consequences for him and for all
1|his family.
1|
1|"You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but
1|the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me."
1|
1|"Oh yes, I understand," said the governor's wife.
1|
1|"But Princess Bolkonskaya--that's another matter. I will tell you
1|the truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to
1|her; and then, after I met her under such circumstances--so strangely,
1|the idea often occurred to me: 'This is fate.' Especially if you
1|remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never
1|happened to meet her before, somehow it had always happened that we
1|did not meet. And as long as my sister Natasha was engaged to her
1|brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of
1|marrying her. And it must needs happen that I should meet her just
1|when Natasha's engagement had been broken off... and then
1|everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone and never
1|will, only to you."
1|
1|The governor's wife pressed his elbow gratefully.
1|
1|"You know Sonya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her,
1|and will do so.... So you see there can be no question about-" said
1|Nicholas incoherently and blushing.
1|
1|"My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sonya has nothing
1|and you yourself say your Papa's affairs are in a very bad way. And
1|what about your mother? It would kill her, that's one thing. And
1|what sort of life would it be for Sonya--if she's a girl with a heart?
1|Your mother in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and
1|Sonya ought to understand that."
1|
1|Nicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.
1|
1|"All the same, Aunt, it is impossible," he rejoined with a sigh,
1|after a short pause. "Besides, would the princess have me? And
1|besides, she is now in mourning. How can one think of it!"
1|
1|"But you don't suppose I'm going to get you married at once? There
1|is always a right way of doing things," replied the governor's wife.
1|
1|"What a matchmaker you are, Aunt..." said Nicholas, kissing her
1|plump little hand.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostov, Princess Mary
1|had found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince
1|Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvintseva at
1|Voronezh. That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her
1|during her father's illness, since his death, and especially since her
1|meeting with Rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey,
1|anxiety about her brother, settling in a new house, meeting new
1|people, and attending to her nephew's education. She was sad. Now,
1|after a month passed in quiet surroundings, she felt more and more
1|deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with
1|the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly tortured by the
1|thought of the dangers to which her brother, the only intimate
1|person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was worried too about
1|her nephew's education for which she had always felt herself
1|incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace--a
1|peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal
1|dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her
1|and were related to her meeting with Rostov.
1|
1|The day after her party the governor's wife came to see
1|Malvintseva and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked
1|that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of
1|course, not to be thought of, all the same the young people might be
1|brought together and could get to know one another. Malvintseva
1|expressed approval, and the governor's wife began to speak of Rostov
1|in Mary's presence, praising him and telling how he had blushed when
1|Princess Mary's name was mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a
1|painful rather than a joyful feeling--her mental tranquillity was
1|destroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.
1|
1|During the two days that elapsed before Rostov called, Princess Mary
1|continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she
1|decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her
1|aunt--that it would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to
1|receive visitors; then she thought this would be rude after what he
1|had done for her; then it occurred to her that her aunt and the
1|governor's wife had intentions concerning herself and Rostov--their
1|looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition--then
1|she told herself that only she, with her sinful nature, could think
1|this of them: they could not forget that situated as she was, while
1|still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking would be an insult to
1|her and to her father's memory. Assuming that she did go down to see
1|him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she
1|would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold
1|and then to mean too much. More than anything she feared lest the
1|confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she
1|saw him.
1|
1|But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
1|room that Count Rostov had called, the princess showed no confusion,
1|only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
1|and radiant light.
1|
1|"You have met him, Aunt?" said she in a calm voice, unable herself
1|to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.
1|
1|When Rostov entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an
1|instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then
1|just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look
1|with shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she
1|half rose with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate
1|hand to him, and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time
1|new deep womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in
1|the drawing room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise.
1|Herself a consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on
1|meeting a man she wished to attract.
1|
1|"Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has
1|greatly improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what
1|tact and grace!" thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.
1|
1|Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she
1|would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the
1|change that had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized
1|that dear, loved face, a new life force took possession of her and
1|compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will. From the
1|time Rostov entered, her face became suddenly transformed. It was as
1|if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the
1|intricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, that previously
1|seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly shown up in
1|unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time all that pure,
1|spiritual, inward travail through which she had lived appeared on
1|the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction with herself,
1|her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her meekness, love,
1|and self-sacrifice--all this now shone in those radiant eyes, in her
1|delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.
1|
1|Rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He
1|felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better
1|than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.
1|
1|Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of
1|the war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow
1|about it; they spoke of their last meeting--Nicholas trying to
1|change the subject--they talked of the governor's kind wife, of
1|Nicholas' relations, and of Princess Mary's.
1|
1|She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as
1|soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of
1|Russia's misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was
1|too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of
1|him. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess
1|Mary's character with an observation unusual to him, and everything
1|confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and
1|extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people
1|spoke to him about the princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and
1|even when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt quite at
1|ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite
1|appropriately, occurred to him at the moment.
1|
1|When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is
1|usual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew's little son,
1|caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He
1|took the boy on his knee, played with him, and looked round at
1|Princess Mary. With a softened, happy, timid look she watched the
1|boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved. Nicholas also
1|noticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed with pleasure
1|and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness.
1|
1|As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society,
1|and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but
1|all the same the governor's wife went on with her matchmaking, passing
1|on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and
1|vice versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary.
1|For this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at
1|the bishop's house before Mass.
1|
1|Though Rostov told the governor's wife that he would not make any
1|declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.
1|
1|As at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what
1|everybody considered right was right, so now, after a short but
1|sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own
1|sense of justice, and in obedient submission to circumstances, he
1|chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly
1|carrying him he knew not where. He knew that after his promise to
1|Sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to
1|Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely. But he also
1|knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that by resigning
1|himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were
1|guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing
1|something very important--more important than anything he had ever
1|done in his life.
1|
1|After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on
1|externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for
1|him and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her
1|as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he
1|had met in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time
1|rapturously, thought about Sonya. He had pictured each of those
1|young ladies as almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as
1|a possible wife, adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions
1|of married life: a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his
1|wife's carriage, little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to
1|her, and so on--and these pictures of the future had given him
1|pleasure. But with Princess Mary, to whom they were trying to get
1|him engaged, he could never picture anything of future married life.
1|If he tried, his pictures seemed incongruous and false. It made him
1|afraid.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|The dreadful news of the battle of Borodino, of our losses in killed
1|and wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow
1|reached Voronezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having
1|learned of her brother's wound only from the Gazette and having no
1|definite news of him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her
1|again himself) to set off in search of Prince Andrew.
1|
1|When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the
1|abandonment of Moscow, Rostov was not seized with despair, anger,
1|the desire for vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but
1|everything in Voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and
1|he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The
1|conversations he heard seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to
1|judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would
1|everything again become clear to him. He made haste to finish buying
1|the horses, and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and
1|squadron quartermaster.
1|
1|A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which
1|Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian
1|victory. He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with
1|military decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of
1|subjects. When the service was over the governor's wife beckoned him
1|to her.
1|
1|"Have you seen the princess?" she asked, indicating with a
1|movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond
1|the choir.
1|
1|Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the
1|profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude,
1|timidity, and pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary,
1|evidently engrossed by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last
1|time before leaving the church.
1|
1|Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he
1|had seen before, there was the same general expression of refined,
1|inner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There
1|was a pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had
1|occurred before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her
1|without waiting to be prompted by the governor's wife and not asking
1|himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here
1|in church, and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized
1|with his whole soul. As soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow
1|kindled in her face, lighting up both her sorrow and her joy.
1|
1|"There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess," said Rostov.
1|"It is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikolievich, were not
1|living, it would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he
1|is a colonel."
1|
1|The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but
1|cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.
1|
1|"And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound" (the Gazette
1|said it was a shell) "either proving fatal at once or being very
1|slight," continued Nicholas. "We must hope for the best, and I am
1|sure..."
1|
1|Princess Mary interrupted him.
1|
1|"Oh, that would be so dread..." she began and, prevented by
1|agitation from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as
1|graceful as everything she did in his presence and, looking up at
1|him gratefully, went out, following her aunt.
1|
1|That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle
1|some accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that
1|business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to
1|go to bed, and for a long time he paced up and down the room,
1|reflecting on his life, a thing he rarely did.
1|
1|Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had
1|met her in Smolensk province. His having encountered her in such
1|exceptional circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned
1|her to him as a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her.
1|When he met her again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was
1|not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the
1|peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was,
1|however, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to
1|regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her.
1|But that day's encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than
1|was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face,
1|that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially
1|the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated
1|him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostov could not bear to see the
1|expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like
1|Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
1|and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed
1|the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an
1|irresistible attraction.
1|
1|"She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!" he said to himself.
1|"Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya?" And he
1|involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one
1|and the abundance of it in the other--a spirituality he himself lacked
1|and therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would
1|happen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would
1|become his wife. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed,
1|and no clear picture presented itself to his mind. He had long ago
1|pictured to himself a future with Sonya, and that was all clear and
1|simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all
1|there was in Sonya, but it was impossible to picture a future with
1|Princess Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.
1|
1|Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them,
1|but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little
1|frightening.
1|
1|"How she prayed!" he thought. "It was plain that her whole soul
1|was in her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains,
1|and I am sure her prayer will be answered. Why don't I pray for what I
1|want?" he suddenly thought. "What do I want? To be free, released from
1|Sonya... She was right," he thought, remembering what the governor's
1|wife had said: "Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya.
1|Muddles, grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible
1|muddles! Besides, I don't love her--not as I should. O, God! release
1|me from this dreadful, inextricable position!" he suddenly began to
1|pray. "Yes, prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not
1|pray as Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn
1|into sugar--and then run out into the yard to see whether it had
1|done so. No, but I am not praying for trifles now," he thought as he
1|put his pipe down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself
1|before the icon. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to
1|pray as he had not done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in
1|his throat when the door opened and Lavrushka came in with some
1|papers.
1|
1|"Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?" cried
1|Nicholas, quickly changing his attitude.
1|
1|"From the governor," said Lavrushka in a sleepy voice. "A courier
1|has arrived and there's a letter for you."
1|
1|"Well, all right, thanks. You can go!"
1|
1|Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother
1|and the other from Sonya. He recognized them by the handwriting and
1|opened Sonya's first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale
1|and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy.
1|
1|"No, it's not possible!" he cried aloud.
1|
1|Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter
1|and reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then
1|again, and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his
1|shoulders, stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and
1|his eyes fixed. What he had just been praying for with confidence that
1|God would hear him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much
1|astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected, and
1|as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had
1|not come from God to whom he had prayed, but by some ordinary
1|coincidence.
1|
1|This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary
1|letter from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from
1|which there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last
1|unfortunate events--the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs'
1|Moscow property--and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that
1|Nicholas should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his
1|silence and coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide to
1|release him from his promise and set him completely free.
1|
1|
1|It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of
1|sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she
1|wrote), and my love has no aim but the happiness of those I love;
1|so, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured
1|that, in spite of everything, no one can love you more than does
1|
1|Your Sonya
1|
1|
1|Both letters were written from Troitsa. The other, from the
1|countess, described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the
1|fire, and the destruction of all their property. In this letter the
1|countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded
1|traveling with them; his state was very critical, but the doctor
1|said there was now more hope. Sonya and Natasha were nursing him.
1|
1|Next day Nicholas took his mother's letter and went to see
1|Princess Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what "Natasha
1|nursing him" might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly
1|became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations.
1|
1|The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to
1|Yaroslavl, and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.

1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|Sonya's letter written from Troitsa, which had come as an answer
1|to Nicholas' prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting
1|Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess' mind more
1|and more. She knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle to this
1|happening, and Sonya's life in the countess' house had grown harder
1|and harder, especially after they had received a letter from
1|Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Bogucharovo. The
1|countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions
1|to Sonya.
1|
1|But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all
1|that was going on, she called Sonya to her and, instead of reproaching
1|and making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself
1|and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
1|engagement with Nicholas.
1|
1|"I shall not be at peace till you promise me this."
1|
1|Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs
1|that she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave
1|no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was
1|demanded of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had
1|reared and brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya's
1|habit. Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could
1|she show her worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it.
1|But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily
1|conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of
1|others, and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more
1|than anything in the world. But now they wanted her to sacrifice the
1|very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice
1|and the whole meaning of her life. And for the first time she felt
1|bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to
1|torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous of Natasha who had
1|never experienced anything of this sort, had never needed to sacrifice
1|herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was
1|beloved by everybody. And for the first time Sonya felt that out of
1|her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning
1|to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue, or religion.
1|Under the influence of this feeling Sonya, whose life of dependence
1|had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered the
1|countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and resolved
1|to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but
1|on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.
1|
1|The bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last days in Moscow stifled
1|the gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find
1|escape from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince
1|Andrew's presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and
1|for Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that
1|God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that
1|Natasha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love
1|him. She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible
1|circumstances they would again fall in love with one another, and that
1|Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would
1|be within the prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror
1|of what had happened during those last days and during the first
1|days of their journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in
1|her personal affairs cheered Sonya.
1|
1|At the Troitsa monastery the Rostovs first broke their journey for a
1|whole day.
1|
1|Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry,
1|one of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much
1|better that day and Natasha was sitting with him. In the next room sat
1|the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was
1|calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.
1|Sonya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew
1|and Natasha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices
1|through the door. That door opened and Natasha came out, looking
1|excited. Not noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was
1|drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sonya
1|and took her hand.
1|
1|"Natasha, what are you about? Come here!" said the countess.
1|
1|Natasha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to
1|pray for aid to God and His saint.
1|
1|As soon as the prior withdrew, Natasha took her friend by the hand
1|and went with her into the unoccupied room.
1|
1|"Sonya, will he live?" she asked. "Sonya, how happy I am, and how
1|unhappy!... Sonya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he
1|lives! He cannot... because... because... of" and Natasha burst into
1|tears.
1|
1|"Yes! I knew it! Thank God!" murmured Sonya. "He will live."
1|
1|Sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's fear and
1|grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.
1|Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natasha. "If only he lives!" she
1|thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two
1|friends went together to Prince Andrew's door. Natasha opened it
1|cautiously and glanced into the room, Sonya standing beside her at the
1|half-open door.
1|
1|Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale
1|face was calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular
1|breathing.
1|
1|"O, Natasha!" Sonya suddenly almost screamed, catching her
1|companion's arm and stepping back from the door.
1|
1|"What? What is it?" asked Natasha.
1|
1|"It's that, that..." said Sonya, with a white face and trembling
1|lips.
1|
1|Natasha softly closed the door and went with Sonya to the window,
1|not yet understanding what the latter was telling her.
1|
1|"You remember," said Sonya with a solemn and frightened
1|expression. "You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at
1|Otradnoe at Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?"
1|
1|"Yes, yes!" cried Natasha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely
1|recalling that Sonya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom
1|she had seen lying down.
1|
1|"You remember?" Sonya went on. "I saw it then and told everybody,
1|you and Dunyasha. I saw him lying on a bed," said she, making a
1|gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, "and that he
1|had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that
1|his hands were folded," she concluded, convincing herself that the
1|details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the
1|mirror.
1|
1|She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first
1|thing that came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed
1|to her now as real as any other recollection. She not only
1|remembered what she had then said--that he turned to look at her and
1|smiled and was covered with something red--but was firmly convinced
1|that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink
1|quilt and that his eyes were closed.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, it really was pink!" cried Natasha, who now thought she
1|too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most
1|extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.
1|
1|"But what does it mean?" she added meditatively.
1|
1|"Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange," replied Sonya, clutching
1|at her head.
1|
1|A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natasha went to him,
1|but Sonya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the
1|window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.
1|
1|
1|They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and
1|the countess was writing to her son.
1|
1|"Sonya!" said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as
1|her niece passed, "Sonya, won't you write to Nicholas?" She spoke in a
1|soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her
1|spectacles Sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these
1|words. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear
1|of a refusal, and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such
1|refusal.
1|
1|Sonya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.
1|
1|"Yes, Mamma, I will write," said she.
1|
1|Sonya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred
1|that day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen
1|of her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha's
1|relations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying
1|Princess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a return of that
1|self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and
1|loved to live. So with a joyful consciousness of performing a
1|magnanimous deed--interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed
1|her velvety black eyes--she wrote that touching letter the arrival
1|of which had so amazed Nicholas.
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with
1|hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was
1|taken. In their attitude toward him could still be felt both
1|uncertainty as to who he might be--perhaps a very important
1|person--and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict
1|with him.
1|
1|But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for
1|the new guard--both officers and men--he was not as interesting as
1|he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day
1|did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the
1|vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and
1|the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child;
1|they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and
1|detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they
1|noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed,
1|meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke
1|French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he
1|was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the
1|separate room he had occupied was required by an officer.
1|
1|All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class
1|and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more
1|especially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them
1|making fun of him.
1|
1|That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably,
1|among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was
1|taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white
1|mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on
1|their arms. With the precision and definiteness customary in
1|addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude human frailty,
1|Pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was, where he had
1|been, with what object, and so on.
1|
1|These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the
1|essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that
1|essence's being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel
1|through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow
1|so as to lead to the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as
1|Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim, the
1|channel was removed and the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt,
1|moreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, perplexity as
1|to why these questions were put to him. He had a feeling that it was
1|only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of
1|placing a channel was employed. He knew he was in these men's power,
1|that only by force had they brought him there, that force alone gave
1|them the right to demand answers to their questions, and that the sole
1|object of that assembly was to inculpate him. And so, as they had
1|the power and wish to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry
1|and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would
1|lead to conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was arrested,
1|Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to
1|its parents a child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought
1|the marauder? Pierre answered that he "was protecting a woman," and
1|that "to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of
1|every man; that..." They interrupted him, for this was not to the
1|point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had
1|seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in
1|Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked where he was
1|going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they asked,
1|repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer. Again
1|he replied that he could not answer it.
1|
1|"Put that down, that's bad... very bad," sternly remarked the
1|general with the white mustache and red flushed face.
1|
1|
1|On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski rampart.
1|
1|Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a
1|merchant's house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the
1|streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the
1|whole city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize
1|the significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires
1|with horror.
1|
1|He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and
1|during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that
1|all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any
1|day from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn
1|from the soldiers. Evidently for them "the marshal" represented a very
1|high and rather mysterious power.
1|
1|These first days, before the eighth of September when the
1|prisoners were had up for a second examination, were the hardest of
1|all for Pierre.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|On the eighth of September an officer--a very important one
1|judging by the respect the guards showed him--entered the coach
1|house where the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on
1|the staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the
1|Russians there, naming Pierre as "the man who does not give his name."
1|Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered
1|the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up
1|before taking them to the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers
1|arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin's Field.
1|It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure.
1|The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken
1|from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart, but rose through the pure
1|air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose on
1|all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast
1|charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves
1|and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the blackened
1|walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not
1|recognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see
1|churches that had not been burned. The Kremlin, which was not
1|destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the
1|belfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin
1|glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.
1|These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the
1|Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate
1|this holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to
1|be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when
1|they saw the French.
1|
1|It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but
1|in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed,
1|Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order
1|had been established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the
1|looks of the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and
1|gaily, were escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the
1|looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by
1|a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of
1|regimental music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt
1|and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French
1|officer had read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been
1|taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to
1|another place with dozens of other men, and it seemed that they
1|might have forgotten him, or confused him with the others. But no: the
1|answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his
1|designation as "the man who does not give his name," and under that
1|appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were now leading
1|him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and
1|all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that
1|they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be
1|an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose
1|action he did not understand but which was working well.
1|
1|He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the
1|Virgin's Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not
1|far from the convent. This was Prince Shcherbitov's house, where
1|Pierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned from the
1|talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of
1|Eckmuhl (Davout).
1|
1|They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.
1|Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass
1|gallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a
1|long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant.
1|
1|Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end
1|of the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently
1|consulting a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without
1|raising his eyes, he said in a low voice:
1|
1|"Who are you?"
1|
1|Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To
1|him Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for
1|his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern
1|schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre
1|felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did
1|not know what to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at
1|his first examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was
1|dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had
1|decided what to do, Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back
1|on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.
1|
1|"I know that man," he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently
1|calculated to frighten Pierre.
1|
1|The chill that had been running down Pierre's back now seized his
1|head as in a vise.
1|
1|"You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you..."
1|
1|"He is a Russian spy," Davout interrupted, addressing another
1|general who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.
1|
1|Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice
1|Pierre rapidly began:
1|
1|"No, monseigneur," he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a
1|duke. "No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia
1|officer and have not quitted Moscow."
1|
1|"Your name?" asked Davout.
1|
1|"Bezukhov."
1|
1|"What proof have I that you are not lying?"
1|
1|"Monseigneur!" exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a
1|pleading voice.
1|
1|Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they
1|looked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from
1|conditions of war and law, that look established human relations
1|between the two men. At that moment an immense number of things passed
1|dimly through both their minds, and they realized that they were
1|both children of humanity and were brothers.
1|
1|At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the
1|papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre
1|was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without
1|burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a
1|human being. He reflected for a moment.
1|
1|"How can you show me that you are telling the truth?" said Davout
1|coldly.
1|
1|Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the
1|street where the house was.
1|
1|"You are not what you say," returned Davout.
1|
1|In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of
1|the truth of his statements.
1|
1|But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to
1|Davout.
1|
1|Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began
1|buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten
1|Pierre.
1|
1|When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head
1|in Pierre's direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But
1|where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach
1|house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to
1|him as they crossed the Virgin's Field.
1|
1|He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
1|question to Davout.
1|
1|"Yes, of course!" replied Davout, but what this "yes" meant,
1|Pierre did not know.
1|
1|Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was
1|far, or in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was
1|stupefied, and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs
1|as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only
1|thought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had really
1|sentenced him to death? Not the men on the commission that had first
1|examined him--not one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done
1|it. It was not Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In
1|another moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong, but
1|just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. The
1|adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might
1|have refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing
1|him, depriving him of life--him, Pierre, with all his memories,
1|aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre
1|felt that it was no one.
1|
1|It was a system--a concurrence of circumstances.
1|
1|A system of some sort was killing him--Pierre--depriving him of
1|life, of everything, annihilating him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|From Prince Shcherbatov's house the prisoners were led straight down
1|the Virgin's Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen
1|garden in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit
1|had been dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large
1|crowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and
1|many of Napoleon's soldiers who were not on duty--Germans, Italians,
1|and Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of
1|the post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red
1|epaulets and high boots and shakos.
1|
1|The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the
1|list (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums
1|suddenly began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre
1|felt as if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of
1|thinking or understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only
1|one wish--that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen
1|quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized
1|them.
1|
1|The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and
1|thin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The
1|third was a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled
1|hair and a plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a
1|very handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes.
1|The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen
1|in a loose coat.
1|
1|Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them
1|separately or two at a time. "In couples," replied the officer in
1|command in a calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers
1|and it was evident that they were all hurrying--not as men hurry to do
1|something they understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary
1|but unpleasant and incomprehensible task.
1|
1|A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of
1|prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.
1|
1|Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the
1|officer's command took the two convicts who stood first in the row.
1|The convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks
1|were being brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at
1|an approaching huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other
1|scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile.
1|With hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks
1|over their heads, and bound them to the post.
1|
1|Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a
1|firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned
1|away to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling,
1|rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most
1|terrific thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the
1|Frenchmen were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and
1|trembling hands. Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and
1|with similar looks, these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with
1|only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes, evidently unable to
1|understand or believe what was going to happen to them. They could not
1|believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them,
1|and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken
1|from them.
1|
1|Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again
1|the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the
1|same moment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the
1|Frenchmen who were again doing something by the post, their
1|trembling hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily,
1|looked around as if asking what it meant. The same question was
1|expressed in all the looks that met his.
1|
1|On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and
1|officers without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and
1|conflict that were in his own heart. "But who, after all, is doing
1|this? They are all suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?" flashed
1|for an instant through his mind.
1|
1|"Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!" shouted someone. The fifth
1|prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away--alone. Pierre did
1|not understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been
1|brought there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror,
1|and no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place.
1|The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment
1|they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at
1|Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook himself free.) The lad was
1|unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding him up under the arms,
1|and he screamed. When they got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he
1|suddenly understood something. Whether he understood that screaming
1|was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill
1|him, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be
1|blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around
1|him with glittering eyes.
1|
1|Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His
1|curiosity and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the
1|highest pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man
1|seemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare
1|foot with the other.
1|
1|When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot
1|which hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against
1|the bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in
1|that position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned
1|back again more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and
1|did not miss his slightest movement.
1|
1|Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports
1|of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards
1|remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw
1|how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how
1|blood showed itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the
1|weight of the hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head
1|hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the
1|post. No one hindered him. Pale, frightened people were doing
1|something around the workman. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a
1|thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The body collapsed.
1|The soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it
1|into the pit.
1|
1|They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who
1|must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.
1|
1|Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying
1|with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the
1|other. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively,
1|but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole
1|body. One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and
1|angrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand him and
1|remained near the post, and no one drove him away.
1|
1|When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was
1|taken back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the
1|post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The
1|twenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the
1|center of the circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed
1|by.
1|
1|Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
1|couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies.
1|This one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed
1|back, and his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit
1|at the spot from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man,
1|taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling. An
1|old, noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by
1|the elbow dragged him to his company. The crowd of Russians and
1|Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away silently and with
1|drooping heads.
1|
1|"That will teach them to start fires," said one of the Frenchmen.
1|
1|Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier
1|who was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was
1|not able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he
1|made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the
1|prisoners and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.
1|
1|Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers
1|and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the
1|barracks for the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said
1|to him, Pierre got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the
1|upper end of the field, where there were some sheds built of charred
1|planks, beams, and battens, and led him into one of them. In the
1|darkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at
1|them without understanding who they were, why they were there, or what
1|they wanted of him. He heard what they said, but did not understand
1|the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or
1|application of them. He replied to questions they put to him, but
1|did not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they
1|would understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but
1|they all seemed to him equally meaningless.
1|
1|From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders
1|committed by men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the
1|mainspring of his life, on which everything depended and which made
1|everything appear alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything
1|had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not
1|acknowledge it to himself, his faith in the right ordering of the
1|universe, in humanity, in his own soul, and in God, had been
1|destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never so strongly as
1|now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had been the
1|result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he had
1|felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be
1|found within himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled
1|before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by
1|any fault of his own. He felt that it was not in his power to regain
1|faith in the meaning of life.
1|
1|Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
1|about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and
1|asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he
1|found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing
1|and talking on all sides.
1|
1|"Well, then, mates... that very prince who..." some voice at the
1|other end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word
1|who.
1|
1|Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,
1|Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon
1|as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory
1|lad--especially dreadful because of its simplicity--and the faces of
1|the murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he
1|opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around
1|him.
1|
1|Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose
1|presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration
1|which came from him every time he moved. This man was doing
1|something to his legs in the darkness, and though Pierre could not see
1|his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him. On growing
1|used to the darkness Pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg
1|bands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre's interest.
1|
1|Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he
1|carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg,
1|glancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the
1|other was already unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way,
1|having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his
1|arm following one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg
1|bands up on some pegs fixed above his head. Then he took out a
1|knife, cut something, closed the knife, placed it under the head of
1|his bed, and, seating himself comfortably, clasped his arms round
1|his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was
1|conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well rounded in these
1|deft movements, in the man's well-ordered arrangements in his
1|corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without
1|taking his eyes from him.
1|
1|"You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?" the little man suddenly
1|said.
1|
1|And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong
1|voice that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt
1|tears rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time
1|to betray his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant
1|tones:
1|
1|"Eh, lad, don't fret!" said he, in the tender singsong caressing
1|voice old Russian peasant women employ. "Don't fret, friend--'suffer
1|an hour, live for an age!' that's how it is, my dear fellow. And
1|here we live, thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too,
1|there are good men as well as bad," said he, and still speaking, he
1|turned on his knees with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and
1|went off to another part of the shed.
1|
1|"Eh, you rascal!" Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the
1|other end of the shed. "So you've come, you rascal? She remembers...
1|Now, now, that'll do!"
1|
1|And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at
1|him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something
1|wrapped in a rag.
1|
1|"Here, eat a bit, sir," said he, resuming his former respectful tone
1|as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. "We had soup
1|for dinner and the potatoes are grand!"
1|
1|Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
1|extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.
1|
1|"Well, are they all right?" said the soldier with a smile. "You
1|should do like this."
1|
1|He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into
1|two equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it
1|from the rag, and handed it to Pierre.
1|
1|"The potatoes are grand!" he said once more. "Eat some like that!"
1|
1|Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.
1|
1|"Oh, I'm all right," said he, "but why did they shoot those poor
1|fellows? The last one was hardly twenty."
1|
1|"Tss, tt...!" said the little man. "Ah, what a sin... what a sin!"
1|he added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his
1|mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: "How was it, sir, that
1|you stayed in Moscow?"
1|
1|"I didn't think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,"
1|replied Pierre.
1|
1|"And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?"
1|
1|"No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and
1|tried me as an incendiary."
1|
1|"Where there's law there's injustice," put in the little man.
1|
1|"And have you been here long?" Pierre asked as he munched the last
1|of the potato.
1|
1|"I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow."
1|
1|"Why, are you a soldier then?"
1|
1|"Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment. I was dying of
1|fever. We weren't told anything. There were some twenty of us lying
1|there. We had no idea, never guessed at all."
1|
1|"And do you feel sad here?" Pierre inquired.
1|
1|"How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the surname is
1|Karataev," he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to
1|address him. "They call me 'little falcon' in the regiment. How is one
1|to help feeling sad? Moscow--she's the mother of cities. How can one
1|see all this and not feel sad? But 'the maggot gnaws the cabbage,
1|yet dies first'; that's what the old folks used to tell us," he
1|added rapidly.
1|
1|"What? What did you say?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Who? I?" said Karataev. "I say things happen not as we plan but
1|as God judges," he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had
1|said before, and immediately continued:
1|
1|"Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you
1|have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are
1|they still living?" he asked.
1|
1|And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a
1|suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as he put
1|these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents,
1|especially that he had no mother.
1|
1|"A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there's none
1|as dear as one's own mother!" said he. "Well, and have you little
1|ones?" he went on asking.
1|
1|Again Pierre's negative answer seemed to distress him, and he
1|hastened to add:
1|
1|"Never mind! You're young folks yet, and please God may still have
1|some. The great thing is to live in harmony...."
1|
1|"But it's all the same now," Pierre could not help saying.
1|
1|"Ah, my dear fellow!" rejoined Karataev, "never decline a prison
1|or a beggar's sack!"
1|
1|He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently
1|preparing to tell a long story.
1|
1|"Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home," he began. "We
1|had a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and
1|our house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing
1|there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so
1|happened..."
1|
1|And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into
1|someone's copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper,
1|had been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.
1|
1|"Well, lad," and a smile changed the tone of his voice "we thought
1|it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been
1|for my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my
1|younger brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a
1|wife behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a
1|soldier. I come home on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and
1|see that they are living better than before. The yard full of
1|cattle, the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only
1|Michael the youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my children are
1|the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if
1|Platon hadn't been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to
1|go.' called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front
1|of the icons. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and bow down to his feet;
1|and you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also
1|bow down before him! Do you understand?' he says. That's how it is,
1|dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always judging, 'that's
1|not well--that's not right!' Our luck is like water in a dragnet:
1|you pull at it and it bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's empty!
1|That's how it is."
1|
1|And Platon shifted his seat on the straw.
1|
1|After a short silence he rose.
1|
1|"Well, I think you must be sleepy," said he, and began rapidly
1|crossing himself and repeating:
1|
1|"Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus
1|Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ,
1|have mercy on us and save us!" he concluded, then bowed to the ground,
1|got up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. "That's the
1|way. Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf," he
1|muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.
1|
1|"What prayer was that you were saying?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"Eh?" murmured Platon, who had almost fallen asleep. "What was I
1|saying? I was praying. Don't you pray?"
1|
1|"Yes, I do," said Pierre. "But what was that you said: Frola and
1|Lavra?"
1|
1|"Well, of course," replied Platon quickly, "the horses' saints.
1|One must pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you've curled up
1|and got warm, you daughter of a bitch!" said Karataev, touching the
1|dog that lay at his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep
1|immediately.
1|
1|Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
1|outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but
1|inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep,
1|but lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular
1|snoring of Platon who lay beside him, and he felt that the world
1|that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a
1|new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were
1|confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he
1|remained for four weeks.
1|
1|When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures
1|to him except Platon Karataev, who always remained in his mind a
1|most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything
1|Russian, kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next
1|morning at dawn the first impression of him, as of something round,
1|was fully confirmed: Platon's whole figure--in a French overcoat
1|girdled with a cord, a soldier's cap, and bast shoes--was round. His
1|head was quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms,
1|which he held as if ever ready to embrace something, were rounded, his
1|pleasant smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were also round.
1|
1|Platon Karataev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of
1|campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not
1|himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his
1|brilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken
1|semicircles when he laughed--as he often did--were all sound and good,
1|there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole
1|body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and
1|endurance.
1|
1|His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of
1|innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief
1|peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It
1|was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going
1|to say, and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation
1|had an irresistible persuasiveness.
1|
1|His physical strength and agility during the first days of his
1|imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
1|sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: "Lord, lay
1|me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!" and every morning on
1|getting up, he said: "I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake
1|myself." And indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a
1|stone, and he only had to shake himself, to be ready without a
1|moment's delay for some work, just as children are ready to play
1|directly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not
1|badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was
1|always busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation--of
1|which he was fond--and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer
1|who knows he is listened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent
1|to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks
1|about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were always
1|high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his face at
1|such times was very serious.
1|
1|Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to
1|have thrown off all that had been forced upon him--everything military
1|and alien to himself--and had returned to his former peasant habits.
1|
1|"A soldier on leave--a shirt outside breeches," he would say.
1|
1|He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did
1|not complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once
1|during the whole of his army service. When he related anything it
1|was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his
1|"Christian" life, as he called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of
1|which his talk was full, were for the most part not the coarse and
1|indecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings which taken
1|without a context seem so insignificant, but when used appositely
1|suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom.
1|
1|He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a
1|previous occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he
1|talked well, adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with
1|folk sayings which Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief
1|charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events--sometimes
1|just such as Pierre had witnessed without taking notice of
1|them--assumed in Karataev's a character of solemn fitness. He liked to
1|hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening
1|(they were always the same), but most of all he liked to hear stories
1|of real life. He would smile joyfully when listening to such stories,
1|now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral
1|beauty of what he was told clear to himself. Karataev had no
1|attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre understood them, but
1|loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in
1|contact with, particularly with man--not any particular man, but those
1|with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the
1|French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite
1|of Karataev's affectionate tenderness for him (by which he
1|unconsciously gave Pierre's spiritual life its due) he would not have
1|grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in
1|the same way toward Karataev.
1|
1|To all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a most ordinary
1|soldier. They called him "little falcon" or "Platosha," chaffed him
1|good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always
1|remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable,
1|rounded, eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and
1|truth.
1|
1|Platon Karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he
1|began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.
1|
1|Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask
1|him to repeat them, but Platon could never recall what he had said a
1|moment before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of
1|his favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred
1|in it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of
1|it. He did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart
1|from their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation
1|of an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he
1|regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only
1|as part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and
1|actions flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as
1|fragrance exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value
1|or significance of any word or deed taken separately.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the
1|Rostovs at Yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her
1|aunt's efforts to dissuade her--and not merely to go herself but to
1|take her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy,
1|possible or impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it
1|was her duty not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps
1|dying, but to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so
1|she prepared to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew
1|himself, Princess Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to
1|his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her
1|and his son.
1|
1|In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were
1|the huge family coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, a
1|semiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle
1|Bourienne, little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three
1|maids, Tikhon, and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to
1|accompany her.
1|
1|The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the
1|roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk,
1|Ryazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long and, as post horses were not
1|everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan where the
1|French were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.
1|
1|During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and
1|Princess Mary's servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
1|spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and
1|no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy,
1|which infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslavl by
1|the end of the second week.

1|The last days of her stay in Voronezh had been the happiest of her
1|life. Her love for Rostov no longer tormented or agitated her. It
1|filled her whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she
1|no longer struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that
1|she loved and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to
1|herself in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview
1|with Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was
1|with the Rostovs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the
1|fact that Prince Andrew's relations with Natasha might, if he
1|recovered, be renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he
1|knew and thought of this.
1|
1|Yet in spite of that, his relation to her--considerate, delicate,
1|and loving--not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to
1|Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between
1|them allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew
1|that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that
1|she was beloved, and was happy in regard to it.
1|
1|But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not
1|prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the
1|contrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the
1|more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her
1|brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving
1|Voronezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn,
1|despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But
1|the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she
1|took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and
1|gave her strength.
1|
1|As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of
1|the journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached
1|Yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there--not after many
1|days, but that very evening--again presented itself to her and her
1|agitation increased to its utmost limit.
1|
1|The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
1|Rostovs were staying in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince Andrew
1|was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was
1|appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess' face that looked
1|out at him from the window.
1|
1|"I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostovs are
1|staying at the merchant Bronnikov's house, in the Square not far
1|from here, right above the Volga," said the courier.
1|
1|Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not
1|understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know:
1|how was her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.
1|
1|"How is the prince?" she asked.
1|
1|"His excellency is staying in the same house with them."
1|
1|"Then he is alive," thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:
1|"How is he?"
1|
1|"The servants say he is still the same."
1|
1|What "still the same" might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with
1|an unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting
1|in front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her
1|head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling,
1|shaking and swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as
1|they were let down.
1|
1|The carriage door was opened. On the left there was water--a great
1|river--and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:
1|servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as
1|it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This
1|was Sonya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. "This way, this way!" said
1|the girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found
1|herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came
1|rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She
1|embraced Princess Mary and kissed her.
1|
1|"Mon enfant!" she muttered, "je vous aime et vous connais depuis
1|longtemps."*
1|
1|
1|*"My child! I love you and have known you a long time."
1|
1|
1| Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the
1|countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly
1|knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
1|French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and
1|asked: "How is he?"
1|
1|"The doctor says that he is not in danger," said the countess, but
1|as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed
1|a contradiction of her words.
1|
1|"Where is he? Can I see him--can I?" asked the princess.
1|
1|"One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?" said
1|the countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with
1|Dessalles. "There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh,
1|what a lovely boy!"
1|
1|The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sonya
1|was talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the
1|boy, and the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had
1|changed very much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had
1|been a brisk, cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful,
1|bewildered person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually
1|looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right
1|thing. After the destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out
1|of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own
1|significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in
1|life.
1|
1|In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible,
1|and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him
1|they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her
1|nephew, the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt
1|the necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things
1|which she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it
1|was hard for her she was not vexed with these people.
1|
1|"This is my niece," said the count, introducing Sonya--"You don't
1|know her, Princess?"
1|
1|Princess Mary turned to Sonya and, trying to stifle the hostile
1|feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she
1|felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so
1|far from what was in her own heart.
1|
1|"Where is he?" she asked again, addressing them all.
1|
1|"He is downstairs. Natasha is with him," answered Sonya, flushing.
1|"We have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess."
1|
1|Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary's eyes. She
1|turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to
1|him, when light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard
1|at the door. The princess looked round and saw Natasha coming in,
1|almost running--that Natasha whom she had liked so little at their
1|meeting in Moscow long since.
1|
1|But hardly had the princess looked at Natasha's face before she
1|realized that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a
1|friend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her
1|shoulder.
1|
1|As soon as Natasha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew's bed,
1|heard of Princess Mary's arrival, she softly left his room and
1|hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to
1|Princess Mary.
1|
1|There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into
1|the drawing room--that of love--boundless love for him, for her, and
1|for all that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for
1|others, and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping
1|them. It was plain that at that moment there was in Natasha's heart no
1|thought of herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.
1|
1|Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at
1|the first glance at Natasha's face, and wept on her shoulder with
1|sorrowful pleasure.
1|
1|"Come, come to him, Mary," said Natasha, leading her into the
1|other room.
1|
1|Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to
1|Natasha. She felt that from her she would be able to understand and
1|learn everything.
1|
1|"How..." she began her question but stopped short.
1|
1|She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.
1|Natasha's face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly
1|and profoundly.
1|
1|Natasha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to
1|say all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous
1|eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was
1|impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly,
1|Natasha's lips twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and
1|covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs.
1|
1|Princess Mary understood.
1|
1|But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:
1|
1|"But how is his wound? What is his general condition?"
1|
1|"You, you... will see," was all Natasha could say.
1|
1|They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had
1|left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.
1|
1|"How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse?
1|When did this happen?" Princess Mary inquired.
1|
1|Natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his
1|feverish condition and the pain he suffered, but at Troitsa that had
1|passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger
1|had also passed. When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to
1|fester (Natasha knew all about such things as festering) and the
1|doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course. Then
1|fever set in, but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.
1|
1|"But two days ago this suddenly happened," said Natasha,
1|struggling with her sobs. "I don't know why, but you will see what
1|he is like."
1|
1|"Is he weaker? Thinner?" asked the princess.
1|
1|"No, it's not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too
1|good, he cannot, cannot live, because..."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|When Natasha opened Prince Andrew's door with a familiar movement
1|and let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt
1|the sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself,
1|and now tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to
1|look at him without tears.
1|
1|The princess understood what Natasha had meant by the words: "two
1|days ago this suddenly happened." She understood those words to mean
1|that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness
1|were signs of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she
1|already saw in imagination Andrew's face as she remembered it in
1|childhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown,
1|and which therefore affected her very strongly. She was sure he
1|would speak soft, tender words to her such as her father had uttered
1|before his death, and that she would not be able to bear it and
1|would burst into sobs in his presence. Yet sooner or later it had to
1|be, and she went in. The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat
1|as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her
1|shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and then she saw his
1|face and met his gaze.
1|
1|He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan,
1|surrounded by pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin,
1|translucently white hand he held a handkerchief, while with the
1|other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown, moving his
1|fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they entered.
1|
1|On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary's pace
1|suddenly slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She
1|suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of
1|his face and eyes.
1|
1|"But in what am I to blame?" she asked herself. And his cold,
1|stern look replied: "Because you are alive and thinking of the living,
1|while I..."
1|
1|In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but
1|inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded
1|his sister and Natasha.
1|
1|He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.
1|
1|"How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?" said he in a
1|voice as calm and aloof as his look.
1|
1|Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such
1|horror into Princess Mary's heart as the tone of his voice.
1|
1|"And have you brought little Nicholas?" he asked in the same slow,
1|quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember.
1|
1|"How are you now?" said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she
1|was saying.
1|
1|"That, my dear, you must ask the doctor," he replied, and again
1|making an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips
1|only (his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):
1|
1|"Merci, chere amie, d'etre venue."*
1|
1|
1|*"Thank you for coming, my dear."
1|
1|
1|Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just
1|perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She
1|now understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words,
1|his tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look
1|could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world,
1|terrible in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he
1|understand anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to
1|understand, not because he lacked the power to do so but because he
1|understood something else--something the living did not and could
1|not understand--and which wholly occupied his mind.
1|
1|"There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together," said
1|he, breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha. "She looks after
1|me all the time."
1|
1|Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such
1|a thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say
1|that, before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to
1|live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone.
1|If he had not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to
1|pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence? The only
1|explanation was that he was indifferent, because something else,
1|much more important, had been revealed to him.
1|
1|The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke
1|off.
1|
1|"Mary came by way of Ryazan," said Natasha.
1|
1|Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and
1|only after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it
1|herself.
1|
1|"Really?" he asked.
1|
1|"They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that..."
1|
1|Natasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was
1|making an effort to listen, but could not do so.
1|
1|"Yes, they say it's burned," he said. "It's a great pity," and he
1|gazed straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his
1|fingers.
1|
1|"And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?" Prince Andrew suddenly
1|said, evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. "He wrote here
1|that he took a great liking to you," he went on simply and calmly,
1|evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his
1|words had for living people. "If you liked him too, it would be a good
1|thing for you to get married," he added rather more quickly, as if
1|pleased at having found words he had long been seeking.
1|
1|Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her,
1|except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.
1|
1|"Why talk of me?" she said quietly and glanced at Natasha.
1|
1|Natasha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were
1|again silent.
1|
1|"Andrew, would you like..." Princess Mary suddenly said in a
1|trembling voice, "would you like to see little Nicholas? He is
1|always talking about you!"
1|
1|Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but
1|Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he
1|did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with
1|quiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she
1|believed to be the last means of arousing him.
1|
1|"Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?"
1|
1|When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew's room he looked
1|at his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one
1|else was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know
1|what to say to him.
1|
1|When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to
1|her brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer
1|began to cry.
1|
1|He looked at her attentively.
1|
1|"Is it about Nicholas?" he asked.
1|
1|Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.
1|
1|"Mary, you know the Gosp..." but he broke off.
1|
1|"What did you say?"
1|
1|"Nothing. You mustn't cry here," he said, looking at her with the
1|same cold expression.
1|
1|
1|When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying
1|at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father.
1|With a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things
1|from their point of view.
1|
1|"Yes, to them it must seem sad!" he thought. "But how simple it is.
1|
1|"The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father
1|feedeth them," he said to himself and wished to say to Princess
1|Mary; "but no, they will take it their own way, they won't understand!
1|They can't understand that all those feelings they prize so--all our
1|feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are
1|unnecessary. We cannot understand one another," and he remained
1|silent.
1|
1|
1|Prince Andrew's little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and
1|knew nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining
1|knowledge, observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the
1|faculties he afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or
1|more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had
1|witnessed between his father, Mary, and Natasha, than he had then.
1|He understood it completely, and, leaving the room without crying,
1|went silently up to Natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly
1|at her with his beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy
1|upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry.
1|
1|After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him
1|and either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Natasha
1|of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them
1|quietly and shyly.
1|
1|When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood
1|what Natasha's face had told her. She did not speak any more to
1|Natasha of hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside
1|his sofa, and did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in
1|soul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the
1|dying man was now so evident.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he
1|was dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an
1|aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness
1|of existence. Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming.
1|That inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which
1|he had felt continually all his life--was now near to him and, by
1|the strange lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and
1|palpable...
1|
1|
1|Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that
1|terribly tormenting fear of death--the end--but now he no longer
1|understood that fear.
1|
1| He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top
1|before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the
1|sky, and knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to
1|himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love
1|had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage
1|of life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased
1|to think about it.
1|
1|During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he
1|spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new
1|principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously
1|detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody
1|and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not
1|to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that
1|principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more
1|completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which--in the absence of
1|such love--stands between life and death. When during those first days
1|he remembered that he would have to die, he said to himself: "Well,
1|what of it? So much the better!"
1|
1|But after the night in Mytishchi when, half delirious, he had seen
1|her for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her
1|hand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a
1|particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more
1|bound him to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy
1|his mind. Recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had
1|seen Kuragin, he could not now regain the feeling he then had, but was
1|tormented by the question whether Kuragin was alive. And he dared
1|not inquire.
1|
1|His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natasha
1|referred to when she said: "This suddenly happened," had occurred
1|two days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual
1|struggle between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It
1|was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life
1|as presented to him in the form of his love for Natasha, and a last,
1|though ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.
1|
1|It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish,
1|and his thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sonya was sitting by
1|the table. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized
1|him.
1|
1|"Ah, she has come!" thought he.
1|
1|And so it was: in Sonya's place sat Natasha who had just come in
1|noiselessly.
1|
1|Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced
1|this physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an
1|armchair placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from
1|him, and was knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings
1|since Prince Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick
1|so well as old nurses who knit stockings, and that there is
1|something soothing in the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked
1|lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see
1|the thoughtful profile of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball
1|rolled off her knees. She started, glanced round at him, and screening
1|the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact
1|movement, picked up the ball, and regained her former position.
1|
1|He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a
1|deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed
1|cautiously.
1|
1|At the Troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had
1|told her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound
1|which had brought them together again, but after that they never spoke
1|of the future.
1|
1|"Can it or can it not be?" he now thought as he looked at her and
1|listened to the light click of the steel needles. "Can fate have
1|brought me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible
1|that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that
1|I have spent my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in
1|the world! But what am I to do if I love her?" he thought, and he
1|involuntarily groaned, from a habit acquired during his sufferings.
1|
1|On hearing that sound Natasha put down the stocking, leaned nearer
1|to him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to
1|him and bent over him.
1|
1|"You are not asleep?"
1|
1|"No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in.
1|No one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do...
1|that light. I want to weep for joy."
1|
1|Natasha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.
1|
1|"Natasha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world."
1|
1|"And I!"--She turned away for an instant. "Why too much?" she asked.
1|
1|"Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your
1|soul, your whole soul--shall I live? What do you think?"
1|
1|"I am sure of it, sure!" Natasha almost shouted, taking hold of both
1|his hands with a passionate movement.
1|
1|He remained silent awhile.
1|
1|"How good it would be!" and taking her hand he kissed it.
1|
1|Natasha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this
1|would not do and that he had to be quiet.
1|
1|"But you have not slept," she said, repressing her joy. "Try to
1|sleep... please!"
1|
1|He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle
1|and sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked
1|at him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on
1|her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.
1|
1|Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep
1|long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.
1|
1|As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
1|always occupied his mind--about life and death, and chiefly about
1|death. He felt himself nearer to it.
1|
1|"Love? What is love?" he thought.
1|
1|"Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I
1|understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is,
1|everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it
1|alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall
1|return to the general and eternal source." These thoughts seemed to
1|him comforting. But they were only thoughts. Something was lacking
1|in them, they were not clear, they were too one-sidedly personal and
1|brain-spun. And there was the former agitation and obscurity. He
1|fell asleep.
1|
1|He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but
1|that he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and
1|insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and
1|discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.
1|Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
1|more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by
1|empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to
1|disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded
1|all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything
1|depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went,
1|and tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he
1|would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all
1|his powers. He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was
1|the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was
1|clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the
1|other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in.
1|Something not human--death--was breaking in through that door, and had
1|to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it
1|back--to lock it was no longer possible--but his efforts were weak and
1|clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and
1|closed again.
1|
1|Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts
1|were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It
1|entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died.
1|
1|But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was
1|asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he
1|awoke.
1|
1|"Yes, it was death! I died--and woke up. Yes, death is an
1|awakening!" And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil
1|that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual
1|vision. He felt as if powers till then confined within him had been
1|liberated, and that strange lightness did not again leave him.
1|
1|When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan,
1|Natasha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer
1|and looked at her strangely, not understanding.
1|
1|That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary's
1|arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting
1|fever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did
1|not interest Natasha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her
1|were more convincing.
1|
1|From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew
1|together with his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration
1|of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep
1|compared to the duration of a dream.
1|
1|There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
1|awakening.
1|
1|His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both
1|Princess Mary and Natasha, who did not leave him, felt this. They
1|did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves
1|felt that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he
1|had left them) but on what reminded them most closely of him--his
1|body. Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of
1|death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment
1|their grief. Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep,
1|nor did they ever talk to one another about him. They felt that they
1|could not express in words what they understood.
1|
1|They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and
1|deeper, away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so
1|and that it was right.
1|
1|He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of
1|him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the
1|boy's and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess
1|Mary and Natasha understood that) but simply because he thought it was
1|all that was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy,
1|he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there
1|was anything else he should do.
1|
1|When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,
1|occurred, Princess Mary and Natasha were present.
1|
1|"Is it over?" said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes
1|lain motionless, growing cold before them. Natasha went up, looked
1|at the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but
1|did not kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of
1|him--his body.
1|
1|"Where has he gone? Where is he now?..."
1|
1|When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,
1|everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.
1|
1|Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful
1|perplexity. The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and
1|because he was no more. The old count cried because he felt that
1|before long, he, too, must take the same terrible step.
1|
1|Natasha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their
1|own personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion
1|which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of
1|the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in
1|their presence.

1|BOOK THIRTEEN: 1812
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Man's mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness,
1|but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man's soul. And
1|without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions
1|any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he
1|snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him
1|intelligible and says: "This is the cause!" In historical events
1|(where the actions of men are the subject of observation) the first
1|and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the
1|gods and, after that, the will of those who stood in the most
1|prominent position--the heroes of history. But we need only penetrate
1|to the essence of any historic event--which lies in the activity of
1|the general mass of men who take part in it--to be convinced that the
1|will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but
1|is itself continually controlled. It may seem to be a matter of
1|indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events
1|this way or that; yet there is the same difference between a man who
1|says that the people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon
1|wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to
1|happen, as there is between those who declared that the earth was
1|stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted
1|that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there were laws
1|directing its movement and that of the other planets. There is, and
1|can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all
1|causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws
1|are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.
1|The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite
1|abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,
1|just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was
1|possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the
1|earth.
1|
1|The historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodino and the
1|occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the
1|most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the
1|Russian army from the Ryazana to the Kaluga road and to the Tarutino
1|camp--the so-called flank march across the Krasnaya Pakhra River. They
1|ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and
1|dispute as to whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians,
1|including the French, acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders
1|when they speak of that flank march. But it is hard to understand
1|why military writers, and following them others, consider this flank
1|march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved Russia
1|and destroyed Napoleon. In the first place it is hard to understand
1|where the profundity and genius of this movement lay, for not much
1|mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army
1|when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions;
1|and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best
1|position for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on
1|the Kaluga road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning
1|the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a
1|profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why
1|they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and
1|destroy the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded,
1|accompanied, or followed by other circumstances, might have proved
1|ruinous to the Russians and salutary for the French. If the position
1|of the Russian army really began to improve from the time of that
1|march, it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it.
1|
1|That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
1|the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its
1|destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If
1|Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained
1|inactive? If the Russian army at Krasnaya Pakhra had given battle as
1|Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French
1|attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhra? What
1|would have happened if on approaching Tarutino, Napoleon had
1|attacked the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when
1|he attacked them at Smolensk? What would have happened had the
1|French moved on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank
1|march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous.
1|
1|The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
1|history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
1|attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in
1|reality, like the retreat from Fili, it did not suggest itself to
1|anyone in its entirety, but resulted--moment by moment, step by
1|step, event by event--from an endless number of most diverse
1|circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been
1|accomplished and belonged to the past.
1|
1|At the council at Fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the
1|Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely,
1|a direct retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of this there is the
1|fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and
1|above all there is the well-known conversation after the council,
1|between the commander in chief and Lanskoy, who was in charge of the
1|commissariat department. Lanskoy informed the commander in chief
1|that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the Oka
1|in the Tula and Ryazan provinces, and that if they retreated on Nizhni
1|the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river
1|Oka, which cannot be crossed early in winter. This was the first
1|indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously
1|seemed the most natural course--a direct retreat on Nizhni-Novgorod.
1|The army turned more to the south, along the Ryazan road and nearer to
1|its supplies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French (who even
1|lost sight of the Russian army), concern for the safety of the arsenal
1|at Tula, and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its
1|supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the Tula road.
1|Having crossed over, by a forced march, to the Tula road beyond the
1|Pakhra, the Russian commanders intended to remain at Podolsk and had
1|no thought of the Tarutino position; but innumerable circumstances and
1|the reappearance of French troops who had for a time lost touch with
1|the Russians, and projects of giving battle, and above all the
1|abundance of provisions in Kaluga province, obliged our army to turn
1|still more to the south and to cross from the Tula to the Kaluga
1|road and go to Tarutino, which was between the roads along which those
1|supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to
1|abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say precisely when, or by whom,
1|it was decided to move to Tarutino. Only when the army had got
1|there, as the result of innumerable and varying forces, did people
1|begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and
1|long ago foreseen its result.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the
1|advance of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been
1|continually retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated
1|from that direct course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally
1|drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant.
1|
1|If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading
1|the Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could
1|not have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow,
1|describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be
1|found and where the country was richest.
1|
1|That movement from the Nizhni to the Ryazan, Tula, and Kaluga
1|roads was so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that
1|direction, and demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutuzov to take
1|his army that way. At Tarutino Kutuzov received what was almost a
1|reprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army along the
1|Ryazan road, and the Emperor's letter indicated to him the very
1|position he had already occupied near Kaluga.
1|
1|Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the
1|whole campaign and by the battle of Borodino, the Russian army--when
1|the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was
1|received--assumed the position natural to it.
1|
1|Kutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as
1|it is called, but in the fact that he alone understood the
1|significance of what had happened. He alone then understood the
1|meaning of the French army's inactivity, he alone continued to
1|assert that the battle of Borodino had been a victory, he alone--who
1|as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to
1|attack--employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian army
1|from useless engagements.
1|
1|The beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had
1|left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
1|merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was
1|heard to moan.
1|
1|The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed
1|its calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov's
1|camp with overtures for peace.
1|
1|Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head
1|was right, wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him,
1|though they were meaningless.
1|
1|
1|MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my
1|adjutants-general to discuss several interesting questions with you. I
1|beg your Highness to credit what he says to you, especially when he
1|expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long
1|entertained for your person. This letter having no other object, I
1|pray God, monsieur le Prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and
1|gracious protection!
1|
1|NAPOLEON
1|
1|MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812
1|
1|
1|Kutuzov replied: "I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on
1|as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present
1|spirit of my nation." But he continued to exert all his powers to
1|restrain his troops from attacking.
1|
1|During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and
1|the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarutino, a change had
1|taken place in the relative strength of the two armies--both in spirit
1|and in number--as a result of which the superiority had passed to
1|the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French
1|army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the
1|need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These
1|signs were: Lauriston's mission; the abundance of provisions at
1|Tarutino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and
1|disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the
1|fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and
1|the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually
1|shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what
1|the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with
1|which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at
1|Tarutino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and
1|guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire
1|for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the
1|French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every
1|soldier's mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed
1|and that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial
1|change in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable.
1|And at once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the
1|minute hand has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an
1|increased activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|The Russian army was commanded by Kutuzov and his staff, and also by
1|the Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of
1|Moscow had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole
1|campaign had been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for his guidance.
1|Though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow
1|was still in our hands, it was approved by the staff and accepted as a
1|basis for action. Kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from
1|a distance were always difficult to execute. So fresh instructions
1|were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be
1|encountered, as well as fresh people who were to watch Kutuzov's
1|actions and report upon them.
1|
1|Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now
1|reorganized. The posts left vacant by Bagration, who had been
1|killed, and by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be
1|filled. Very serious consideration was given to the question whether
1|it would be better to put A in B's place and B in D's, or on the
1|contrary to put D in A's place, and so on--as if anything more than
1|A's or B's satisfaction depended on this.
1|
1|As a result of the hostility between Kutuzov and Bennigsen, his
1|Chief of Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the
1|Emperor, and these transfers, a more than usually complicated play
1|of parties was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining
1|B, D was undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and
1|permutations. In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was
1|generally the conduct of the war, which all these men believed they
1|were directing; but this affair of the war went on independently of
1|them, as it had to go: that is, never in the way people devised, but
1|flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses. Only in
1|the highest spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and
1|interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen.
1|
1|
1|Prince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of
1|October in a letter that reached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino)
1|Since September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last
1|reports were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not
1|only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of
1|the ancient capital, but according to your last report you have even
1|retreated farther. Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy
1|detachment and Tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the
1|army, is in danger. From General Wintzingerode's reports, I see that
1|an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road.
1|Another corps of several thousand men is moving on Dmitrov. A third
1|has advanced along the Vladimir road, and a fourth, rather
1|considerable detachment is stationed between Ruza and Mozhaysk.
1|Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth. In view of
1|all this information, when the enemy has scattered his forces in large
1|detachments, and with Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it
1|possible that the enemy's forces confronting you are so considerable
1|as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is
1|probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with an army
1|corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem
1|that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might
1|advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least
1|oblige him to retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the
1|provinces now occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger
1|from Tula and other towns in the interior. You will be responsible
1|if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against
1|Petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been
1|possible to retain many troops; for with the army entrusted to you,
1|and acting with resolution and energy, you have ample means to avert
1|this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still to answer to our
1|offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have experienced my
1|readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken in me, but I
1|and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and
1|success which your intellect, military talent, and the courage of
1|the troops you command justify us in expecting.
1|
1|
1|But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation
1|of the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was
1|dispatched, Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain
1|the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.
1|
1|On the second of October a Cossack, Shapovalov, who was out
1|scouting, killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded
1|hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left
1|flank of Murat's army, encamped there without any precautions. The
1|Cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the
1|hands of the French. A cornet, hearing the story, informed his
1|commander.
1|
1|The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished
1|to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of
1|the superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,
1|reported the incident to a general on the staff.  The state of
1|things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Ermolov had
1|been to see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to
1|use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take
1|the offensive.
1|
1|"If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you
1|are asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure
1|to do the opposite," replied Bennigsen.
1|
1|The Cossack's report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent
1|out, was the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled
1|spring was released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to
1|play. Despite all his supposed power, his intellect, his experience,
1|and his knowledge of men, Kutuzov--having taken into consideration the
1|Cossack's report, a note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to
1|the Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the
1|fact that all the generals expressed the same wish--could no longer
1|check the inevitable movement, and gave the order to do what he
1|regarded as useless and harmful--gave his approval, that is, to the
1|accomplished fact.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Bennigsen's note and the Cossack's information that the left flank
1|of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it
1|was necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of
1|October.
1|
1|On the morning of the fourth of October Kutuzov signed the
1|dispositions. Toll read them to Ermolov, asking him to attend to the
1|further arrangements.
1|
1|"All right--all right. I haven't time just now," replied Ermolov,
1|and left the hut.
1|
1|The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the
1|Austerlitz dispositions, it was written--though not in German this
1|time:
1|
1|"The First Column will march here and here," "the Second Column will
1|march there and there," and so on; and on paper, all these columns
1|arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.
1|Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,
1|and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at
1|the appointed time.
1|
1|When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been
1|prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to
1|Ermolov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutuzov's
1|orderly, pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him,
1|went to Ermolov's quarters.
1|
1|"Gone away," said Ermolov's orderly.
1|
1|The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom
1|Ermolov was often to be found.
1|
1|"No, and the general's out too."
1|
1|The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.
1|
1|"No, he's gone out."
1|
1|"If only they don't make me responsible for this delay! What a
1|nuisance it is!" thought the officer, and he rode round the whole
1|camp. One man said he had seen Ermolov ride past with some other
1|generals, others said he must have returned home. The officer searched
1|till six o'clock in the evening without even stopping to eat.
1|Ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was. The
1|officer snatched a little food at a comrade's, and rode again to the
1|vanguard to find Miloradovich. Miloradovich too was away, but here
1|he was told that he had gone to a ball at General Kikin's and that
1|Ermolov was probably there too.
1|
1|"But where is it?"
1|
1|"Why, there, over at Echkino," said a Cossack officer, pointing to a
1|country house in the far distance.
1|
1|"What, outside our line?"
1|
1|"They've put two regiments as outposts, and they're having such a
1|spree there, it's awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!"
1|
1|The officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino. While still at a
1|distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance
1|song proceeding from the house.
1|
1|"In the meadows... in the meadows!" he heard, accompanied by
1|whistling and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by
1|shouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he
1|was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner
1|the important order entrusted to him. It was already past eight
1|o'clock. He dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country
1|house which had remained intact between the Russian and French forces.
1|In the refreshment room and the hall, footmen were bustling about with
1|wine and viands. Groups of singers stood outside the windows. The
1|officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the
1|army together, and among them Ermolov's big imposing figure. They
1|all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle
1|with flushed and animated faces, laughing loudly. In the middle of the
1|room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak
1|with much spirit and agility.
1|
1|"Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivanych! Ha, ha, ha!"
1|
1|The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a
1|moment he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait;
1|but one of the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come
1|about, informed Ermolov.
1|
1|Ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what
1|the officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.
1|
1|
1|"You think he went off just by chance?" said a comrade, who was on
1|the staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards,
1|referring to Ermolov. "It was a trick. It was done on purpose to get
1|Konovnitsyn into trouble. You'll see what a mess there'll be
1|tomorrow."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|Next day the decrepit Kutuzov, having given orders to be called
1|early, said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant
1|consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of,
1|got into his caleche and drove from Letashovka (a village three and
1|a half miles from Tarutino) to the place where the attacking columns
1|were to meet. He sat in the caleche, dozing and waking up by turns,
1|and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication
1|that the action had begun. But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn
1|morning was just dawning. On approaching Tarutino Kutuzov noticed
1|cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which
1|he was driving. Kutuzov looked at them searchingly, stopped his
1|carriage, and inquired what regiment they belonged to. They belonged
1|to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long
1|before then. "It may be a mistake," thought the old commander in
1|chief. But a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their
1|arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed, eating their rye
1|porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The officer
1|reported that no order to advance had been received.
1|
1|"How! Not rec..." Kutuzov began, but checked himself immediately and
1|sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his caleche, he waited
1|with drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down.
1|When Eykhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned,
1|appeared, Kutuzov went purple in the face, not because that officer
1|was to blame for the mistake, but because he was an object of
1|sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and
1|panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes
1|used to roll on the ground, and he fell upon Eykhen, threatening him
1|with his hands, shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another
1|man, Captain Brozin, who happened to turn up and who was not at all to
1|blame, suffered the same fate.
1|
1|"What sort of another blackguard are you? I'll have you shot!
1|Scoundrels!" yelled Kutuzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and
1|reeling.
1|
1|He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene
1|Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever
1|had in Russia, to be placed in this position--made the laughingstock
1|of the whole army! "I needn't have been in such a hurry to pray
1|about today, or have kept awake thinking everything over all night,"
1|thought he to himself. "When I was a chit of an officer no one would
1|have dared to mock me so... and now!" He was in a state of physical
1|suffering as if from corporal punishment, and could not avoid
1|expressing it by cries of anger and distress. But his strength soon
1|began to fail him, and looking about him, conscious of having said
1|much that was amiss, he again got into his caleche and drove back in
1|silence.
1|
1|His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he
1|listened to excuses and self-justifications (Ermolov did not come to
1|see him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen,
1|Konovnitsyn, and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should
1|be executed next day. And once more Kutuzov had to consent.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the
1|evening and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with
1|dark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy,
1|and the troops advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of
1|the artillery could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk
1|out loud, to smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried
1|to prevent their horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking
1|heightened its charm and they marched gaily. Some columns,
1|supposing they had reached their destination, halted, piled arms, and
1|settled down on the cold ground, but the majority marched all night
1|and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been.
1|
1|Only Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cossacks (the least important
1|detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time.
1|This detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path
1|leading from the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk.
1|
1|Toward dawn, Count Orlov-Denisov, who had dozed off, was awakened by
1|a deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a
1|Polish sergeant of Poniatowski's corps, who explained in Polish that
1|he had come over because he had been slighted in the service: that
1|he ought long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver
1|than any of them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them
1|out. He said that Murat was spending the night less than a mile from
1|where they were, and that if they would let him have a convoy of a
1|hundred men he would capture him alive. Count Orlov-Denisov
1|consulted his fellow officers.
1|
1|The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go
1|and everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and
1|arguing, Major-General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided to go
1|with the Polish sergeant.
1|
1|"Now, remember," said Count Orlov-Denisov to the sergeant at
1|parting, "if you have been lying I'll have you hanged like a dog;
1|but if it's true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!"
1|
1|Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and
1|rode away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled. They
1|disappeared into the forest, and Count Orlov-Denisov, having seen
1|Grekov off, returned, shivering from the freshness of the early dawn
1|and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility, and
1|began looking at the enemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive
1|light of dawn and the dying campfires. Our columns ought to have begun
1|to appear on an open declivity to his right. He looked in that
1|direction, but though the columns would have been visible quite far
1|off, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count that things were
1|beginning to stir in the French camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant
1|confirmed this.
1|
1|"Oh, it is really too late," said Count Orlov, looking at the camp.
1|
1|As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before
1|our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
1|sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian
1|attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which he
1|would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a
1|commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!
1|
1|"I am sure that rascal was lying," said the count.
1|
1|"They can still be called back," said one of his suite, who like
1|Count Orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the
1|enemy's camp.
1|
1|"Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?"
1|
1|"Will you have them fetched back?"
1|
1|"Fetch them back, fetch them back!" said Count Orlov with sudden
1|determination, looking at his watch. "It will be too late. It is quite
1|light."
1|
1|And the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grekov. When
1|Grekov returned, Count Orlov-Denisov, excited both by the abandoned
1|attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not
1|appear, as well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance.
1|All his men felt the same excitement.
1|
1|"Mount!" he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and
1|crossed themselves.... "Forward, with God's aid!"
1|
1|"Hurrah-ah-ah!" reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack
1|companies, trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if
1|poured out of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.
1|
1|One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw
1|the Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just
1|waking up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and
1|horses.
1|
1|Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind
1|and around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.
1|That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the
1|Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of
1|them listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight
1|guns were taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most
1|important to the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like.
1|All this had to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the
1|booty divided--not without some shouting and even a little fighting
1|among themselves--and it was on this that the Cossacks all busied
1|themselves.
1|
1|The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover
1|themselves: they formed into detachments and began firing.
1|Orlov-Denisov, still waiting for the other columns to arrive, advanced
1|no further.
1|
1|Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that "the First
1|Column will march" and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,
1|commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due
1|order and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their
1|appointed places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully,
1|began to halt; murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and
1|finally a backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about,
1|shouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and
1|were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and
1|went forward, simply to get somewhere. "We shall get somewhere or
1|other!" And they did indeed get somewhere, though not to their right
1|places; a few eventually even got to their right place, but too late
1|to be of any use and only in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this
1|battle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped
1|assiduously from place to place, finding everything upside down
1|everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagovut's corps in a wood when it
1|was already broad daylight, though the corps should long before have
1|joined Orlov-Denisov. Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing
1|that someone must be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the
1|commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely, saying
1|that he ought to be shot. General Bagovut, a fighting old soldier of
1|placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion,
1|and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's surprise and quite
1|contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll.
1|
1|"I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men
1|as well as anybody," he said, and advanced with a single division.
1|
1|Coming out onto a field under the enemy's fire, this brave general
1|went straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering
1|in his agitation whether going into action now, with a single
1|division, would be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets
1|were just what he needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets
1|killed him, and other bullets killed many of his men. And his division
1|remained under fire for some time quite uselessly.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the
1|front, but Kutuzov accompanied that column. He well knew that
1|nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his
1|will, and as far as was in his power held the troops back. He did
1|not advance.
1|
1|He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering
1|suggestions that they should attack.
1|
1|"The word attack is always on your tongue, but you don't see that we
1|are unable to execute complicated maneuvers," said he to
1|Miloradovich who asked permission to advance.
1|
1|"We couldn't take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
1|time, and nothing can be done now!" he replied to someone else.
1|
1|When Kutuzov was informed that at the French rear--where according
1|to the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody--there
1|were now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Ermolov
1|who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous
1|day.
1|
1|"You see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,
1|but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,
1|forewarned, takes measures accordingly."
1|
1|Ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these
1|words. He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that
1|Kutuzov would content himself with that hint.
1|
1|"He's having a little fun at my expense," said Ermolov softly,
1|nudging with his knee Raevski who was at his side.
1|
1|Soon after this, Ermolov moved up to Kutuzov and respectfully
1|remarked:
1|
1|"It is not too late yet, your Highness--the enemy has not gone
1|away--if you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so
1|much as see a little smoke."
1|
1|Kutuzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat's
1|troops were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every
1|hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour.
1|
1|The whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov's Cossacks had
1|done: the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.
1|
1|In consequence of this battle Kutuzov received a diamond decoration,
1|and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also
1|received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various
1|grades, and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.
1|
1|"That's how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!" said the
1|Russian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be
1|understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that
1|we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today.
1|But people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking
1|about or deliberately deceive themselves. No battle--Tarutino,
1|Borodino, or Austerlitz--takes place as those who planned it
1|anticipated. That is an essential condition.
1|
1|A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than
1|during a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence
1|the course taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in
1|advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force.
1|
1|If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a
1|given body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one
1|of those forces, but will always be a mean--what in mechanics is
1|represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.
1|
1|If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French
1|ones, we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with
1|previously formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those
1|descriptions are false.
1|
1|The battle of Tarutino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in
1|view--to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
1|dispositions; nor that which Count Orlov-Denisov may have had in
1|view--to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying
1|the whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor
1|the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish
1|himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got,
1|and so on. But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and
1|what all the Russians of that day desired--to drive the French out of
1|Russia and destroy their army--it is quite clear that the battle of
1|Tarutino, just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was
1|wanted at that stage of the campaign. It would be difficult and even
1|impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual
1|outcome of this battle. With a minimum of effort and insignificant
1|losses, despite the greatest confusion, the most important results of
1|the whole campaign were attained: the transition from retreat to
1|advance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the
1|administration of that shock which Napoleon's army had only awaited to
1|begin its flight.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa;
1|there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in
1|the hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their
1|ancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and
1|incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon's hands. The Russian army, only
1|half the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to
1|attack for a whole month. Napoleon's position is most brilliant. He
1|can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and
1|destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal
1|make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse,
1|return to Smolensk or Vilna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special
1|genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position
1|the French held at that time. For that, only very simple and easy
1|steps were necessary: not to allow the troops to loot, to prepare
1|winter clothing--of which there was sufficient in Moscow for the whole
1|army--and methodically to collect the provisions, of which
1|(according to the French historians) there were enough in Moscow to
1|supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of
1|all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of the army, took
1|none of these steps.
1|
1|He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used
1|his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses
1|open to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in
1|Moscow, advancing on Petersburg or on Nizhni-Novgorod, or retiring
1|by a more northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kutuzov
1|afterwards took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined
1|than what he actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting
1|the troops plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a
1|garrison behind him, he quitted Moscow, approached Kutuzov without
1|joining battle, turned to the right and reached Malo-Yaroslavets,
1|again without attempting to break through and take the road Kutuzov
1|took, but retiring instead to Mozhaysk along the devastated Smolensk
1|road. Nothing more stupid than that could have been devised, or more
1|disastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon's aim been
1|to destroy his army, the most skillful strategist could hardly have
1|devised any series of actions that would so completely have
1|accomplished that purpose, independently of anything the Russian
1|army might do.
1|
1|Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he
1|destroyed his army because he wished to, or because he was very
1|stupid, would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to
1|Moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a
1|genius.
1|
1|In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the
1|personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws
1|that guided the event.
1|
1|The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon's faculties as
1|having weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did
1|not justify his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to
1|do the best he could for himself and his army, as he had done
1|previously and as he did subsequently in 1813. His activity at that
1|time was no less astounding than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in
1|Austria, and in Prussia. We do not know for certain in how far his
1|genius was genuine in Egypt--where forty centuries looked down upon
1|his grandeur--for his great exploits there are all told us by
1|Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria or
1|Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French or German
1|sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without
1|fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans to
1|recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on
1|in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius in
1|order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the
1|matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.
1|
1|His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
1|elsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued
1|by him from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The
1|absence of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of
1|Moscow, did not disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the
1|welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare
1|of the people of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or
1|of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated
1|peace.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry
1|into Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the
1|movements of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different
1|roads, and charged Murat to find Kutuzov. Then he gave careful
1|directions about the fortification of the Kremlin, and drew up a
1|brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of Russia.
1|
1|With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain
1|Yakovlev, who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how
1|to get out of Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and
1|his magnanimity, and having written a letter to the Emperor
1|Alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his Friend
1|and Brother that Rostopchin had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he
1|dispatched Yakovlev to Petersburg.
1|
1|Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to
1|Tutolmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.
1|
1|With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave
1|orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel
1|Rostopchin was punished by an order to burn down his houses.
1|
1|With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a
1|constitution. A municipality was established and the following
1|announcement issued:
1|
1|
1|INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!
1|
1|Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King
1|desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you
1|how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been
1|taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A
1|paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form
1|your municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of
1|your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished
1|by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city
1|will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only
1|wear a red ribbon round the left arm.
1|
1|The city police is established on its former footing, and better
1|order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The
1|government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of
1|police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been
1|appointed to the different wards of the city. You will recognize
1|them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several
1|churches of different denominations are open, and divine service is
1|performed in them unhindered. Your fellow citizens are returning every
1|day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find
1|in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes. These are
1|the measures the government has adopted to re-establish order and
1|relieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it is necessary that
1|you should add your efforts and should, if possible, forget the
1|misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain the hope of a less
1|cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death
1|awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains
1|of your property, and finally that you should not doubt that these
1|will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest and most
1|just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you may
1|be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of a
1|state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to
1|another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the
1|military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to
1|flow!
1|
1|
1|With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all
1|the troops in turn should enter Moscow a la maraude* to obtain
1|provisions for themselves, so that the army might have its future
1|provided for.
1|
1|
1|*As looters.
1|
1|
1|With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be
1|brought back and services to be again performed in the churches.
1|
1|With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the
1|following was placarded everywhere:
1|
1|
1|PROCLAMATION!
1|
1|You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom
1|misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of
1|the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!
1|Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being
1|restored in it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from
1|their hiding places on finding that they are respected. Any violence
1|to them or to their property is promptly punished. His Majesty the
1|Emperor and King protects them, and considers no one among you his
1|enemy except those who disobey his orders. He desires to end your
1|misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families. Respond,
1|therefore, to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear.
1|Inhabitants, return with confidence to your abodes! You will soon find
1|means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen and industrious artisans,
1|return to your work, your houses, your shops, where the protection
1|of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay for your work.
1|And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where you are
1|hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full
1|assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in
1|the city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the
1|products of the soil. The government has taken the following steps
1|to ensure freedom of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants,
1|husbandmen, and those living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without
1|any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets,
1|of which one is on the Mokhovaya Street and the other at the Provision
1|Market. (2) Such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as
1|seller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a
1|fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and
1|no one may hinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday
1|of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end
1|a sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on
1|Tuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect
1|the carts. (4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their
1|carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey.
1|(5) Steps will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.
1|
1|Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and
1|artisans, to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry
1|out the paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to
1|co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and
1|confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!
1|
1|
1|With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the
1|people, reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The
1|Emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and,
1|despite his preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the
1|theaters that were established by his order.
1|
1|In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,
1|Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma
1|Mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining
1|tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He
1|visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by
1|him to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tutolmin. Then,
1|as Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in
1|forged Russian money which he had prepared: "Raising the use of
1|these means by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let
1|relief be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food
1|was too precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part
1|enemies, Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to
1|purchase food from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them."
1|
1|With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being
1|issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military
1|duties and to suppress robbery.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans--which
1|were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances--did
1|not affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock
1|detached from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless
1|way without engaging the cogwheels.
1|
1|With reference to the military side--the plan of campaign--that work
1|of genius of which Thiers remarks that, "His genius never devised
1|anything more profound, more skillful, or more admirable," and enters
1|into a polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be
1|referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October--that plan
1|never was or could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the
1|facts of the case. The fortifying of the Kremlin, for which la Mosquee
1|(as Napoleon termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have
1|been razed to the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the
1|Kremlin only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon's wish that it should
1|be blown up when he left Moscow--as a child wants the floor on which
1|he has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army,
1|about which Napoleon was so concerned, produced an unheard-of result.
1|The French generals lost touch with the Russian army of sixty thousand
1|men, and according to Thiers it was only eventually found, like a lost
1|pin, by the skill--and apparently the genius--of Murat.
1|
1|With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's arguments as to his
1|magnanimity and justice, both to Tutolmin and to Yakovlev (whose chief
1|concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;
1|Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
1|embassage.
1|
1|With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed
1|incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.
1|
1|With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a
1|municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
1|people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
1|preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from
1|being looted.
1|
1|With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so
1|easily been settled by Napoleon's visit to a mosque, no results were
1|achieved. Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to
1|carry out Napoleon's wish, but one of them was slapped in the face
1|by a French soldier while conducting service, and a French official
1|reported of another that: "The priest whom I found and invited to
1|say Mass cleaned and locked up the church. That night the doors were
1|again broken open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and
1|other disorders perpetrated."
1|
1|With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious
1|workmen and to peasants evoked no response. There were no
1|industrious workmen, and the peasants caught the commissaries who
1|ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them.
1|
1|As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the
1|troops, these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in
1|the Kremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed again at once because
1|the actors and actresses were robbed.
1|
1|Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as
1|well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The
1|French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the
1|paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to
1|the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.
1|
1|But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders
1|given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon's attempt to stop
1|the looting and re-establish discipline.
1|
1|This is what the army authorities were reporting:
1|
1|"Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order
1|is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade
1|in a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they
1|sell stolen goods."
1|
1|"The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of
1|the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate
1|inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have
1|the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly
1|witnessed."
1|
1|"Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and
1|pillaging--October 9."
1|
1|"Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our
1|district who ought to be arrested by a strong force--October 11."
1|
1|"The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict
1|orders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually
1|seen returning to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and
1|pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening,
1|last night, and today. The Emperor sees with regret that the picked
1|soldiers appointed to guard his person, who should set an example of
1|discipline, carry disobedience to such a point that they break into
1|the cellars and stores containing army supplies. Others have disgraced
1|themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers, and
1|have abused and beaten them."
1|
1|"The Grand Marshal of the palace," wrote the governor, "complains
1|bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to
1|commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows
1|of the Emperor."
1|
1|That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot
1|the provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated
1|and perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it
1|did not go away.
1|
1|It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused
1|by the capture of transport trains on the Smolensk road, and by the
1|battle of Tarutino. The news of that battle of Tarutino,
1|unexpectedly received by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a
1|desire to punish the Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the order
1|for departure which the whole army was demanding.
1|
1|Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they
1|had stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal tresor, but
1|on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers
1|says) horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not
1|order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with
1|those of a certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the
1|caleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that
1|it was a very good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry
1|provisions, the sick, and the wounded.
1|
1|The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
1|feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the
1|skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it
1|entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
1|and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded
1|animal, hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter's gun, runs
1|forward and back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under
1|pressure from his whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the
1|battle of Tarutino frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto
1|the hunter's gun, reached him, turned back, and finally--like any wild
1|beast--ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path,
1|where the old scent was familiar.
1|
1|During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have
1|been the leader of all these movements--as the figurehead of a ship
1|may seem to a savage to guide the vessel--acted like a child who,
1|holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving
1|it.
1|

1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of
1|the shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little
1|blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped
1|about him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside
1|Karataev at night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but
1|always returned again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it
1|still belonged to nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor;
1|the soldier who told stories called it Femgalka; Karataev and others
1|called it Gray, or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name,
1|or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the
1|blue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round
1|as a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that it would often
1|gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three
1|legs, as if disdaining to use all four. Everything pleased it. Now
1|it would roll on its back, yelping with delight, now bask in the sun
1|with a thoughtful air of importance, and now frolic about playing with
1|a chip of wood or a straw.
1|
1|Pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only
1|remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier's trousers which by
1|Karataev's advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and
1|a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this
1|time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of
1|solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache
1|covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested
1|with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes
1|was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The
1|former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now
1|replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet
1|were bare.
1|
1|Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and
1|horsemen were passing that morning, then into the distance across
1|the river, then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about
1|biting him, and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in
1|various positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he
1|looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction
1|flitted across his face. The sight of them reminded him of all he
1|had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection
1|was pleasant to him.
1|
1|For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts
1|in the mornings--what is called an "old wives' summer."
1|
1|In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly
1|pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
1|the air.
1|
1|On everything--far and near--lay the magic crystal glitter seen only
1|at that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,
1|with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare
1|trees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green
1|church spire, and the corners of the white house in the distance,
1|all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with
1|unnatural clearness. Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a
1|half-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still
1|showing dark green beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled
1|house--which in dull weather was repulsively ugly--seemed quietly
1|beautiful now, in the clear, motionless brilliance.
1|
1|A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a
1|skullcap on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from
1|behind a corner of the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly
1|wink.
1|
1|"What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!" (Their name for Pierre.) "Eh?
1|Just like spring!"
1|
1|And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his
1|pipe, though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.
1|
1|"To be on the march in such weather..." he began.
1|
1|Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the
1|corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there
1|ought to be an order about the prisoners that day. Sokolov, one of the
1|soldiers in the shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the
1|corporal that something should be done about him. The corporal replied
1|that Pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a
1|permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick, and
1|that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by
1|the authorities.
1|
1|"Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the
1|captain, you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to
1|the captain when he makes his round, he will do anything for you."
1|
1|(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with
1|Pierre and showed him all sorts of favors.)
1|
1|"'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the other day. 'Monsieur Kiril
1|is a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who
1|has had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what's what.... If he
1|wants anything and asks me, he won't get a refusal. When one has
1|studied, you see, one likes education and well-bred people.' It is for
1|your sake I mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not
1|been for you that affair would have ended ill."
1|
1|And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The
1|affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before--a fight
1|between the prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had
1|succeeded in pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had
1|heard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the
1|Frenchman had said. While Pierre was repeating what he had been told
1|about the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier
1|came up to the door of the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his
1|fingers to his forehead by way of greeting, he asked Pierre whether
1|the soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that
1|shed.
1|
1|A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to
1|them, which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into
1|boots and shirts for them.
1|
1|"Ready, ready, dear fellow!" said Karataev, coming out with a neatly
1|folded shirt.
1|
1|Karataev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at
1|work, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot.
1|His hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree
1|bast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.
1|
1|"A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here
1|it is, ready," said Platon, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had
1|sewn.
1|
1|The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his
1|hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had
1|a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin
1|bare body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking
1|on would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly.
1|None of the prisoners said a word.
1|
1|"See, it fits well!" Platon kept repeating, pulling the shirt
1|straight.
1|
1|The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without
1|raising his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.
1|
1|"You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper
1|tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,"
1|said Platon with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his
1|work.
1|
1|"It's good, quite good, thank you," said the Frenchman, in French,
1|"but there must be some linen left over.
1|
1|"It will fit better still when it sets to your body," said Karataev,
1|still admiring his handiwork. "You'll be nice and comfortable...."
1|
1|"Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?" said the
1|Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note
1|and gave it to Karataev. "But give me the pieces that are over."
1|
1|Pierre saw that Platon did not want to understand what the Frenchman
1|was saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karataev thanked the
1|Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The
1|Frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over
1|and asked Pierre to translate what he said.
1|
1|"What does he want the bits for?" said Karataev. "They'd make fine
1|leg bands for us. Well, never mind."
1|
1|And Karataev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression,
1|took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
1|Frenchman without looking at him. "Oh dear!" muttered Karataev and
1|went away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment,
1|then looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre's look had told
1|him something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:
1|
1|"Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!" And handing back the
1|odd bits he turned and went out.
1|
1|"There, look at that," said Karataev, swaying his head. "People said
1|they were not Christians, but they too have souls. It's what the old
1|folk used to say: 'A sweating hand's an open hand, a dry hand's
1|close.' He's naked, but yet he's given it back."
1|
1|Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
1|pieces.
1|
1|"But they'll make grand leg bands, dear friend," he said, and went
1|back into the shed.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and
1|though the French had offered to move him from the men's to the
1|officers' shed, he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.
1|
1|In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the
1|extreme limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his
1|physical strength and health, of which he had till then been
1|unconscious, and thanks especially to the fact that the privations
1|came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began, he
1|endured his position not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this
1|time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly
1|striven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different ways that
1|tranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so impressed him in
1|the soldiers at the battle of Borodino. He had sought it in
1|philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, in
1|wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in romantic love for
1|Natasha; he had sought it by reasoning--and all these quests and
1|experiments had failed him. And now without thinking about it he had
1|found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death,
1|through privation, and through what he recognized in Karataev.
1|
1|Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as
1|it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the
1|agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important.
1|It did not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or
1|politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things
1|were no business of his, and that he was not called on to judge
1|concerning them and therefore could not do so. "Russia and summer
1|weather are not bound together," he thought, repeating words of
1|Karataev's which he found strangely consoling. His intention of
1|killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of
1|the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even
1|ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should
1|not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What
1|concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading
1|the life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and
1|especially to him, whether or not they found out that their prisoner's
1|name was Count Bezukhov?
1|
1|He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and
1|quite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew's thoughts
1|somewhat differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that
1|happiness could only be negative, but had said it with a shade of
1|bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire
1|for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and
1|never be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without any mental
1|reservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction of one's needs
1|and consequent freedom in the choice of one's occupation, that is,
1|of one's way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man's
1|highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he fully
1|appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking
1|when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth
1|when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk
1|and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one's needs--good food,
1|cleanliness, and freedom--now that he was deprived of all this, seemed
1|to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of
1|occupation, that is, of his way of life--now that that was so
1|restricted--seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a
1|superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying
1|one's needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation--such
1|freedom as his wealth, his education, and his social position had
1|given him in his own life--is just what makes the choice of occupation
1|insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of
1|having an occupation.
1|
1|All Pierre's daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free.
1|Yet subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke
1|with enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable,
1|strong, joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind
1|and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.
1|
1|When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn,
1|and saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still
1|dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills,
1|and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple
1|distance, when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the
1|noise of the crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when
1|afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun's rim appeared
1|solemnly from behind a cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the
1|hoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began to sparkle in the
1|glad light--Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he
1|had never before known. And this not only stayed with him during the
1|whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in strength as the
1|hardships of his position increased.
1|
1|That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
1|further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
1|formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge
1|of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his
1|readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance
1|of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which
1|he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut;
1|his gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still
1|and thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them
1|incomprehensible), he appeared to them a rather mysterious and
1|superior being. The very qualities that had been a hindrance, if not
1|actually harmful, to him in the world he had lived in--his strength,
1|his disdain for the comforts of life, his absent-mindedness and
1|simplicity--here among these people gave him almost the status of a
1|hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities
1|upon him.

1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and
1|seventh of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts
1|loaded, and troops and baggage trains started.
1|
1|At seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing
1|shakos and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in
1|front of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses
1|sounded all along the lines.
1|
1|In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only
1|awaited the order to start. The sick soldier, Sokolov, pale and thin
1|with dark shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot
1|and not dressed. His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his
1|face, gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention
1|to him, and he moaned regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so
1|much his sufferings that caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as
1|his fear and grief at being left alone.
1|
1|Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes
1|Karataev had made for him from some leather a French soldier had
1|torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with, went
1|up to the sick man and squatted down beside him.
1|
1|"You know, Sokolov, they are not all going away! They have a
1|hospital here. You may be better off than we others," said Pierre.
1|
1|"O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!" moaned the man
1|in a louder voice.
1|
1|"I'll go and ask them again directly," said Pierre, rising and going
1|to the door of the shed.
1|
1|Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him
1|a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal
1|and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had
1|metal straps, and these changed their familiar faces.
1|
1|The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The
1|prisoners had to be counted before being let out.
1|
1|"Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?..." Pierre began.
1|
1|But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal
1|he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
1|moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of
1|drums was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at
1|Pierre's words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door.
1|The shed became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two
1|sides drowned the sick man's groans.
1|
1|"There it is!... It again!..." said Pierre to himself, and an
1|involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal's changed
1|face, in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise
1|of the drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which
1|compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men--that
1|force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions. To
1|fear or to try to escape that force, to address entreaties or
1|exhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless. Pierre
1|knew this now. One had to wait and endure. He did not again go to
1|the sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frowning by the
1|door of the hut.
1|
1|When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one
1|another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed
1|his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal
1|had assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also
1|in marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which
1|Pierre had recognized in the corporal's words and in the roll of the
1|drums.
1|
1|"Pass on, pass on!" the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and
1|looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.
1|
1|Pierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.
1|
1|"What now?" the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
1|Pierre.
1|
1|Pierre told him about the sick man.
1|
1|"He'll manage to walk, devil take him!" said the captain. "Pass
1|on, pass on!" he continued without looking at Pierre.
1|
1|"But he is dying," Pierre again began.
1|
1|"Be so good..." shouted the captain, frowning angrily.
1|
1|"Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam..." rattled the drums, and Pierre
1|understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these
1|men and that it was now useless to say any more.
1|
1|The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to
1|march in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among
1|them, and about three hundred men.
1|
1|The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all
1|strangers to Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at
1|him and at his shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him
1|walked a fat major with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing
1|a Kazan dressing gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently
1|enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in
1|which he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing
1|gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other. Panting
1|and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he
1|thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when
1|they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something
1|when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little
1|officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now
1|being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt
1|boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side
1|and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations
1|as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city
1|was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a
1|Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was
1|mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.
1|
1|"What are you disputing about?" said the major angrily. "What does
1|it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it's
1|burned down, and there's an end of it.... What are you pushing for?
1|Isn't the road wide enough?" said he, turning to a man behind him
1|who was not pushing him at all.
1|
1|"Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?" the prisoners on one side and
1|another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. "All
1|beyond the river, and Zubova, and in the Kremlin.... Just look!
1|There's not half of it left. Yes, I told you--the whole quarter beyond
1|the river, and so it is."
1|
1|"Well, you know it's burned, so what's the use of talking?" said the
1|major.
1|
1|As they passed near a church in the Khamovniki (one of the few
1|unburned quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly
1|started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.
1|
1|"Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And
1|smeared with something!"
1|
1|Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked
1|these exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the
1|palings surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw
1|better than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set
1|upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot.
1|
1|"Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!..." the
1|convoy guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh
1|virulence, drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who
1|were gazing at the dead man.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|Through the cross streets of the Khamovniki quarter the prisoners
1|marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
1|belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they
1|came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
1|private vehicles.
1|
1|At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get
1|across. From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving
1|baggage trains before and behind them. To the right, where the
1|Kaluga road turns near Neskuchny, endless rows of troops and carts
1|stretched away into the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais'
1|corps which had started before any of the others. Behind, along the
1|riverside and across the Stone Bridge, were Ney's troops and
1|transport.
1|
1|Davout's troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing
1|the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kaluga
1|road. But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of
1|Beauharnais' train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the
1|Kaluga road when the vanguard of Ney's army was already emerging
1|from the Great Ordynka Street.
1|
1|When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few
1|steps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles
1|and men crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few
1|hundred paces that separated the bridge from the Kaluga road, taking
1|more than an hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the
1|streets of the Transmoskva ward and the Kaluga road converge, and
1|the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at
1|that crossway. From all sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard
1|the rattle of wheels, the tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger
1|and abuse. Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house,
1|listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll
1|of the drums.
1|
1|To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the
1|wall of the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.
1|
1|"What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They've loaded goods
1|even on the cannon! Look there, those are furs!" they exclaimed. "Just
1|see what the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one
1|has behind in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some
1|icons, by heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has
1|loaded himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they've even grabbed
1|those chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks....
1|Heavens! They're fighting."
1|
1|"That's right, hit him on the snout--on his snout! Like this, we
1|shan't get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be
1|Napoleon's own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown!
1|It's like a portable house.... That fellow's dropped his sack and
1|doesn't see it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not
1|bad-looking either! Yes, I dare say, that's the way they'll let you
1|pass... Just look, there's no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven,
1|so they are! In carriages--see how comfortably they've settled
1|themselves!"
1|
1|Again, as at the church in Khamovniki, a wave of general curiosity
1|bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to
1|his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted
1|their curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts,
1|closely squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in
1|glaring colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.
1|
1|From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the
1|mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful:
1|neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women
1|hurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now
1|witnessed scarcely made an impression on him--as if his soul, making
1|ready for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might
1|weaken it.
1|
1|The women's vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts,
1|soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers,
1|ammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women.
1|
1|Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.
1|
1|All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some
1|invisible power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came
1|flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get
1|on quickly; they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to
1|fight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of
1|abuse flew from side to side, and all the faces bore the same
1|swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck
1|Pierre that morning on the corporal's face when the drums were
1|beating.
1|
1|It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the
1|escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way
1|in among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all
1|sides, emerged onto the Kaluga road.
1|
1|They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the
1|sun began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men
1|began to prepare for their night's rest. They all appeared angry and
1|dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could
1|be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran
1|into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole.
1|Several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat
1|the carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others
1|fought among themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly
1|wounded on the head by a sword.
1|
1|It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid
1|fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and
1|the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and
1|eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start. Once at a
1|standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know
1|where they were going, and that much that was painful and difficult
1|awaited them on this journey.
1|
1|During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than
1|they had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the
1|first time received horseflesh for their meat ration.
1|
1|From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what
1|seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners, in
1|unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations.
1|
1|This spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of
1|prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one
1|Russian soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had
1|escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for
1|straying too far from the road, and heard his friend the captain
1|reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on
1|account of the escape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned officer's
1|excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk, the officer
1|replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind. Pierre
1|felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the
1|executions, but which he had not felt during his imprisonment, now
1|again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt that in
1|proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him, there grew
1|and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it.
1|
1|He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with
1|his comrades.
1|
1|Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen
1|in Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of
1|the order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in
1|reaction against the worsening of their position they were all
1|particularly animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences,
1|of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and
1|avoided all talk of their present situation.
1|
1|The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in
1|the sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon
1|from the rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely
1|in the gray haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night
1|had not yet come. Pierre got up and left his new companions,
1|crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where
1|he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed. He
1|wanted to talk to them. On the road he was stopped by a French
1|sentinel who ordered him back.
1|
1|Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an
1|unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him
1|and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of
1|the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought.
1|Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured
1|laughter, so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise
1|to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean.
1|
1|"Ha-ha-ha!" laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: "The
1|soldier did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me
1|captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!..." and
1|he laughed till tears started to his eyes.
1|
1|A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing
1|at all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther
1|away from the inquisitive man, and looked around him.
1|
1|The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
1|crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the
1|red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the
1|light sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp,
1|unseen before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still,
1|beyond those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless
1|distance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the
1|twinkling stars in its faraway depths. "And all that is me, all that
1|is within me, and it is all I!" thought Pierre. "And they caught all
1|that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks!" He smiled, and
1|went and lay down to sleep beside his companions.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutuzov with a
1|letter from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow,
1|though Napoleon was already not far from Kutuzov on the old Kaluga
1|road. Kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one
1|formerly brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no
1|question of peace.
1|
1|Soon after that a report was received from Dorokhov's guerrilla
1|detachment operating to the left of Tarutino that troops of
1|Broussier's division had been seen at Forminsk and that being
1|separated from the rest of the French army they might easily be
1|destroyed. The soldiers and officers again demanded action. Generals
1|on the staff, excited by the memory of the easy victory at Tarutino,
1|urged Kutuzov to carry out Dorokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov did not
1|consider any offensive necessary. The result was a compromise which
1|was inevitable: a small detachment was sent to Forminsk to attack
1|Broussier.
1|
1|By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most
1|difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhturov--that same
1|modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing
1|up plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering
1|crosses on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was
1|spoken of as undecided and undiscerning--but whom we find commanding
1|wherever the position was most difficult all through the
1|Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he
1|remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what
1|was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single
1|general was left in the rear guard. Ill with fever he went to Smolensk
1|with twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon's whole
1|army. In Smolensk, at the Malakhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in
1|a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the
1|town--and Smolensk held out all day long. At the battle of Borodino,
1|when Bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank
1|had fallen and the full force of the French artillery fire was
1|directed against it, the man sent there was this same irresolute and
1|undiscerning Dokhturov--Kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he
1|had made by sending someone else there first. And the quiet little
1|Dokhturov rode thither, and Borodino became the greatest glory of
1|the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to us in verse and
1|prose, but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said.
1|
1|It was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from there
1|to Malo-Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle with the French
1|was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army
1|began; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of
1|the campaign, but of Dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that
1|dubiously. And this silence about Dokhturov is the clearest
1|testimony to his merit.
1|
1|It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
1|machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance
1|and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
1|important part. The man who does not understand the construction of
1|the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
1|revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine,
1|and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.
1|
1|On the tenth of October when Dokhturov had gone halfway to
1|Forminsk and stopped at the village of Aristovo, preparing
1|faithfully to execute the orders he had received, the whole French
1|army having, in its convulsive movement, reached Murat's position
1|apparently in order to give battle--suddenly without any reason turned
1|off to the left onto the new Kaluga road and began to enter
1|Forminsk, where only Broussier had been till then. At that time
1|Dokhturov had under his command, besides Dorokhov's detachment, the
1|two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslavin.
1|
1|On the evening of October 11 Seslavin came to the Aristovo
1|headquarters with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner
1|said that the troops that had entered Forminsk that day were the
1|vanguard of the whole army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army
1|had left Moscow four days previously. That same evening a house serf
1|who had come from Borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering
1|the town. Some Cossacks of Dokhturov's detachment reported having
1|sighted the French Guards marching along the road to Borovsk. From all
1|these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a
1|single division there was now the whole French army marching from
1|Moscow in an unexpected direction--along the Kaluga road. Dokhturov
1|was unwilling to undertake any action, as it was not clear to him
1|now what he ought to do. He had been ordered to attack Forminsk. But
1|only Broussier had been there at that time and now the whole French
1|army was there. Ermolov wished to act on his own judgment, but
1|Dokhturov insisted that he must have Kutuzov's instructions. So it was
1|decided to send a dispatch to the staff.
1|
1|For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovitinov, was chosen, who
1|was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering a
1|written report. Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov, having received the
1|dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff
1|accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four
1|days. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour
1|and a half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka
1|after one o'clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle
1|fence hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he
1|entered a dark passage.
1|
1|"The general on duty, quick! It's very important!" said he to
1|someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.
1|
1|"He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third
1|night he has not slept," said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper.
1|"You should wake the captain first."
1|
1|"But this is very important, from General Dokhturov," said
1|Bolkhovitinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
1|the dark.
1|
1|The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.
1|
1|"Your honor, your honor! A courier."
1|
1|"What? What's that? From whom?" came a sleepy voice.
1|
1|"From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich. Napoleon is at Forminsk,"
1|said Bolkhovitinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
1|guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn.
1|
1|The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.
1|
1|"I don't like waking him," he said, fumbling for something. "He is
1|very ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor."
1|
1|"Here is the dispatch," said Bolkhovitinov. "My orders are to give
1|it at once to the general on duty."
1|
1|"Wait a moment, I'll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you
1|always hide it?" said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,
1|to the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, Konovnitsyn's adjutant.)
1|"I've found it, I've found it!" he added.
1|
1|The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was fumbling for
1|something on the candlestick.
1|
1|"Oh, the nasty beasts!" said he with disgust.
1|
1|By the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw Shcherbinin's
1|youthful face as he held the candle, and the face of another man who
1|was still asleep. This was Konovnitsyn.
1|
1|When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned
1|up, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, from
1|the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
1|running away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovitinov was
1|bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it
1|with his sleeve.
1|
1|"Who gave the report?" inquired Shcherbinin, taking the envelope.
1|
1|"The news is reliable," said Bolkhovitinov. "Prisoners, Cossacks,
1|and the scouts all say the same thing."
1|
1|"There's nothing to be done, we'll have to wake him," said
1|Shcherbinin, rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay
1|covered by a greatcoat. "Peter Petrovich!" said he. (Konovnitsyn did
1|not stir.) "To the General Staff!" he said with a smile, knowing
1|that those words would be sure to arouse him.
1|
1|And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On
1|Konovnitsyn's handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,
1|there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
1|from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face
1|assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance.
1|
1|"Well, what is it? From whom?" he asked immediately but without
1|hurry, blinking at the light.
1|
1|While listening to the officer's report Konovnitsyn broke the seal
1|and read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his
1|legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began
1|putting on his boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair
1|over his temples, and donned his cap.
1|
1|"Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness."
1|
1|Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of
1|great importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or
1|ask himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest
1|him. He regarded the whole business of the war not with his
1|intelligence or his reason but by something else. There was within him
1|a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well, but that one
1|must not trust to this and still less speak about it, but must only
1|attend to one's own work. And he did his work, giving his whole
1|strength to the task.
1|
1|Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn, like Dokhturov, seems to have been
1|included merely for propriety's sake in the list of the so-called
1|heroes of 1812--the Barclays, Raevskis, Ermolovs, Platovs, and
1|Miloradoviches. Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of
1|very limited capacity and information, and like Dokhturov he never
1|made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most
1|difficult. Since his appointment as general on duty he had always
1|slept with his door open, giving orders that every messenger should be
1|allowed to wake him up. In battle he was always under fire, so that
1|Kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front, and
1|like Dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that, without
1|clatter or noise, constitute the most essential part of the machine.
1|
1|Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnitsyn
1|frowned--partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the
1|unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of
1|influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,
1|especially Bennigsen, who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers
1|drawn with Kutuzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel,
1|issue orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable
1|to him though he knew it could not be helped.
1|
1|And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news,
1|immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his
1|quarters, until Konovnitsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded
1|him that they must go to see his Highness.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often
1|fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his
1|bed without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.
1|
1|So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred
1|head on his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and
1|peering into the darkness.
1|
1|Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more
1|influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him,
1|Kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his
1|troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The
1|lesson of the Tarutino battle and of the day before it, which
1|Kutuzov remembered with pain, must, he thought, have some effect on
1|others too.
1|
1|"They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.
1|Patience and time are my warriors, my champions," thought Kutuzov.
1|He knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will
1|fall of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled,
1|the tree is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an
1|experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded, and
1|wounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it,
1|but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided
1|question. Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barthelemi having been
1|sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kutuzov was almost sure
1|that the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs and it was
1|necessary to wait.
1|
1|"They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall
1|see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!" thought he. "What
1|for? Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are
1|like children from whom one can't get any sensible account of what has
1|happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But
1|that's not what is needed now.
1|
1|"And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to
1|them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies" (he
1|remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) "they have
1|foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless."
1|
1|The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodino
1|was mortal or not had hung over Kutuzov's head for a whole month. On
1|the one hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutuzov felt
1|assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and
1|all the Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal.
1|But in any case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for
1|them and grew more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed
1|during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those
1|younger generals for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible
1|contingencies, just like the younger men, but with this difference,
1|that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and
1|based nothing on them. The longer he thought the more contingencies
1|presented themselves. He imagined all sorts of movements of the
1|Napoleonic army as a whole or in sections--against Petersburg, or
1|against him, or to outflank him. He thought too of the possibility
1|(which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his
1|own weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutuzov even imagined
1|that Napoleon's army might turn back through Medyn and Yukhnov, but
1|the one thing he could not foresee was what happened--the insane,
1|convulsive stampede of Napoleon's army during its first eleven days
1|after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what Kutuzov
1|had not yet even dared to think of--the complete extermination of
1|the French. Dorokhov's report about Broussier's division, the
1|guerrillas' reports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors of
1|preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that
1|the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were
1|only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not
1|to Kutuzov. With his sixty years' experience he knew what value to
1|attach to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group
1|all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew
1|how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary.
1|And the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe
1|it. This question absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to
1|him only life's customary routine. To such customary routine
1|belonged his conversations with the staff, the letters he wrote from
1|Tarutino to Madame de Stael, the reading of novels, the distribution
1|of awards, his correspondence with Petersburg, and so on. But the
1|destruction of the French, which he alone foresaw, was his heart's one
1|desire.
1|
1|On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm
1|and thinking of that.
1|
1|There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,
1|Konovnitsyn, and Bolkhovitinov.
1|
1|"Eh, who's there? Come in, come in! What news?" the field marshal
1|called out to them.
1|
1|While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the
1|substance of the news.
1|
1|"Who brought it?" asked Kutuzov with a look which, when the candle
1|was lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.
1|
1|"There can be no doubt about it, your Highness."
1|
1|"Call him in, call him here."
1|
1|Kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big
1|paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him. He
1|screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more
1|carefully, as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his
1|own mind.
1|
1|"Tell me, tell me, friend," said he to Bolkhovitinov in his low,
1|aged voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his
1|chest, "come nearer--nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That
1|Napoleon has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?"
1|
1|Bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he
1|had been told to report.
1|
1|"Speak quicker, quicker! Don't torture me!" Kutuzov interrupted him.
1|
1|Bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
1|instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutuzov
1|checked him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered
1|and wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side
1|of the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.
1|
1|"O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer..." said he in a
1|tremulous voice with folded hands. "Russia is saved. I thank Thee, O
1|Lord!" and he wept.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all
1|Kutuzov's activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by
1|authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks, maneuvers,
1|or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokhturov went to
1|Malo-Yaroslavets, but Kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave
1|orders for the evacuation of Kaluga--a retreat beyond which town
1|seemed to him quite possible.
1|
1|Everywhere Kutuzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for
1|his retreat fled in the opposite direction.
1|
1|Napoleon's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at
1|Tarutino and Malo-Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what would
1|have happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich
1|southern provinces.
1|
1|But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from
1|advancing into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did
1|not bar his way), the historians forget that nothing could have
1|saved his army, for then already it bore within itself the germs of
1|inevitable ruin. How could that army--which had found abundant
1|supplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of
1|keeping them, and on arriving at Smolensk had looted provisions
1|instead of storing them--how could that army recuperate in Kaluga
1|province, which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived in
1|Moscow, and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set
1|ablaze?
1|
1|That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodino
1|and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were,
1|the chemical elements of dissolution.
1|
1|The members of what had once been an army--Napoleon himself and
1|all his soldiers fled--without knowing whither, each concerned only to
1|make his escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the
1|hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.
1|
1|So it came about that at the council at Malo-Yaroslavets, when the
1|generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all
1|mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier
1|Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing
1|needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not even
1|Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all
1|recognized.
1|
1|But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away,
1|there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must
1|flee. An external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this
1|shock came in due time. It was what the French called "le hourra de
1|l'Empereur."
1|
1|The day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode out
1|early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of
1|marshals and an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and
1|the scene of the previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks
1|on the prowl for booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly
1|captured him. If the Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what
1|saved him was the very thing that was destroying the French army,
1|the booty on which the Cossacks fell. Here as at Tarutino they went
1|after plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed
1|after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape.
1|
1|When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor
1|himself in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was
1|nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest,
1|familiar road. Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood
1|that hint, not feeling his former agility and boldness, and under
1|the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once
1|agreed with Mouton and issued orders--as the historians tell us--to
1|retreat by the Smolensk road.
1|
1|That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated,
1|does not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces
1|which influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk
1|(that is, the Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on him also.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to
1|go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him
1|at the end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a
1|promised land to have the strength to move.
1|
1|The promised land for the French during their advance had been
1|Moscow, during their retreat it was their native land. But that native
1|land was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is
1|absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to
1|himself: "Today I shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I
1|shall rest and spend the night," and during the first day's journey
1|that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his
1|hopes and desires. And the impulses felt by a single person are always
1|magnified in a crowd.
1|
1|For the French retreating along the old Smolensk road, the final
1|goal--their native land--was too remote, and their immediate goal
1|was Smolensk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously
1|intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that
1|much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolensk, nor that they
1|were told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon
1|himself, knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this
1|alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present
1|privations. So both those who knew and those who did not know deceived
1|themselves, and pushed on to Smolensk as to a promised land.
1|
1|Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising
1|energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on.
1|Besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French
1|into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy, there was
1|another cause binding them together--their great numbers. As with
1|the physical law of gravity, their enormous mass drew the individual
1|human atoms to itself. In their hundreds of thousands they moved
1|like a whole nation.
1|
1|Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a
1|prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one
1|hand the force of this common attraction to Smolensk, their goal, drew
1|each of them in the same direction; on the other hand an army corps
1|could not surrender to a company, and though the French availed
1|themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to
1|surrender on the slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not
1|always occur. Their very numbers and their crowded and swift
1|movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only
1|difficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this movement, to
1|which the French were directing all their energies. Beyond a certain
1|limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of
1|decomposition.
1|
1|A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a
1|certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt
1|the snow. On the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the
1|remaining snow becomes.
1|
1|Of the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone understood this. When the
1|flight of the French army along the Smolensk road became well defined,
1|what Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of
1|October began to occur. The superior officers all wanted to
1|distinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to
1|overthrow the French, and all clamored for action.
1|
1|Kutuzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited
1|in the case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.
1|
1|He could not tell them what we say now: "Why fight, why block the
1|road, losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate
1|wretches? What is the use of that, when a third of their army has
1|melted away on the road from Moscow to Vyazma without any battle?" But
1|drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand, he told
1|them of the golden bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him,
1|flinging themselves on, rending and exulting over the dying beast.
1|
1|Ermolov, Miloradovich, Platov, and others in proximity to the French
1|near Vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up
1|two French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kutuzov
1|they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.
1|
1|And try as Kutuzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,
1|trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to
1|the attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost
1|thousands of men.
1|
1|But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,
1|closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily
1|melting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smolensk.

1|BOOK FOURTEEN: 1812
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|The Battle of Borodino, with the occupation of Moscow that
1|followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is
1|one of the most instructive phenomena in history.
1|
1|All historians agree that the external activity of states and
1|nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars,
1|and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the
1|political strength of states and nations increases or decreases.
1|
1|Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,
1|having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy's
1|army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and
1|subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all the
1|facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the
1|statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against
1|another is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an
1|increase or decrease in the strength of the nation--even though it is
1|unintelligible why the defeat of an army--a hundredth part of a
1|nation--should oblige that whole nation to submit. An army gains a
1|victory, and at once the rights of the conquering nation have
1|increased to the detriment of the defeated. An army has suffered
1|defeat, and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the
1|severity of the reverse, and if its army suffers a complete defeat the
1|nation is quite subjugated.
1|
1|So according to history it has been found from the most ancient
1|times, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon's wars serve to
1|confirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army
1|Austria loses its rights, and the rights and the strength of France
1|increase. The victories of the French at Jena and Auerstadt destroy
1|the independent existence of Prussia.
1|
1|But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow
1|is taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia
1|that ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and
1|then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of
1|history: to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the
1|hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles
1|that destroyed Napoleon's army, is impossible.
1|
1|After the French victory at Borodino there was no general engagement
1|nor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist.
1|What does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of
1|China, we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is
1|the historians' usual expedient when anything does not fit their
1|standards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which
1|only a small number of troops took part, we might treat it as an
1|exception; but this event occurred before our fathers' eyes, and for
1|them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland, and
1|it happened in the greatest of all known wars.
1|
1|The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodino to
1|the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does
1|not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of
1|conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples
1|lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in
1|something else.
1|
1|The French historians, describing the condition of the French army
1|before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,
1|except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport--there was no
1|forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one
1|could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather
1|than let the French have it.
1|
1|The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the
1|peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow
1|drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally
1|failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable
1|multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for
1|the high price offered them, but burned it instead.
1|
1|Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with
1|rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The
1|fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants,
1|feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke
1|but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first
1|cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine
1|that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest
1|means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by
1|traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case,
1|insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to
1|all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity
1|would result from such an account of the duel.
1|
1|The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of
1|fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier
1|and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to
1|explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the
1|historians who have described the event.
1|
1|After the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow any
1|previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the
1|retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodino and the renewed
1|retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the
1|seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures
1|from the rules.
1|
1|Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing
1|attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent's rapier saw a cudgel
1|raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutuzov and
1|to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to
1|all the rules--as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite
1|of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the
1|rules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it
1|seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to
1|assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and
1|to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on--the cudgel of the
1|people's war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength,
1|and without consulting anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of
1|anything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but
1|consistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had
1|perished.
1|
1|And it is well for a people who do not--as the French did in 1813--salute
1|according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their
1|rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,
1|but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have adopted
1|in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to
1|hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in
1|their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the
1|so-called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men
1|pressed together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that
1|take on a national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds
1|opposing each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when
1|attacked by stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers.
1|This was done by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in
1|the Caucasus, and by the Russians in 1812.
1|
1|People have called this kind of war "guerrilla warfare" and assume
1|that by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a
1|war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a
1|well-known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That
1|rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to
1|be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict.
1|
1|Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly
1|infringes that rule.
1|
1|This contradiction arises from the fact that military science
1|assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers.
1|Military science says that the more troops the greater the strength.
1|Les gros bataillons ont toujours raison.*
1|
1|
1|*Large battalions are always victorious.
1|
1|
1|For military science to say this is like defining momentum in
1|mechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are
1|equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved
1|are equal or unequal.
1|
1|Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.
1|
1|In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its
1|mass and some unknown x.
1|
1|Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the
1|fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and
1|that small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the
1|existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it--now in a
1|geometric formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most
1|usually, in the genius of the commanders. But the assignment of
1|these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which
1|accord with the historic facts.
1|
1|Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to
1|gratify the "heroes") of the efficacy of the directions issued in
1|wartime by commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.
1|
1|That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the
1|greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the
1|men composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are
1|not, fighting under the command of a genius, in two--or three-line
1|formation, with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a
1|minute. Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most
1|advantageous conditions for fighting.
1|
1|The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass
1|gives the resulting force. To define and express the significance of
1|this unknown factor--the spirit of an army--is a problem for science.
1|
1|This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to
1|substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that
1|force becomes apparent--such as the commands of the general, the
1|equipment employed, and so on--mistaking these for the real
1|significance of the factor, and if we recognize this unknown
1|quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to
1|fight and to face danger. Only then, expressing known historic facts
1|by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor,
1|can we hope to define the unknown.
1|
1|Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions,
1|or divisions, conquer--that is, kill or take captive--all the
1|others, while themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and
1|on the other fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to
1|the fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This
1|equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us
1|a ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected
1|historic units (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such
1|equations, a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws
1|should exist and might be discovered.
1|
1|The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when
1|attacking, and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms
1|the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To
1|lead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by
1|movement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But
1|this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army
1|continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking
1|contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of
1|the troops occurs, as in all national wars.
1|
1|The French, retreating in 1812--though according to tactics they should
1|have separated into detachments to defend themselves--congregated into a
1|mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
1|held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according
1|to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up into
1|small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate
1|individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing
1|any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
1|dangers.

1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into
1|Smolensk.
1|
1|Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
1|government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had
1|been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off
1|as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denis
1|Davydov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the
1|value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of
1|military science destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit
1|for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare.
1|
1|On August 24 Davydov's first partisan detachment was formed and then
1|others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more
1|numerous these detachments became.
1|
1|The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the
1|fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree--the
1|French army--and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when
1|the French were fleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds of such
1|companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that
1|adopted all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and
1|the comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry.
1|There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of
1|peasants and landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded
1|one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a
1|month; and there was Vasilisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew
1|hundreds of the French.
1|
1|The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
1|October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,
1|amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded and
1|captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,
1|hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the
1|end of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had
1|become clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what
1|could not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and
1|moving according to rules at a distance from the French, still
1|regarded many things as impossible. The small bands that had started
1|their activities long before and had already observed the French
1|closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big
1|detachments did not dare to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who
1|crept in among the French now considered everything possible.
1|
1|On October 22, Denisov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his
1|group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning
1|he and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been
1|watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French
1|convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the
1|rest of the army, which--as was learned from spies and prisoners--was
1|moving under a strong escort to Smolensk. Besides Denisov and Dolokhov
1|(who also led a small party and moved in Denisov's vicinity), the
1|commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this
1|convoy and, as Denisov expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for
1|it. Two of the commanders of large parties--one a Pole and the other a
1|German--sent invitations to Denisov almost simultaneously, requesting
1|him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy.
1|
1|"No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself," said Denisov on
1|reading these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite
1|his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general,
1|he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command
1|of the Polish general. To the Polish general he replied to the same
1|effect, informing him that he was already under the command of the
1|German.
1|
1|Having arranged matters thus, Denisov and Dolokhov intended, without
1|reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that
1|convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from
1|the village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo. To the left of the road
1|between Mikulino and Shamshevo there were large forests, extending in
1|some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back
1|from it. Through these forests Denisov and his party rode all day,
1|sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very
1|edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,
1|Cossacks of Denisov's party had seized and carried off into the forest
1|two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not
1|far from Mikulino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,
1|and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French
1|without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Shamshevo
1|quietly without alarming them and then, after joining Dolokhov who was
1|to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman's hut in the
1|forest less than a mile from Shamshevo, to surprise the French at
1|dawn, falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and
1|rout and capture them all at one blow.
1|
1|In their rear, more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest
1|came right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any
1|fresh columns of French should show themselves.
1|
1|Beyond Shamshevo, Dolokhov was to observe the road in the same
1|way, to find out at what distance there were other French troops. They
1|reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denisov had two
1|hundred, and Dolokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of
1|numbers did not deter Denisov. All that he now wanted to know was what
1|troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a "tongue"--that
1|is, a man from the enemy column. That morning's attack on the wagons
1|had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all
1|been killed; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he
1|was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops
1|in that column.
1|
1|Denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear
1|of putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tikhon
1|Shcherbaty, a peasant of his party, to Shamshevo to try and seize at
1|least one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on in
1|advance.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both
1|the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and
1|then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.
1|
1|Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain
1|ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides.
1|Like his horse, which turned its head and laid its ears back, he
1|shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him. His
1|thin face with its short, thick black beard looked angry.
1|
1|Beside Denisov rode an esaul,* Denisov's fellow worker, also in felt
1|cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.
1|
1|
1|*A captain of Cossacks.
1|
1|
1|Esaul Lovayski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,
1|pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm
1|self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to
1|say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first
1|glance at the esaul and Denisov one saw that the latter was wet and
1|uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the
1|esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always
1|and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was
1|one with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold
1|strength.
1|
1|A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and
1|wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.
1|
1|A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghiz mount with an
1|enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a
1|blue French overcoat.
1|
1|Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform
1|and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on
1|to the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed
1|about him with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that
1|morning.
1|
1|Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars
1|in threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in
1|French greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The
1|horses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether
1|chestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes,
1|looked strangely thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles,
1|reins, were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the
1|fallen leaves that strewed the road. The men sat huddled up trying not
1|to stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and
1|not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their
1|seats, their knees, and at the back of their necks. In the midst of
1|the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons, drawn by French horses
1|and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front,
1|rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the
1|water that lay in the ruts.
1|
1|Denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and
1|bumped his rider's knee against a tree.
1|
1|"Oh, the devil!" exclaimed Denisov angrily, and showing his teeth he
1|struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and
1|his comrades with mud.
1|
1|Denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from
1|hunger (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more
1|because he still had no news from Dolokhov and the man sent to capture
1|a "tongue" had not returned.
1|
1|"There'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as
1|today. It's too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it
1|off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will
1|snatch the prey from under our noses," thought Denisov, continually
1|peering forward, hoping to see a messenger from Dolokhov.
1|
1|On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to
1|the right, Denisov stopped.
1|
1|"There's someone coming," said he.
1|
1|The esaul looked in the direction Denisov indicated.
1|
1|"There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not
1|presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself," said the
1|esaul, who was fond of using words the Cossacks did not know.
1|
1|The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
1|visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary
1|gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and
1|drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,
1|standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young
1|lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denisov
1|and handed him a sodden envelope.
1|
1|"From the general," said the officer. "Please excuse its not being
1|quite dry."
1|
1|Denisov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.
1|
1|"There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, it's dangerous,'"
1|said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading the
1|dispatch. "But Komarov and I"--he pointed to the Cossack--"were
1|prepared. We have each of us two pistols.... But what's this?" he
1|asked, noticing the French drummer boy. "A prisoner? You've already
1|been in action? May I speak to him?"
1|
1|"Wostov! Petya!" exclaimed Denisov, having run through the dispatch.
1|"Why didn't you say who you were?" and turning with a smile he held
1|out his hand to the lad.
1|
1|The officer was Petya Rostov.
1|
1|All the way Petya had been preparing himself to behave with
1|Denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer--without hinting at
1|their previous acquaintance. But as soon as Denisov smiled at him
1|Petya brightened up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner
1|he had been rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already
1|been in a battle near Vyazma and how a certain hussar had
1|distinguished himself there.
1|
1|"Well, I am glad to see you," Denisov interrupted him, and his
1|face again assumed its anxious expression.
1|
1|"Michael Feoklitych," said he to the esaul, "this is again fwom that
1|German, you know. He"--he indicated Petya--"is serving under him."
1|
1|And Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
1|repetition of the German general's demand that he should join forces
1|with him for an attack on the transport.
1|
1|"If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch it fwom under our
1|noses," he added.
1|
1|While Denisov was talking to the esaul, Petya--abashed by
1|Denisov's cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition
1|of his trousers--furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat
1|so that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air
1|as possible.
1|
1|"Will there be any orders, your honor?" he asked Denisov, holding
1|his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general
1|for which he had prepared himself, "or shall I remain with your
1|honor?"
1|
1|"Orders?" Denisov repeated thoughtfully. "But can you stay till
1|tomowwow?"
1|
1|"Oh, please... May I stay with you?" cried Petya.
1|
1|"But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?"
1|asked Denisov.
1|
1|Petya blushed.
1|
1|"He gave me no instructions. I think I could?" he returned,
1|inquiringly.
1|
1|"Well, all wight," said Denisov.
1|
1|And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting
1|place arranged near the watchman's hut in the forest, and told the
1|officer on the Kirghiz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant)
1|to go and find out where Dolokhov was and whether he would come that
1|evening. Denisov himself intended going with the esaul and Petya to
1|the edge of the forest where it reached out to Shamshevo, to have a
1|look at the part of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.
1|
1|"Well, old fellow," said he to the peasant guide, "lead us to
1|Shamshevo."
1|
1|Denisov, Petya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and
1|the hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to
1|the edge of the forest.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from
1|the trees. Denisov, the esaul, and Petya rode silently, following
1|the peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned
1|toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet
1|leaves, silently led them to the edge of the forest.
1|
1|He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to
1|where the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree
1|that had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously
1|to them with his hand.
1|
1|Denisov and Petya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant
1|was standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest,
1|on a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a
1|steep ravine, was a small village and a landowner's house with a
1|broken roof. In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well,
1|by the pond, over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill
1|from the bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred
1|yards away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist.
1|Their un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining
1|uphill with the carts, and their calls to one another, could be
1|clearly heard.
1|
1|"Bwing the prisoner here," said Denisov in a low voice, not taking
1|his eyes off the French.
1|
1|A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to
1|Denisov. Pointing to the French troops, Denisov asked him what these
1|and those of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his
1|pockets and lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denisov in affright, but
1|in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused
1|answers, merely assenting to everything Denisov asked him. Denisov
1|turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his
1|own conjectures to him.
1|
1|Petya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy,
1|now at Denisov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village
1|and along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.
1|
1|"Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?" said
1|Denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes.
1|
1|"It is a very suitable spot," said the esaul.
1|
1|"We'll send the infantwy down by the swamps," Denisov continued.
1|"They'll cweep up to the garden; you'll wide up fwom there with the
1|Cossacks"--he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village--"and
1|I with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot..."
1|
1|"The hollow is impassable--there's a swamp there," said the esaul.
1|"The horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left...."
1|
1|While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded
1|from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared,
1|then another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French
1|voices shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment
1|Denisov and the esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought
1|they were the cause of the firing and shouting. But the firing and
1|shouting did not relate to them. Down below, a man wearing something
1|red was running through the marsh. The French were evidently firing
1|and shouting at him.
1|
1|"Why, that's our Tikhon," said the esaul.
1|
1|"So it is! It is!"
1|
1|"The wascal!" said Denisov.
1|
1|"He'll get away!" said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.
1|
1|The man whom they called Tikhon, having run to the stream, plunged
1|in so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared
1|for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet,
1|and ran on. The French who had been pursuing him stopped.
1|
1|"Smart, that!" said the esaul.
1|
1|"What a beast!" said Denisov with his former look of vexation. "What
1|has he been doing all this time?"
1|
1|"Who is he?" asked Petya.
1|
1|"He's our plastun. I sent him to capture a 'tongue.'"
1|
1|"Oh, yes," said Petya, nodding at the first words Denisov uttered as
1|if he understood it all, though he really did not understand
1|anything of it.
1|
1|Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their
1|band. He was a peasant from Pokrovsk, near the river Gzhat. When
1|Denisov had come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and
1|had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew
1|about the French, the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied,
1|as all village elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything
1|of them. But when Denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the
1|French, and asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied
1|that some "more-orderers" had really been at their village, but that
1|Tikhon Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters.
1|Denisov had Tikhon called and, having praised him for his activity,
1|said a few words in the elder's presence about loyalty to the Tsar and
1|the country and the hatred of the French that all sons of the
1|fatherland should cherish.
1|
1|"We don't do the French any harm," said Tikhon, evidently frightened
1|by Denisov's words. "We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you
1|know! We killed a score or so of 'more-orderers,' but we did no harm
1|else..."
1|
1|Next day when Denisov had left Pokrovsk, having quite forgotten
1|about this peasant, it was reported to him that Tikhon had attached
1|himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it.
1|Denisov gave orders to let him do so.
1|
1|Tikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching
1|water, flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking
1|and aptitude for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for
1|booty and always brought back French clothing and weapons, and when
1|told to would bring in French captives also. Denisov then relieved him
1|from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on
1|expeditions and had him enrolled among the Cossacks.
1|
1|Tikhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging
1|behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried
1|rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf
1|uses its teeth, with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or
1|crunching thick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs
1|with blows at arm's length, or holding the head of the ax would cut
1|thin little pegs or carve spoons. In Denisov's party he held a
1|peculiar and exceptional position. When anything particularly
1|difficult or nasty had to be done--to push a cart out of the mud
1|with one's shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail, skin
1|it, slink in among the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a
1|day--everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon.
1|
1|"It won't hurt that devil--he's as strong as a horse!" they said
1|of him.
1|
1|Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him
1|and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which Tikhon
1|treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the
1|subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment--jokes in which
1|Tikhon readily joined.
1|
1|"Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?" the Cossacks would
1|banter him. And Tikhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended
1|to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only
1|effect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he
1|seldom brought in prisoners.
1|
1|He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found
1|more opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more
1|Frenchmen, and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the
1|Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been
1|sent by Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a "tongue." But
1|whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman
1|or because he had slept through the night, he had crept by day into
1|some bushes right among the French and, as Denisov had witnessed
1|from above, had been detected by them.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|After talking for some time with the esaul about next day's
1|attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he
1|seemed to have definitely decided on, Denisov turned his horse and
1|rode back.
1|
1|"Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy," he said to Petya.
1|
1|As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped, peering into the
1|forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,
1|wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan hat, was approaching
1|with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
1|stuck in his girdle. When he espied Denisov he hastily threw something
1|into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and
1|approached his commander. It was Tikhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked
1|face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He
1|lifted his head high and gazed at Denisov as if repressing a laugh.
1|
1|"Well, where did you disappear to?" inquired Denisov.
1|
1|"Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen," answered Tikhon
1|boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.
1|
1|"Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well,
1|why haven't you taken one?"
1|
1|"Oh, I took one all right," said Tikhon.
1|
1|"Where is he?"
1|
1|"You see, I took him first thing at dawn," Tikhon continued,
1|spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes.
1|"I took him into the forest. Then I see he's no good and think I'll go
1|and fetch a likelier one."
1|
1|"You see?... What a wogue--it's just as I thought," said Denisov
1|to the esaul. "Why didn't you bwing that one?"
1|
1|"What was the good of bringing him?" Tikhon interrupted hastily
1|and angrily--"that one wouldn't have done for you. As if I don't
1|know what sort you want!"
1|
1|"What a bwute you are!... Well?"
1|
1|"I went for another one," Tikhon continued, "and I crept like this
1|through the wood and lay down." (He suddenly lay down on his stomach
1|with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) "One turned up and
1|I grabbed him, like this." (He jumped up quickly and lightly.)
1|"'Come along to the colonel,' I said. He starts yelling, and
1|suddenly there were four of them. They rushed at me with their
1|little swords. So I went for them with my ax, this way: 'What are
1|you up to?' says I. 'Christ be with you!'" shouted Tikhon, waving
1|his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest.
1|
1|"Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
1|puddles!" said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.
1|
1|Petya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained
1|from laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to the
1|esaul's and Denisov's, unable to make out what it all meant.
1|
1|"Don't play the fool!" said Denisov, coughing angrily. "Why didn't
1|you bwing the first one?"
1|
1|Tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,
1|then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,
1|disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called
1|Shcherbaty--the gap-toothed). Denisov smiled, and Petya burst into a
1|peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined.
1|
1|"Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing," said Tikhon. "The
1|clothes on him--poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your
1|honor! Why, he says: 'I'm a general's son myself, I won't go!' he
1|says."
1|
1|"You are a bwute!" said Denisov. "I wanted to question..."
1|
1|"But I questioned him," said Tikhon. "He said he didn't know much.
1|'There are a lot of us,' he says, 'but all poor stuff--only soldiers
1|in name,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' he says, 'and you'll take
1|them all,'" Tikhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into
1|Denisov's eyes.
1|
1|"I'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes--that'll teach you to play the
1|fool!" said Denisov severely.
1|
1|"But why are you angry?" remonstrated Tikhon, "just as if I'd
1|never seen your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I'll
1|fetch you any of them you want--three if you like."
1|
1|"Well, let's go," said Denisov, and rode all the way to the
1|watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily.
1|
1|Tikhon followed behind and Petya heard the Cossacks laughing with
1|him and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the
1|bushes.
1|
1|When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tikhon's words and
1|smile had passed and Petya realized for a moment that this Tikhon
1|had killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive
1|drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted
1|only a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his head higher, to
1|brace himself, and to question the esaul with an air of importance
1|about tomorrow's undertaking, that he might not be unworthy of the
1|company in which he found himself.
1|
1|The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the way with
1|the news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.
1|
1|Denisov at once cheered up and, calling Petya to him, said: "Well,
1|tell me about yourself."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|Petya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow,
1|joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general
1|commanding a large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his
1|commission, and especially since he had joined the active army and
1|taken part in the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in a constant state
1|of blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic
1|hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was
1|highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army, but
1|at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic
1|exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be.
1|And he was always in a hurry to get where he was not.
1|
1|When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish
1|to send somebody to Denisov's detachment, Petya begged so piteously to
1|be sent that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he
1|recalled Petya's mad action at the battle of Vyazma, where instead
1|of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had
1|galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had
1|there twice fired his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade
1|his taking part in any action whatever of Denisov's. That was why
1|Petya had blushed and grown confused when Denisov asked him whether he
1|could stay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest
1|Petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and
1|return at once. But when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and
1|learned that there would certainly be an attack that night, he
1|decided, with the rapidity with which young people change their views,
1|that the general, whom he had greatly respected till then, was a
1|rubbishy German, that Denisov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and Tikhon
1|a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a
1|moment of difficulty.
1|
1|It was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and the esaul
1|rode up to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be
1|seen, and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the
1|glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest
1|where the French could not see the smoke. In the passage of the
1|small watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some
1|mutton. In the room three officers of Denisov's band were converting a
1|door into a tabletop. Petya took off his wet clothes, gave them to
1|be dried, and at once began helping the officers to fix up the
1|dinner table.
1|
1|In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the
1|table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.
1|
1|Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton
1|with his hands, down which the grease trickled, Petya was in an
1|ecstatic childish state of love for all men, and consequently of
1|confidence that others loved him in the same way.
1|
1|"So then what do you think, Vasili Dmitrich?" said he to Denisov.
1|"It's all right my staying a day with you?" And not waiting for a
1|reply he answered his own question: "You see I was told to find
1|out--well, I am finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into
1|the chief... I don't want a reward... But I want..."
1|
1|Petya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head
1|and flourishing his arms.
1|
1|"Into the vewy chief..." Denisov repeated with a smile.
1|
1|"Only, please let me command something, so that I may really
1|command..." Petya went on. "What would it be to you?... Oh, you want a
1|knife?" he said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a
1|piece of mutton.
1|
1|And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.
1|
1|"Please keep it. I have several like it," said Petya, blushing.
1|"Heavens! I was quite forgetting!" he suddenly cried. "I have some
1|raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler
1|and he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to
1|something sweet. Would you like some?..." and Petya ran out into the
1|passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained
1|about five pounds of raisins. "Have some, gentlemen, have some!"
1|
1|"You want a coffeepot, don't you?" he asked the esaul. "I bought a
1|capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he's very
1|honest, that's the chief thing. I'll be sure to send it to you. Or
1|perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out--that happens
1|sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are"--and
1|he showed a bag--"a hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please
1|take as many as you want, or all if you like...."
1|
1|Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Petya stopped and
1|blushed.
1|
1|He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that
1|was foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered
1|the French drummer boy. "It's capital for us here, but what of him?
1|Where have they put him? Have they fed him? Haven't they hurt his
1|feelings?" he thought. But having caught himself saying too much about
1|the flints, he was now afraid to speak out.
1|
1|"I might ask," he thought, "but they'll say: 'He's a boy himself and
1|so he pities the boy.' I'll show them tomorrow whether I'm a boy. Will
1|it seem odd if I ask?" Petya thought. "Well, never mind!" and
1|immediately, blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see
1|if they appeared ironical, he said:
1|
1|"May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him
1|something to eat?... Perhaps..."
1|
1|"Yes, he's a poor little fellow," said Denisov, who evidently saw
1|nothing shameful in this reminder. "Call him in. His name is Vincent
1|Bosse. Have him fetched."
1|
1|"I'll call him," said Petya.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow," Denisov repeated.
1|
1|Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this. He slipped in
1|between the officers, came close to Denisov, and said:
1|
1|"Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!"
1|
1|And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut.
1|
1|"Bosse! Vincent!" Petya cried, stopping outside the door.
1|
1|"Who do you want, sir?" asked a voice in the darkness.
1|
1|Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured
1|that day.
1|
1|"Ah, Vesenny?" said a Cossack.
1|
1|Vincent, the boy's name, had already been changed by the Cossacks
1|into Vesenny (vernal) and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers.
1|In both these adaptations the reference to spring (vesna) matched
1|the impression made by the young lad.
1|
1|"He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesenya!
1|Vesenya!--Vesenny!" laughing voices were heard calling to one
1|another in the darkness.
1|
1|"He's a smart lad," said an hussar standing near Petya. "We gave him
1|something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!"
1|
1|The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
1|darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.
1|
1|"Ah, c'est vous!" said Petya. "Voulez-vous manger? N'ayez pas
1|peur, on ne vous fera pas de mal,"* he added shyly and affectionately,
1|touching the boy's hand. "Entrez, entrez."*[2]
1|
1|
1|*"Ah, it's you! Do you want something to eat? Don't be afraid,
1|they won't hurt you."
1|
1|*[2] "Come in, come in."
1|
1|
1|"Merci, monsieur,"* said the drummer boy in a trembling almost
1|childish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.
1|
1|
1|*"Thank you, sir."
1|
1|
1|There were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but
1|did not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then
1|in the darkness he took the boy's hand and pressed it.
1|
1|"Come in, come in!" he repeated in a gentle whisper. "Oh, what can I
1|do for him?" he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in
1|first.
1|
1|When the boy had entered the hut, Petya sat down at a distance
1|from him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to
1|him. But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it
1|would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya's attention from the
1|drummer boy, to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given,
1|and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept
1|with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners. Petya
1|had heard in the army many stories of Dolokhov's extraordinary bravery
1|and of his cruelty to the French, so from the moment he entered the
1|hut Petya did not take his eyes from him, but braced himself up more
1|and more and held his head high, that he might not be unworthy even of
1|such company.
1|
1|Dolokhov's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity.
1|
1|Denisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas
1|the Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and
1|everything he did indicated his unusual position. But Dolokhov, who in
1|Moscow had worn a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most
1|correct officer of the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a
1|Guardsman's padded coat with an Order of St. George at his
1|buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head. He took
1|off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and without greeting
1|anyone went up to Denisov and began questioning him about the matter
1|in hand. Denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had
1|on the transport, of the message Petya had brought, and his own
1|replies to both generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French
1|detachment.
1|
1|"That's so. But we must know what troops they are and their
1|numbers," said Dolokhov. "It will be necessary to go there. We can't
1|start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I
1|like to work accurately. Here now--wouldn't one of these gentlemen
1|like to ride over to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare
1|uniform."
1|
1|"I, I... I'll go with you!" cried Petya.
1|
1|"There's no need for you to go at all," said Denisov, addressing
1|Dolokhov, "and as for him, I won't let him go on any account."
1|
1|"I like that!" exclaimed Petya. "Why shouldn't I go?"
1|
1|"Because it's useless."
1|
1|"Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and
1|that's all. You'll take me, won't you?" he said, turning to Dolokhov.
1|
1|"Why not?" Dolokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of
1|the French drummer boy. "Have you had that youngster with you long?"
1|he asked Denisov.
1|
1|"He was taken today but he knows nothing. I'm keeping him with me."
1|
1|"Yes, and where do you put the others?" inquired Dolokhov.
1|
1|"Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them," shouted
1|Denisov, suddenly flushing. "And I say boldly that I have not a single
1|man's life on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send
1|thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of
1|staining--I speak bluntly--staining the honor of a soldier?"
1|
1|"That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count
1|of sixteen," said Dolokhov with cold irony, "but it's time for you
1|to drop it."
1|
1|"Why, I've not said anything! I only say that I'll certainly go with
1|you," said Petya shyly.
1|
1|"But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to drop these amenities,"
1|continued Dolokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking
1|of this subject which irritated Denisov. "Now, why have you kept
1|this lad?" he went on, swaying his head. "Because you are sorry for
1|him! Don't we know those 'receipts' of yours? You send a hundred men
1|away, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So
1|isn't it all the same not to send them?"
1|
1|The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.
1|
1|"That's not the point. I'm not going to discuss the matter. I do not
1|wish to take it on my conscience. You say they'll die. All wight. Only
1|not by my fault!"
1|
1|Dolokhov began laughing.
1|
1|"Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if
1|they did catch me they'd string me up to an aspen tree, and with all
1|your chivalry just the same." He paused. "However, we must get to
1|work. Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms
1|in it. Well, are you coming with me?" he asked Petya.
1|
1|"I? Yes, yes, certainly!" cried Petya, blushing almost to tears
1|and glancing at Denisov.
1|
1|While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done
1|with prisoners, Petya had once more felt awkward and restless; but
1|again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about.
1|"If grown-up, distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and
1|right," thought he. "But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine
1|that I'll obey him and that he can order me about. I will certainly go
1|to the French camp with Dolokhov. If he can, so can I!"
1|
1|And to all Denisov's persuasions, Petya replied that he too was
1|accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that
1|he never considered personal danger.
1|
1|"For you'll admit that if we don't know for sure how many of them
1|there are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are
1|only two of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go,
1|so don't hinder me," said he. "It will only make things worse..."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, Petya and Dolokhov
1|rode to the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French
1|camp, and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended
1|into the hollow. On reaching the bottom, Dolokhov told the Cossacks
1|accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot
1|along the road to the bridge. Petya, his heart in his mouth with
1|excitement, rode by his side.
1|
1|"If we're caught, I won't be taken alive! I have a pistol,"
1|whispered he.
1|
1|"Don't talk Russian," said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper, and at
1|that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: "Qui
1|vive?"* and the click of a musket.
1|
1|
1|*"Who goes there?"
1|
1|
1|The blood rushed to Petya's face and he grasped his pistol.
1|
1|"Lanciers du 6-me,"* replied Dolokhov, neither hastening nor
1|slackening his horse's pace.
1|
1|
1|*"Lancers of the 6th Regiment."
1|
1|
1|The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.
1|
1|"Mot d'ordre."*
1|
1|
1|*"Password."
1|
1|
1|Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.
1|
1|"Dites donc, le colonel Gerard est ici?"* he asked.
1|
1|
1|*"Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?"
1|
1|
1|"Mot d'ordre," repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not
1|replying.
1|
1|"Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas
1|le mot d'ordre..." cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding
1|straight at the sentinel. "Je vous demande si le colonel est ici."*
1|
1|
1|*"When an officer is making his round, sentinels don't ask him for
1|the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is here."
1|
1|
1|And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped
1|aside, Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk.
1|
1|Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dolokhov
1|stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The
1|man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up
1|to Dolokhov's horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply
1|and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were
1|higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he
1|called the landowner's house.
1|
1|Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk
1|could be heard around the campfires, Dolokhov turned into the
1|courtyard of the landowner's house. Having ridden in, he dismounted
1|and approached a big blazing campfire, around which sat several men
1|talking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge
1|of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by
1|the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.
1|
1|"Oh, he's a hard nut to crack," said one of the officers who was
1|sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire.
1|
1|"He'll make them get a move on, those fellows!" said another,
1|laughing.
1|
1|Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of
1|Dolokhov's and Petya's steps as they advanced to the fire leading
1|their horses.
1|
1|"Bonjour, messieurs!"* said Dolokhov loudly and clearly.
1|
1|
1|*"Good day, gentlemen."
1|
1|
1|There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,
1|and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up
1|to Dolokhov.
1|
1|"Is that you, Clement?" he asked. "Where the devil...?" But, noticing
1|his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dolokhov as
1|a stranger, asking what he could do for him.
1|
1|Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake
1|their regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether
1|they knew anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything,
1|and Petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and
1|Dolokhov with hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were
1|silent.
1|
1|"If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too
1|late," said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.
1|
1|Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on
1|farther that night.
1|
1|He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot
1|and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the
1|long neck. That officer did not take his eyes from Dolokhov and
1|again asked to what regiment he belonged. Dolokhov, as if he had not
1|heard the question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe
1|which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far
1|the road before them was safe from Cossacks.
1|
1|"Those brigands are everywhere," replied an officer from behind
1|the fire.
1|
1|Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
1|such as his companion and himself, "but probably they would not dare
1|to attack large detachments?" he added inquiringly. No one replied.
1|
1|"Well, now he'll come away," Petya thought every moment as he
1|stood by the campfire listening to the talk.
1|
1|But Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and
1|began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the
1|battalion, how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about
1|the Russian prisoners with that detachment, Dolokhov said:
1|
1|"A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would
1|be better to shoot such rabble," and burst into loud laughter, so
1|strange that Petya thought the French would immediately detect their
1|disguise, and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.
1|
1|No one replied a word to Dolokhov's laughter, and a French officer
1|whom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and
1|whispered something to a companion. Dolokhov got up and called to
1|the soldier who was holding their horses.
1|
1|"Will they bring our horses or not?" thought Petya, instinctively
1|drawing nearer to Dolokhov.
1|
1|The horses were brought.
1|
1|"Good evening, gentlemen," said Dolokhov.
1|
1|Petya wished to say "Good night" but could not utter a word. The
1|officers were whispering together. Dolokhov was a long time mounting
1|his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at
1|a footpace. Petya rode beside him, longing to look round to see
1|whether or not the French were running after them, but not daring to.
1|
1|Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the
1|open country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and
1|listened. "Do you hear?" he asked. Petya recognized the sound of
1|Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round
1|their campfires. When they had descended to the bridge Petya and
1|Dolokhov rode past the sentinel, who without saying a word paced
1|morosely up and down it, then they descended into the hollow where the
1|Cossacks awaited them.
1|
1|"Well now, good-by. Tell Denisov, 'at the first shot at
1|daybreak,'" said Dolokhov and was about to ride away, but Petya seized
1|hold of him.
1|
1|"Really!" he cried, "you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how
1|splendid! How I love you!"
1|
1|"All right, all right!" said Dolokhov. But Petya did not let go of
1|him and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward
1|him and wanted to kiss him. Dolokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his
1|horse, and vanished into the darkness.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Having returned to the watchman's hut, Petya found Denisov in the
1|passage. He was awaiting Petya's return in a state of agitation,
1|anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.
1|
1|"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Yes, thank God!" he repeated,
1|listening to Petya's rapturous account. "But, devil take you, I
1|haven't slept because of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can
1|still get a nap before morning."
1|
1|"But... no," said Petya, "I don't want to sleep yet. Besides I
1|know myself, if I fall asleep it's finished. And then I am used to not
1|sleeping before a battle."
1|
1|He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
1|expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next
1|day.
1|
1|Then, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he rose and went out of
1|doors.
1|
1|It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were
1|still falling from the trees. Near the watchman's hut the black shapes
1|of the Cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered together could be
1|seen. Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their
1|horses beside them were discernible, and in the hollow the dying
1|campfire gleamed red. Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep;
1|here and there, amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of
1|the horses near by, could be heard low voices which seemed to be
1|whispering.
1|
1|Petya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.
1|Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses
1|munching their oats. In the dark Petya recognized his own horse, which
1|he called "Karabakh" though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to
1|it.
1|
1|"Well, Karabakh! We'll do some service tomorrow," said he,
1|sniffing its nostrils and kissing it.
1|
1|"Why aren't you asleep, sir?" said a Cossack who was sitting under a
1|wagon.
1|
1|"No, ah... Likhachev--isn't that your name? Do you know I have
1|only just come back! We've been into the French camp."
1|
1|And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride
1|but also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his
1|life than to act "just anyhow."
1|
1|"Well, you should get some sleep now," said the Cossack.
1|
1|"No, I am used to this," said Petya. "I say, aren't the flints in
1|your pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don't you want any? You
1|can have some."
1|
1|The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look
1|at Petya.
1|
1|"Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately," said
1|Petya. "Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and
1|then they're sorry for it afterwards. I don't like that."
1|
1|"Just so," said the Cossack.
1|
1|"Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen
1|my saber for me? It's got bl..." (Petya feared to tell a lie, and
1|the saber never had been sharpened.) "Can you do it?"
1|
1|"Of course I can."
1|
1|Likhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Petya heard the
1|warlike sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat
1|on its edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.
1|
1|"I say! Are the lads asleep?" asked Petya.
1|
1|"Some are, and some aren't--like us."
1|
1|"Well, and that boy?"
1|
1|"Vesenny? Oh, he's thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast
1|asleep after his fright. He was that glad!"
1|
1|After that Petya remained silent for a long time, listening to the
1|sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure
1|appeared.
1|
1|"What are you sharpening?" asked a man coming up to the wagon.
1|
1|"Why, this gentleman's saber."
1|
1|"That's right," said the man, whom Petya took to be an hussar.
1|"Was the cup left here?"
1|
1|"There, by the wheel!"
1|
1|The hussar took the cup.
1|
1|"It must be daylight soon," said he, yawning, and went away.
1|
1|Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov's
1|guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon
1|captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under
1|it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark
1|blotch to the right was the watchman's hut, and the red blotch below
1|to the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had
1|come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew
1|nor waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom
1|where nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be
1|the watchman's hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very
1|depths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be
1|the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a
1|wagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon
1|but on a terribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have
1|to fall for a whole day or a whole month, or go on falling and never
1|reach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhachev, who
1|was sitting under the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest,
1|most wonderful, most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of.
1|It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back
1|into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished--disappeared
1|altogether and dissolved into nothingness.
1|
1|Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was
1|in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.
1|
1|He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the
1|earth. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were
1|swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if
1|the clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes
1|it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed
1|to be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low
1|that one could touch it with one's hand.
1|
1|Petya's eyes began to close and he swayed a little.
1|
1|The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed
1|and jostled one another. Someone snored.
1|
1|"Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg..." hissed the saber against the whetstone,
1|and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,
1|sweetly solemn hymn. Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than
1|Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the
1|melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
1|fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The
1|melody grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was
1|played was a fugue--though Petya had not the least conception of what
1|a fugue is. Each instrument--now resembling a violin and now a horn,
1|but better and clearer than violin or horn--played its own part, and
1|before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that
1|began almost the same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and
1|they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended,
1|now into solemn church music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant
1|and triumphant.
1|
1|"Oh--why, that was in a dream!" Petya said to himself, as he lurched
1|forward. "It's in my ears. But perhaps it's music of my own. Well,
1|go on, my music! Now!..."
1|
1|He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance,
1|sounds fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again
1|all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. "Oh, this is
1|delightful! As much as I like and as I like!" said Petya to himself.
1|He tried to conduct that enormous orchestra.
1|
1|"Now softly, softly die away!" and the sounds obeyed him. "Now
1|fuller, more joyful. Still more and more joyful!" And from an
1|unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds. "Now voices join
1|in!" ordered Petya. And at first from afar he heard men's voices and
1|then women's. The voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and
1|Petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy.
1|
1|With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from
1|the trees, and the hissing of the saber, "Ozheg-zheg-zheg..." and
1|again the horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the
1|choir but joining in it.
1|
1|Petya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all
1|the time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no
1|one to share it. He was awakened by Likhachev's kindly voice.
1|
1|"It's ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!"
1|
1|Petya woke up.
1|
1|"It's getting light, it's really getting light!" he exclaimed.
1|
1|The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to
1|their very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare
1|branches. Petya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket
1|and gave it to Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and
1|sheathed it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening
1|their saddle girths.
1|
1|"And here's the commander," said Likhachev.
1|
1|Denisov came out of the watchman's hut and, having called Petya,
1|gave orders to get ready.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness,
1|tightened their saddle girths, and formed companies. Denisov stood
1|by the watchman's hut giving final orders. The infantry of the
1|detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the
1|trees in the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through
1|the mud. The esaul gave some orders to his men. Petya held his horse
1|by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face,
1|having been bathed in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were
1|particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down his spine and his
1|whole body pulsed rhythmically.
1|
1|"Well, is ev'wything weady?" asked Denisov. "Bwing the horses."
1|
1|The horses were brought. Denisov was angry with the Cossack
1|because the saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted.
1|Petya put his foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to
1|nip his leg, but Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of
1|his own weight and, turning to look at the hussars starting in the
1|darkness behind him, rode up to Denisov.
1|
1|"Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for
1|God's sake...!" said he.
1|
1|Denisov seemed to have forgotten Petya's very existence. He turned
1|to glance at him.
1|
1|"I ask one thing of you," he said sternly, "to obey me and not shove
1|yourself forward anywhere."
1|
1|He did not say another word to Petya but rode in silence all the
1|way. When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably
1|growing light over the field. Denisov talked in whispers with the
1|esaul and the Cossacks rode past Petya and Denisov. When they had
1|all ridden by, Denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill.
1|Slipping onto their haunches and sliding, the horses descended with
1|their riders into the ravine. Petya rode beside Denisov, the pulsation
1|of his body constantly increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter,
1|but the mist still hid distant objects. Having reached the valley,
1|Denisov looked back and nodded to a Cossack beside him.
1|
1|"The signal!" said he.
1|
1|The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the
1|tramp of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from
1|various sides, and then more shots.
1|
1|At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Petya lashed his
1|horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov who
1|shouted at him. It seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was
1|fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.
1|Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the
1|bridge he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he
1|galloped on. In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were
1|running from right to left across the road. One of them fell in the
1|mud under his horse's feet.
1|
1|Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the
1|midst of that crowd terrible screams arose. Petya galloped up, and the
1|first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,
1|clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.
1|
1|"Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!" shouted Petya, and giving rein to his
1|excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.
1|
1|He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged
1|Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,
1|were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking
1|Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red
1|face, had been defending himself against the hussars. When Petya
1|galloped up the Frenchman had already fallen. "Too late again!"
1|flashed through Petya's mind and he galloped on to the place from
1|which the rapid firing could be heard. The shots came from the yard of
1|the landowner's house he had visited the night before with Dolokhov.
1|The French were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden
1|thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who
1|crowded at the gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached the
1|gate, Petya saw Dolokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish tint,
1|shouting to his men. "Go round! Wait for the infantry!" he exclaimed
1|as Petya rode up to him.
1|
1|"Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!" shouted Petya, and without pausing a moment
1|galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
1|smoke was thickest.
1|
1|A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others
1|plashed against something. The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped after
1|Petya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke
1|some of the French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes
1|to meet the Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the
1|pond. Petya was galloping along the courtyard, but instead of
1|holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and
1|strangely, slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle. His
1|horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the
1|morning light, stopped suddenly, and Petya fell heavily on to the
1|wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly
1|though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his skull.
1|
1|After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the
1|house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that
1|they surrendered, Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, who lay
1|motionless with outstretched arms.
1|
1|"Done for!" he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet
1|Denisov who was riding toward him.
1|
1|"Killed?" cried Denisov, recognizing from a distance the
1|unmistakably lifeless attitude--very familiar to him--in which Petya's
1|body was lying.
1|
1|"Done for!" repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance of these words
1|afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who
1|were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. "We won't take
1|them!" he called out to Denisov.
1|
1|Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, dismounted, and with
1|trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained,
1|mud-bespattered face which had already gone white.
1|
1|"I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!"
1|he recalled Petya's words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise
1|at the sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denisov turned
1|away, walked to the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.
1|
1|Among the Russian prisoners rescued by Denisov and Dolokhov was
1|Pierre Bezukhov.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been
1|issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners
1|among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party
1|was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it
1|had left Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled
1|the first stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other
1|half had gone on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had
1|marched in front of the prisoners was left; they had all
1|disappeared. The artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them
1|during the first days was now replaced by Marshal Junot's enormous
1|baggage train, convoyed by Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a
1|cavalry baggage train.
1|
1|From Vyazma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in
1|three columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder
1|that Pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving
1|Moscow had now reached the utmost limit.
1|
1|The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
1|horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
1|continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again
1|lagging behind it.
1|
1|Several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
1|soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run
1|headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and
1|abused each other for their causeless panic.
1|
1|These three groups traveling together--the cavalry stores, the
1|convoy of prisoners, and Junot's baggage train--still constituted a
1|separate and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly
1|melting away.
1|
1|Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred
1|and twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been
1|captured or left behind. Some of Junot's wagons also had been captured
1|or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers
1|from Davout's corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned
1|that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to
1|the prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had
1|been shot by the marshal's own order because a silver spoon
1|belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession.
1|
1|The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three
1|hundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a
1|hundred now remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort
1|than even the cavalry saddles or Junot's baggage. They understood that
1|the saddles and Junot's spoon might be of some use, but that cold
1|and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and
1|hungry Russians who froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case
1|the order was to shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but
1|revolting. And the escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition
1|they themselves were in, of giving way to the pity they felt for the
1|prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse, treated
1|them with particular moroseness and severity.
1|
1|At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the
1|prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores,
1|several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away,
1|but were recaptured by the French and shot.
1|
1|The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer
1|prisoners should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been
1|abandoned. All who could walk went together, and after the third stage
1|Pierre had rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that
1|had chosen Karataev for its master.
1|
1|On the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell ill with
1|the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he
1|grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know
1|why, but since Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an
1|effort to go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning
1|with which Karataev generally lay down at the halting places, and when
1|he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than
1|before, Pierre moved farther away and did not think about him.
1|
1|While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his
1|intellect but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is
1|created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the
1|satisfaction of simple human needs, and that all unhappiness arises
1|not from privation but from superfluity. And now during these last
1|three weeks of the march he had learned still another new, consolatory
1|truth--that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned that
1|as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely
1|free, so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack
1|freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and
1|that those limits are very near together; that the person in a bed
1|of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now,
1|sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while
1|the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes
1|he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
1|that were covered with sores--his footgear having long since fallen to
1|pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife--of his own
1|free will as it had seemed to him--he had been no more free than now
1|when they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself
1|subsequently termed his sufferings, but which at the time he
1|scarcely felt, the worst was the state of his bare, raw, and
1|scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing,
1|the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was
1|even pleasant; there was no great cold, it was always warm walking
1|in the daytime, and at night there were the campfires; the lice that
1|devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing that was at first hard to
1|bear was his feet.
1|
1|After the second day's march Pierre, having examined his feet by the
1|campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when
1|everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,
1|walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more
1|terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,
1|but thought of other things.
1|
1|Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
1|saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to
1|another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows
1|superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain
1|limit.
1|
1|He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who
1|lagged behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did
1|not think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would
1|soon have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about
1|himself. The harder his position became and the more terrible the
1|future, the more independent of that position in which he found
1|himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts, memories, and
1|imaginings that came to him.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill
1|along the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the
1|roughness of the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd
1|around him and then again at his feet. The former and the latter
1|were alike familiar and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran
1|merrily along the side of the road, sometimes in proof of its
1|agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along
1|on three, and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at
1|the crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleeker
1|than it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh of different
1|animals--from men to horses--in various stages of decomposition; and
1|as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all
1|it wanted.
1|
1|It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment
1|it might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began
1|raining harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed
1|the water, which ran along the ruts in streams.
1|
1|Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps
1|in threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally
1|addressing the rain, he repeated: "Now then, now then, go on! Pelt
1|harder!"
1|
1|It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and
1|deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and
1|comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction
1|from a conversation with Karataev the day before.
1|
1|At their yesterday's halting place, feeling chilly by a dying
1|campfire, Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was
1|burning better. There Platon Karataev was sitting covered up--head and
1|all--with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers
1|in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre
1|knew. It was already past midnight, the hour when Karataev was usually
1|free of his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the
1|fire and heard Platon's voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his
1|pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at
1|his heart. His feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he
1|wished to go away, but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down,
1|trying not to look at Platon.
1|
1|"Well, how are you?" he asked.
1|
1|"How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won't grant us death,"
1|replied Platon, and at once resumed the story he had begun.
1|
1|"And so, brother," he continued, with a smile on his pale
1|emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes, "you
1|see, brother..."
1|
1|Pierre had long been familiar with that story. Karataev had told
1|it to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially
1|joyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that
1|tale as to something new, and the quiet rapture Karataev evidently
1|felt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was
1|of an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with his
1|family, and who went once to the Nizhni fair with a companion--a
1|rich merchant.
1|
1|Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning
1|his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained
1|knife was found under the old merchant's pillow. He was tried,
1|knouted, and his nostrils having been torn off, "all in due form" as
1|Karataev put it, he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.
1|
1|"And so, brother" (it was at this point that Pierre came up), "ten
1|years or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict,
1|submitting as he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God
1|for death. Well, one night the convicts were gathered just as we
1|are, with the old man among them. And they began telling what each was
1|suffering for, and how they had sinned against God. One told how he
1|had taken a life, another had taken two, a third had set a house on
1|fire, while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. So
1|they asked the old man: 'What are you being punished for, Daddy?'--'I,
1|my dear brothers,' said he, 'am being punished for my own and other
1|men's sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was
1|not mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant,
1|my dear brothers, and had much property. 'And he went on to tell
1|them all about it in due order. 'I don't grieve for myself,' he
1|says, 'God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my old
1|wife and the children,' and the old man began to weep. Now it happened
1|that in the group was the very man who had killed the other
1|merchant. 'Where did it happen, Daddy?' he said. 'When, and in what
1|month?' He asked all about it and his heart began to ache. So he comes
1|up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet! 'You are
1|perishing because of me, Daddy,' he says. 'It's quite true, lads, that
1|this man,' he says, 'is being tortured innocently and for nothing! I,'
1|he says, 'did that deed, and I put the knife under your head while you
1|were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,' he says, 'for Christ's sake!'"
1|
1|Karataev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and
1|he drew the logs together.
1|
1|"And the old man said, 'God will forgive you, we are all sinners
1|in His sight. I suffer for my own sins,' and he wept bitter tears.
1|Well, and what do you think, dear friends?" Karataev continued, his
1|face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he
1|now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his
1|story: "What do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to
1|the authorities. 'I have taken six lives,' he says (he was a great
1|sinner), 'but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don't let
1|him suffer because of me.' So he confessed and it was all written down
1|and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and
1|while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in
1|the papers all in due form--the authorities I mean--time passed. The
1|affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar's decree came: to
1|set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been
1|awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man.
1|'Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A
1|paper has come from the Tsar!' so they began looking for him," here
1|Karataev's lower jaw trembled, "but God had already forgiven him--he
1|was dead! That's how it was, dear fellows!" Karataev concluded and sat
1|for a long time silent, gazing before him with a smile.
1|
1|And Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story
1|itself but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that
1|lit up Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic significance of
1|that joy.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|"A vos places!"* suddenly cried a voice.
1|
1|
1|*"To your places."
1|
1|
1|A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something
1|joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
1|prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left
1|came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the
1|prisoners at a trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension
1|people feel at the approach of those in authority. The prisoners
1|thronged together and were pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.
1|
1|"The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!" and hardly had
1|the sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses
1|rattled by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat
1|with a tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of
1|the marshals. His eye fell on Pierre's large and striking figure,
1|and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre
1|thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.
1|
1|The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with
1|a red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several
1|officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their
1|faces all looked excited and worried.
1|
1|"What did he say? What did he say?" Pierre heard them ask.
1|
1|While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in
1|a crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that
1|morning. He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On
1|his face, besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday
1|while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently,
1|there was now an expression of quiet solemnity.
1|
1|Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
1|tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say
1|something to him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself.
1|He made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away.
1|
1|When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round.
1|Karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch
1|tree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look
1|round again but went limping up the hill.
1|
1|From behind, where Karataev had been sitting, came the sound of a
1|shot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that
1|he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
1|Smolensk--a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And
1|he again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one
1|of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale,
1|and in the expression on their faces--one of them glanced timidly at
1|Pierre--there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of
1|the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and
1|remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt
1|while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.
1|
1|Behind him, where Karataev had been sitting, the dog began to
1|howl. "What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?" thought Pierre.
1|
1|His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided
1|looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog
1|was howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their
1|faces.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal's baggage train stopped
1|at the village of Shamshevo. The men crowded together round the
1|campfires. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh,
1|lay down with his back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He
1|again slept as he had done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino.
1|
1|Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or
1|another, gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same
1|thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk.
1|
1|"Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and
1|that movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in
1|consciousness of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and
1|more blessed than all else is to love this life in one's sufferings,
1|in innocent sufferings."
1|
1|"Karataev!" came to Pierre's mind.
1|
1|And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly
1|old man who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. "Wait a
1|bit," said the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was
1|alive--a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface
1|consisted of drops closely pressed together, and all these drops moved
1|and changed places, sometimes several of them merging into one,
1|sometimes one dividing into many. Each drop tried to spread out and
1|occupy as much space as possible, but others striving to do the same
1|compressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.
1|
1|"That is life," said the old teacher.
1|
1|"How simple and clear it is," thought Pierre. "How is it I did not
1|know it before?"
1|
1|"God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect
1|Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from
1|the surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now,
1|Karataev has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?"
1|said the teacher.
1|
1|"Do you understand, damn you?" shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.
1|
1|He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a
1|Russian soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting
1|a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and
1|his sinewy, hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned
1|the ramrod. His brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly
1|visible by the glow of the charcoal.
1|
1|"It's all the same to him," he muttered, turning quickly to a
1|soldier who stood behind him. "Brigand! Get away!"
1|
1|And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned
1|away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier
1|the Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting
1|something with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the
1|blue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.
1|
1|"Ah, he's come?" said Pierre. "And Plat-" he began, but did not
1|finish.
1|
1|Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his
1|fancy--of the look Platon had given him as he sat under the tree, of
1|the shot heard from that spot, of the dog's howl, of the guilty
1|faces of the two Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and
1|smoking gun, and of Karataev's absence at this halt--and he was on the
1|point of realizing that Karataev had been killed, but just at that
1|instant, he knew not why, the recollection came to his mind of a
1|summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady on the
1|veranda of his house in Kiev. And without linking up the events of the
1|day or drawing a conclusion from them, Pierre closed his eyes,
1|seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories
1|of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating globe, and he sank into
1|water so that it closed over his head.
1|
1|Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid
1|firing. French soldiers were running past him.
1|
1|"The Cossacks!" one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of
1|Russians surrounded Pierre.
1|
1|For a long time he could not understand what was happening to him.
1|All around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.
1|
1|"Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!" old soldiers exclaimed, weeping,
1|as they embraced Cossacks and hussars.
1|
1|The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered
1|them clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he
1|sat among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier
1|who approached him, and kissed him, weeping.
1|
1|Dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd of
1|disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had
1|happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed
1|Dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched
1|them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent.
1|On the opposite side stood Dolokhov's Cossack, counting the
1|prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.
1|
1|"How many?" Dolokhov asked the Cossack.
1|
1|"The second hundred," replied the Cossack.
1|
1|"Filez, filez!"* Dolokhov kept saying, having adopted this
1|expression from the French, and when his eyes met those of the
1|prisoners they flashed with a cruel light.
1|
1|
1|*"Get along, get along!"
1|
1|
1|Denisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some
1|Cossacks who were carrying the body of Petya Rostov to a hole that had
1|been dug in the garden.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight
1|of the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men
1|freezing, or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while
1|carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past,
1|carrying away the property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings,
1|and dukes; but the process of the flight and disintegration of the
1|French army went on essentially as before.
1|
1|From Moscow to Vyazma the French army of seventy-three thousand
1|men not reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but
1|pillage) was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five
1|thousand had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding
1|terms of the progression could be determined mathematically. The
1|French army melted away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to
1|Vyazma, from Vyazma to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and
1|from the Berezina to Vilna--independently of the greater or lesser
1|intensity of the cold, the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any
1|other particular conditions. Beyond Vyazma the French army instead
1|of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass, and so went
1|on to the end. Berthier wrote to his Emperor (we know how far
1|commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in
1|describing the condition of an army) and this is what he said:
1|
1|
1|I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the
1|various corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages
1|of the last two or three days' march. They are almost disbanded.
1|Scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their
1|regiments, the others go off by themselves in different directions
1|hoping to find food and escape discipline. In general they regard
1|Smolensk as the place where they hope to recover. During the last few
1|days many of the men have been seen to throw away their cartridges and
1|their arms. In such a state of affairs, whatever your ultimate plans
1|may be, the interest of Your Majesty's service demands that the army
1|should be rallied at Smolensk and should first of all be freed from
1|ineffectives, such as dismounted cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and
1|artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present
1|forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with hunger and fatigue, need
1|these supplies as well as a few days' rest. Many have died these last
1|days on the road or at the bivouacs. This state of things is
1|continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a prompt
1|remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case
1|of an engagement.
1|
1|November 9: twenty miles from Smolensk.
1|
1|
1|After staggering into Smolensk which seemed to them a promised land,
1|the French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own
1|stores, and when everything had been plundered fled farther.
1|
1|They all went without knowing whither or why they were going.
1|Still less did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any
1|orders to him. But still he and those about him retained their old
1|habits: wrote commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day;
1|called one another sire, mon cousin, prince d'Eckmuhl, roi de
1|Naples, and so on. But these orders and reports were only on paper,
1|nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out,
1|and though they entitled one another Majesties, Highnesses, or
1|Cousins, they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had
1|done much evil for which they had now to pay. And though they
1|pretended to be concerned about the army, each was thinking only of
1|himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign
1|from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian
1|blindman's bluff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of them
1|occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
1|whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into
1|a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to
1|escape runs straight into his opponent's arms.
1|
1|At first while they were still moving along the Kaluga road,
1|Napoleon's armies made their presence known, but later when they
1|reached the Smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell
1|tight--and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the
1|Russians.
1|
1|Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit
1|and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of
1|approximately ascertaining the enemy's position--by cavalry
1|scouting--was not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent
1|and rapid change of position by each army, even what information was
1|obtained could not be delivered in time. If news was received one
1|day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before, by
1|the third day when something could have been done, that army was
1|already two days' march farther on and in quite another position.
1|
1|One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smolensk there were
1|several different roads available for the French, and one would have
1|thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned
1|where the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan
1|and undertaken something new. But after a four days' halt the mob,
1|with no maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten
1|track, neither to the right nor to the left but along the old--the
1|worst--road, through Krasnoe and Orsha.
1|
1|Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French
1|separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of
1|twenty-four hours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, then the
1|kings, then the dukes. The Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take
1|the road to the right beyond the Dnieper--which was the only
1|reasonable thing for him to do--themselves turned to the right and
1|came out onto the highroad at Krasnoe. And here as in a game of
1|blindman's buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing their enemy
1|unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the
1|sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their
1|comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days separate
1|portions of the French army--first Murat's (the vice-king's), then
1|Davout's, and then Ney's--ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian
1|army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage,
1|their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the
1|Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.
1|
1|Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
1|Smolensk which were in nobody's way, because despite the unfortunate
1|plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor
1|against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of
1|ten thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsha with only one thousand men
1|left, having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having
1|crossed the Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.
1|
1|From Orsha they fled farther along the road to Vilna, still
1|playing at blindman's buff with the pursuing army. At the Berezina
1|they again became disorganized, many were drowned and many
1|surrendered, but those who got across the river fled farther. Their
1|supreme chief donned a fur coat and, having seated himself in a
1|sleigh, galloped on alone, abandoning his companions. The others who
1|could do so drove away too, leaving those who could not to surrender
1|or die.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which
1|they did all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they
1|turned onto the Kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the
1|army, none of the movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might
1|have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the
1|historians, who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of
1|one man, would have found it impossible to make the story of the
1|retreat fit their theory. But no! Mountains of books have been written
1|by the historians about this campaign, and everywhere are described
1|Napoleon's arrangements, the maneuvers, and his profound plans which
1|guided the army, as well as the military genius shown by his marshals.
1|
1|The retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he had a free road into a
1|well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along
1|which Kutuzov afterwards pursued him--this unnecessary retreat along a
1|devastated road--is explained to us as being due to profound
1|considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for his
1|retreat from Smolensk to Orsha. Then his heroism at Krasnoe is
1|described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle
1|and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick
1|and said:
1|
1|"J'ai assez fait l'empereur; il est temps de faire le general,"* but
1|nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the
1|scattered fragments of the army he left behind.
1|
1|
1|*"I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act the
1|general."
1|
1|
1|Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals,
1|especially of Ney--a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he
1|made his way by night around through the forest and across the Dnieper
1|and escaped to Orsha, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths
1|of his men.
1|
1|And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic
1|army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
1|characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in
1|ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is
1|taught to be ashamed of--even that act finds justification in the
1|historians' language.
1|
1|When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of
1|historical ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly
1|contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just, the historians
1|produce a saving conception of "greatness." "Greatness," it seems,
1|excludes the standards of right and wrong. For the "great" man nothing
1|is wrong, there is no atrocity for which a "great" man can be blamed.
1|
1|"C'est grand!"* say the historians, and there no longer exists
1|either good or evil but only "grand" and "not grand." Grand is good,
1|not grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of
1|some special animals called "heroes." And Napoleon, escaping home in a
1|warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his
1|comrades but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que
1|c'est grand,*[2] and his soul is tranquil.
1|
1|
1|*"It is great."
1|
1|*[2] That it is great.
1|
1|
1|"Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n'y
1|a qu'un pas,"* said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been
1|repeating: "Sublime! Grand! Napoleon le Grand!" Du sublime au ridicule
1|il n'y a qu'un pas.
1|
1|
1|*"From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step."
1|
1|
1|And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not
1|commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to
1|admit one's own nothingness and immeasurable meanness.
1|
1|For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no
1|human actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where
1|simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent.

1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign
1|of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,
1|dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is
1|that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three
1|armies surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered
1|French, hungry and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the
1|historians relate) the aim of the Russians was to stop the French,
1|to cut them off, and capture them all?
1|
1|How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than
1|the French had given battle at Borodino, did not achieve its purpose
1|when it had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim
1|was to capture them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us
1|that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not
1|beat them? How could that happen?
1|
1|History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions
1|says that this occurred because Kutuzov and Tormasov and Chichagov,
1|and this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers...
1|
1|But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were
1|guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried
1|and punished? But even if we admitted that Kutuzov, Chichagov, and
1|others were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still
1|incomprehensible why, the position of the Russian army being what it
1|was at Krasnoe and at the Berezina (in both cases we had superior
1|forces), the French army with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not
1|captured, if that was what the Russians aimed at.
1|
1|The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military
1|historians (to the effect that Kutuzov hindered an attack) is
1|unfounded, for we know that he could not restrain the troops from
1|attacking at Vyazma and Tarutino.
1|
1|Why was the Russian army--which with inferior forces had withstood
1|the enemy in full strength at Borodino--defeated at Krasnoe and the
1|Berezina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was
1|numerically superior?
1|
1|If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
1|Napoleon and his marshals--and that aim was not merely frustrated
1|but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled--then
1|this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the
1|French to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly considered
1|victorious by Russian historians.
1|
1|The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
1|of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical
1|rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit
1|that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for
1|Napoleon and defeats for Kutuzov.
1|
1|But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
1|conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French
1|victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series of
1|Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
1|liberation of their country.
1|
1|The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the
1|historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns
1|and the generals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth,
1|have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that
1|never existed, namely that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon
1|with his marshals and his army.
1|
1|There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have
1|been senseless and its attainment quite impossible.
1|
1|It would have been senseless, first because Napoleon's
1|disorganized army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that
1|is to say, was doing just what every Russian desired. So what was
1|the use of performing various operations on the French who were
1|running away as fast as they possibly could?
1|
1|Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men
1|whose whole energy was directed to flight.
1|
1|Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one's own
1|troops in order to destroy the French army, which without external
1|interference was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its
1|path was not blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than
1|it actually did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original
1|army.
1|
1|Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the
1|Emperor, kings, and dukes--whose capture would have been in the
1|highest degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit
1|diplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized.
1|Still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of
1|the French, when our own army had melted away to half before
1|reaching Krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy
1|the corps of prisoners, and when our men were not always getting
1|full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger.
1|
1|All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon
1|and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving
1|out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had
1|planted, should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The
1|only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he
1|was very angry. But not even that could be said for those who drew
1|up this project, for it was not they who had suffered from the
1|trampled beds.
1|
1|But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would
1|have been senseless, it was impossible.
1|
1|It was impossible first because--as experience shows that a
1|three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with
1|the plans--the probability of Chichagov, Kutuzov, and Wittgenstein
1|effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to
1|be tantamount to impossibility, as in fact thought Kutuzov, who when
1|he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great
1|distances do not yield the desired results.
1|
1|Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with
1|which Napoleon's army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than
1|the Russians possessed would have been required.
1|
1|Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term "to cut off"
1|has no meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army.
1|To cut off an army--to bar its road--is quite impossible, for there is
1|always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when
1|nothing can be seen, as the military scientists might convince
1|themselves by the example of Krasnoe and of the Berezina. It is only
1|possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it
1|is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one's hand. Men
1|can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules
1|of strategy and tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops
1|quite rightly did not consider that this suited them, since death by
1|hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike.
1|
1|Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the
1|world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those
1|that obtained in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the
1|French strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done
1|more without destroying itself.
1|
1|During the movement of the Russian army from Tarutino to Krasnoe
1|it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to
1|the population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of
1|the army without a battle.
1|
1|And it is of this period of the campaign--when the army lacked boots
1|and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and
1|was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees
1|of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and
1|the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
1|maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where
1|discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for
1|months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and
1|cold, when half the army perished in a single month--it is of this
1|period of the campaign that the historians tell us how Miloradovich
1|should have made a flank march to such and such a place, Tormasov to
1|another place, and Chichagov should have crossed (more than
1|knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so "routed" and
1|"cut off" the French and so on and so on.
1|
1|The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should
1|have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not
1|to blame because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed
1|that they should do what was impossible.
1|
1|All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between
1|the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the
1|historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the
1|beautiful words and sentiments of various generals, and not the
1|history of the events.
1|
1|To them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting, and so do
1|their surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but
1|the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals
1|and in graves does not even interest them, for it does not come within
1|the range of their investigation.
1|
1|Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans
1|and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who
1|took a direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed
1|insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.
1|
1|The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in
1|the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it
1|was senseless and unattainable.
1|
1|The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion.
1|That aim was attained in the first place of itself, as the French
1|ran away, and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight.
1|Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying
1|the French, and thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was
1|following the French, ready to use its strength in case their movement
1|stopped.
1|
1|The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the
1|experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
1|menace than to strike the running animal on the head.

1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror:
1|substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it
1|is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this
1|horror at the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual
1|wound, which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes
1|heals, but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.
1|
1|After Prince Andrew's death Natasha and Princess Mary alike felt
1|this. Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing
1|cloud of death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the
1|face. They carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and
1|painful contact. Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street,
1|a summons to dinner, the maid's inquiry what dress to prepare, or
1|worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an
1|insult, painfully irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary
1|quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful
1|choir that still resounded in their imagination, and hindered their
1|gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant
1|had opened out before them.
1|
1|Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and
1|pain. They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it
1|was of very unimportant matters.
1|
1|Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of
1|a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did
1|they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them
1|that what they had lived through and experienced could not be
1|expressed in words, and that any reference to the details of his
1|life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been
1|accomplished before their eyes.
1|
1|Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of
1|everything that might lead up to the subject--this halting on all
1|sides at the boundary of what they might not mention--brought before
1|their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were
1|both feeling.
1|
1|But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete
1|joy. Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent
1|arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was
1|the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which
1|she had dwelt for the first fortnight. She received letters from her
1|relations to which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas
1|had been put was damp and he began to cough; Alpatych came to
1|Yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice
1|and suggestions that they should return to Moscow to the house on
1|the Vozdvizhenka Street, which had remained uninjured and needed
1|only slight repairs. Life did not stand still and it was necessary
1|to live. Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm
1|of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then, and
1|sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Natasha alone, yet the
1|cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded
1|to them. She went through the accounts with Alpatych, conferred with
1|Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and made preparations
1|for the journey to Moscow.
1|
1|Natasha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making
1|preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.
1|
1|Princess Mary asked the countess to let Natasha go with her to
1|Moscow, and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw
1|their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change
1|of scene and the advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.
1|
1|"I am not going anywhere," Natasha replied when this was proposed to
1|her. "Do please just leave me alone!" And she ran out of the room,
1|with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation
1|rather than of sorrow.
1|
1|After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her
1|grief, Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself,
1|sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and
1|twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing
1|intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This
1|solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of
1|it. As soon as anyone entered she got up quickly, changed her position
1|and expression, and picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting
1|impatiently for the intruder to go.
1|
1|She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on
1|which--with a terrible questioning too great for her strength--her
1|spiritual gaze was fixed.
1|
1|One day toward the end of December Natasha, pale and thin, dressed
1|in a black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a
1|knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously
1|crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at
1|a corner of the door.
1|
1|She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone--to the other
1|side of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never
1|before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and
1|improbable, was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible
1|than this side of life, where everything was either emptiness and
1|desolation or suffering and indignity.
1|
1|She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine
1|him otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he
1|had been at Mytishchi, at Troitsa, and at Yaroslavl.
1|
1|She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own,
1|and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.
1|
1|There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning
1|his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his
1|shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and
1|a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs
1|twitches just perceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha knows that he is
1|struggling with terrible pain. "What is that pain like? Why does he
1|have that pain? What does he feel? How does it hurt him?" thought
1|Natasha. He noticed her watching him, raised his eyes, and began to
1|speak seriously:
1|
1|"One thing would be terrible," said he: "to bind oneself forever
1|to a suffering man. It would be continual torture." And he looked
1|searchingly at her. Natasha as usual answered before she had time to
1|think what she would say. She said: "This can't go on--it won't. You
1|will get well--quite well."
1|
1|She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what
1|she had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at
1|those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in
1|that protracted gaze.
1|
1|"I agreed," Natasha now said to herself, "that it would be
1|dreadful if he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because
1|it would have been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently.
1|He thought it would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live
1|and feared death. And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not
1|say what I meant. I thought quite differently. Had I said what I
1|thought, I should have said: even if he had to go on dying, to die
1|continually before my eyes, I should have been happy compared with
1|what I am now. Now there is nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No,
1|he did not and never will know it. And now it will never, never be
1|possible to put it right." And now he again seemed to be saying the
1|same words to her, only in her imagination Natasha this time gave
1|him a different answer. She stopped him and said: "Terrible for you,
1|but not for me! You know that for me there is nothing in life but you,
1|and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me," and he
1|took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible
1|evening four days before his death. And in her imagination she said
1|other tender and loving words which she might have said then but
1|only spoke now: "I love thee!... thee! I love, love..." she said,
1|convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate
1|effort...
1|
1|She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in
1|her eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.
1|Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again
1|with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And
1|now, now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at
1|the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing
1|itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her
1|ears. Dunyasha, her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a
1|frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.
1|
1|"Come to your Papa at once, please!" said she with a strange,
1|excited look. "A misfortune... about Peter Ilynich... a letter," she
1|finished with a sob.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natasha was feeling
1|a special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of
1|them--her father, mother, and Sonya--were so near to her, so familiar,
1|so commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult
1|to the world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not
1|merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard
1|Dunyasha's words about Peter Ilynich and a misfortune, but did not
1|grasp them.
1|
1|"What misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live
1|their own old, quiet, and commonplace life," thought Natasha.
1|
1|As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of
1|her mother's room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He had
1|evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
1|choking him. When he saw Natasha he waved his arms despairingly and
1|burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round
1|face.
1|
1|"Pe... Petya... Go, go, she... is calling..." and weeping like a
1|child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost
1|fell into it, covering his face with his hands.
1|
1|Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natasha's whole
1|being. Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache
1|as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But
1|the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the
1|oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life.
1|The sight of her father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that
1|she heard through the door, made her immediately forget herself and
1|her own grief.
1|
1|She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to
1|her mother's door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came
1|out from that room and taking Natasha by the arm said something to
1|her. Natasha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid
1|steps, pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with
1|herself, and then ran to her mother.
1|
1|The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward
1|position, stretching out and beating her head against the wall.
1|Sonya and the maids were holding her arms.
1|
1|"Natasha! Natasha!..." cried the countess. "It's not true... it's
1|not true... He's lying... Natasha!" she shrieked, pushing those around
1|her away. "Go away, all of you; it's not true! Killed!... ha, ha,
1|ha!... It's not true!"
1|
1|Natasha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother,
1|embraced her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face
1|toward herself, and clung to her.
1|
1|"Mummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy," she kept on
1|whispering, not pausing an instant.
1|
1|She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,
1|demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her
1|mother's dress.
1|
1|"My dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!..." she whispered
1|incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her
1|own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.
1|
1|The countess pressed her daughter's hand, closed her eyes, and
1|became quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed
1|swiftness, glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Natasha began to
1|press her daughter's head with all her strength. Then she turned
1|toward her daughter's face which was wincing with pain and gazed
1|long at it.
1|
1|"Natasha, you love me?" she said in a soft trustful whisper.
1|"Natasha, you would not deceive me? You'll tell me the whole truth?"
1|
1|Natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look
1|there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.
1|
1|"My darling Mummy!" she repeated, straining all the power of her
1|love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that
1|crushed her mother.
1|
1|And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing
1|to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in
1|the bloom of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.
1|
1|Natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the
1|next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother.
1|Her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the
1|countess every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling
1|her to life.
1|
1|During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few
1|minutes, and Natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and
1|closed her eyes, but opened them again on hearing the bedstead
1|creak. The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly.
1|
1|"How glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won't you have some
1|tea?" Natasha went up to her. "You have improved in looks and grown
1|more manly," continued the countess, taking her daughter's hand.
1|
1|"Mamma! What are you saying..."
1|
1|"Natasha, he is no more, no more!"
1|
1|And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first
1|time.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|Princess Mary postponed her departure. Sonya and the count tried
1|to replace Natasha but could not. They saw that she alone was able
1|to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks
1|Natasha remained constantly at her mother's side, sleeping on a lounge
1|chair in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her
1|incessantly because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones
1|soothed her mother.
1|
1|The mother's wounded spirit could not heal. Petya's
1|death had torn from her half her life. When the news of Petya's
1|death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a
1|month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no
1|interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess,
1|this second blow, restored Natasha to life.
1|
1|A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is
1|like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep
1|wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike
1|can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from
1|within.
1|
1|Natasha's wound healed in that way. She thought her life was
1|ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the
1|essence of life--love--was still active within her. Love awoke and
1|so did life.
1|
1|Prince Andrew's last days had bound Princess Mary and Natasha
1|together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another.
1|Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked
1|after Natasha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed
1|in her mother's bedroom had strained Natasha's physical strength.
1|
1|One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever, Princess Mary
1|took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Natasha lay
1|down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away
1|she called her back.
1|
1|"I don't want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little."
1|
1|"You are tired--try to sleep."
1|
1|"No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me."
1|
1|"She is much better. She spoke so well today," said Princess Mary.
1|
1|Natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
1|Princess Mary's face.
1|
1|"Is she like him?" thought Natasha. "Yes, like and yet not like. But
1|she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me.
1|What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind
1|like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!"
1|
1|"Mary," she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary's hand to herself,
1|"Mary, you mustn't think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love
1|you! Let us be quite, quite friends."
1|
1|And Natasha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making
1|Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her
1|feelings.
1|
1|From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
1|between women was established between Princess Mary and Natasha.
1|They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one
1|another and spent most of their time together. When one went out the
1|other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt
1|more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself
1|when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them;
1|an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other's
1|presence.
1|
1|Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were
1|already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They
1|spoke most of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her
1|childhood, of her mother, her father, and her daydreams; and
1|Natasha, who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly
1|turned away from that life of devotion, submission, and the poetry
1|of Christian self-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to Princess
1|Mary by affection, learned to love her past too and to understand a
1|side of life previously incomprehensible to her. She did not think
1|of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life, for she
1|was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood and loved in
1|another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For Princess
1|Mary, listening to Natasha's tales of childhood and early youth, there
1|also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life: belief
1|in life and its enjoyment.
1|
1|Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they
1|thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him
1|had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without
1|being conscious of it.
1|
1|Natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
1|talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was
1|suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,
1|and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm
1|carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her
1|drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed
1|to her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.
1|
1|One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.
1|Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and
1|then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.
1|
1|Another time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled, so she
1|called again--though she could hear Dunyasha coming--called her in the
1|deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened
1|attentively to herself.
1|
1|She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the
1|layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable,
1|delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking
1|root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed
1|her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound
1|had begun to heal from within.
1|
1|At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count
1|insisted on Natasha's going with her to consult the doctors.
1|
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|After the encounter at Vyazma, where Kutuzov had been unable to hold
1|back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy
1|and so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the
1|Russians who pursued them, continued as far as Krasnoe without a
1|battle. The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the
1|French could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke
1|down, and the information received of the movements of the French
1|was never reliable.
1|
1|The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous
1|marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not
1|go any faster.
1|
1|To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only
1|necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not
1|losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarutino and
1|less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that
1|place a hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with only fifty
1|thousand.
1|
1|The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our
1|army as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference
1|was that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of
1|destruction as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen
1|were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind
1|were among their own people. The chief cause of the wastage of
1|Napoleon's army was the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing
1|proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army.
1|
1|Kutuzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
1|movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian
1|army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
1|Tarutino and Vyazma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of
1|our army.
1|
1|But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of
1|the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident,
1|another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself
1|to Kutuzov. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French.
1|The road the French would take was unknown, and so the closer our
1|troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover.
1|Only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag
1|path of the French. All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals
1|meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches,
1|whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches. To
1|that end Kutuzov's activity was directed during the whole campaign
1|from Moscow to Vilna--not casually or intermittently but so
1|consistently that he never once deviated from it.
1|
1|Kutuzov felt and knew--not by reasoning or science but with the
1|whole of his Russian being--what every Russian soldier felt: that
1|the French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven
1|out; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the
1|hardship of this march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled for
1|such a time of the year.
1|
1|But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,
1|who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for
1|some reason to capture a king or a duke--it seemed that now--when any
1|battle must be horrible and senseless--was the very time to fight and
1|conquer somebody. Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after
1|another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those
1|soldiers--ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved--who within
1|a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their
1|number, and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a
1|greater distance than they had already traversed, before they reached
1|the frontier.
1|
1|This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow,
1|and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians
1|stumbled on the French army.
1|
1|So it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to find one of the three
1|French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen
1|thousand men. Despite all Kutuzov's efforts to avoid that ruinous
1|encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob
1|of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Krasnoe for three
1|days.
1|
1|Toll wrote a disposition: "The first column will march to so and
1|so," etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the
1|disposition. Prince Eugene of Wurttemberg fired from a hill over the
1|French crowds that were running past, and demanded reinforcements
1|which did not arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and
1|hid themselves in the forest by night, making their way round as
1|best they could, and continued their flight.
1|
1|Miloradovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the
1|commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found
1|when he was wanted--that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche* as he
1|styled himself--who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys
1|demanding their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was
1|ordered to do.
1|
1|
1|*Knight without fear and without reproach.
1|
1|
1|"I give you that column, lads," he said, riding up to the troops and
1|pointing out the French to the cavalry.
1|
1|And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
1|scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented to
1|them--that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,
1|frost-bitten, and starving--and the column that had been presented
1|to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been
1|anxious to do.
1|
1|At Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several
1|hundred cannon, and a stick called a "marshal's staff," and disputed
1|as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their
1|achievement--though they much regretted not having taken Napoleon,
1|or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, and reproached one
1|another and especially Kutuzov for having failed to do so.
1|
1|These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of
1|the most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes
1|and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable
1|deed. They blamed Kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the
1|campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he
1|thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from
1|the Linen Factories because he was comfortable there, that at
1|Krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was
1|there he had quite lost his head, and that it was probable that he had
1|an understanding with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so
1|on, and so on.
1|
1|Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk
1|in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as
1|grand, while Kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty,
1|dissolute, weak old courtier, and by Russians as something
1|indefinite--a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian
1|name.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|In 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused of blundering. The
1|Emperor was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written
1|by order of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutuzov was a
1|cunning court liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by
1|his blunders at Krasnoe and the Berezina he deprived the Russian
1|army of the glory of complete victory over the French.*
1|
1|
1|*History of the year 1812. The character of Kutuzov and
1|reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at Krasnoe,
1|by Bogdanovich.
1|
1|
1|Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian
1|mind does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary
1|individuals who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their
1|personal will to it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish
1|such men for discerning the higher laws.
1|
1|For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon--that
1|most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile,
1|showed human dignity--Napoleon is the object of adulation and
1|enthusiasm; he is grand. But Kutuzov--the man who from the beginning
1|to the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or
1|deed from Borodino to Vilna, presented an example exceptional in
1|history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future
1|importance of what was happening--Kutuzov seems to them something
1|indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of him and of the year 1812
1|they always seem a little ashamed.
1|
1|And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
1|activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be
1|difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the
1|will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find
1|an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being
1|so completely accomplished as that to which all Kutuzov's efforts were
1|directed in 1812.
1|
1|Kutuzov never talked of "forty centuries looking down from the
1|Pyramids," of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of what
1|he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said
1|nothing about himself, adopted no prose, always appeared to be the
1|simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most
1|ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de
1|Stael, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with
1|generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who
1|tried to prove anything to him. When Count Rostopchin at the Yauza
1|bridge galloped up to Kutuzov with personal reproaches for having
1|caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: "How was it you promised
1|not to abandon Moscow without a battle?" Kutuzov replied: "And I shall
1|not abandon Moscow without a battle," though Moscow was then already
1|abandoned. When Arakcheev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that
1|Ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutuzov replied:
1|"Yes, I was just saying so myself," though a moment before he had said
1|quite the contrary. What did it matter to him--who then alone amid a
1|senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what
1|was happening--what did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed
1|the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it
1|matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.
1|
1|Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man--who by
1|experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the
1|words serving as their expression are not what move people--use
1|quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head.
1|
1|But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the
1|whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single
1|aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite
1|of himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his
1|real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be
1|understood. Beginning with the battle of Borodino, from which time his
1|disagreement with those about him began, he alone said that the battle
1|of Borodino was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in
1|his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death. He alone
1|said that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to
1|Lauriston's proposal of peace, he said: There can be no peace, for
1|such is the people's will. He alone during the retreat of the French
1|said that all our maneuvers are useless, everything is being
1|accomplished of itself better than we could desire; that the enemy
1|must be offered "a golden bridge"; that neither the Tarutino, the
1|Vyazma, nor the Krasnoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some
1|force to reach the frontier with, and that he would not sacrifice a
1|single Russian for ten Frenchmen.
1|
1|And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakcheev
1|to please the Emperor, he alone--incurring thereby the Emperor's
1|displeasure--said in Vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier
1|is useless and harmful.
1|
1|Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of
1|the events. His actions--without the smallest deviation--were all
1|directed to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his
1|strength for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3)
1|to drive them out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the
1|sufferings of our people and of our army.
1|
1|This procrastinator Kutuzov, whose motto was "Patience and Time,"
1|this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodino, investing
1|the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutuzov
1|who before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be
1|lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his
1|death that Borodino was a victory, despite the assurance of generals
1|that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have
1|to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during
1|the whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then,
1|should not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the
1|frontiers of Russia crossed.
1|
1|It is easy now to understand the significance of these events--if
1|only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that
1|existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals--for the events and
1|results now lie before us.
1|
1|But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general
1|opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the
1|events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?
1|
1|The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of
1|the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he
1|possessed in full purity and strength.
1|
1|Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling
1|caused the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's wish,
1|to select him--an old man in disfavor--to be their representative in
1|the national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest
1|human pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all
1|his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing
1|pity on them.
1|
1|That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not
1|be cast in the false mold of a European hero--the supposed ruler of
1|men--that history has invented.
1|
1|To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception
1|of greatness.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle
1|of Krasnoe. Toward evening--after much disputing and many mistakes
1|made by generals who did not go to their proper places, and after
1|adjutants had been sent about with counterorders--when it had become
1|plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and
1|would be no battle, Kutuzov left Krasnoe and went to Dobroe whither
1|his headquarters had that day been transferred.
1|
1|The day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his plump
1|little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented
1|generals who whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the
1|road groups of French prisoners captured that day (there were seven
1|thousand of them) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires.
1|Near Dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with
1|talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get
1|hold of, were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed
1|French guns. At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of
1|talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutuzov who, wearing a white
1|cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round
1|shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white horse. One of
1|the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had
1|been captured.
1|
1|Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general
1|was saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he
1|gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a
1|specially wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by
1|frost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and
1|festering eyes.
1|
1|One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them,
1|one of whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of
1|raw flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial
1|in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the
1|malevolent expression with which, after a glance at Kutuzov, the
1|soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what
1|he was doing.
1|
1|Kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He
1|puckered his face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head.
1|At another spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a
1|Frenchman on the shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly
1|manner, and Kutuzov with the same expression on his face again
1|swayed his head.
1|
1|"What were you saying?" he asked the general, who continuing his
1|report directed the commander in chief's attention to some standards
1|captured from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhensk
1|regiment.
1|
1|"Ah, the standards!" said Kutuzov, evidently detaching himself
1|with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.
1|
1|He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at
1|him from all sides awaiting a word from him.
1|
1|He stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment, sighed deeply,
1|and closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers
1|carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in
1|chief with them. Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then,
1|submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his
1|position, raised his head and began to speak. A throng of officers
1|surrounded him. He looked attentively around at the circle of
1|officers, recognizing several of them.
1|
1|"I thank you all!" he said, addressing the soldiers and then again
1|the officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words
1|were distinctly heard. "I thank you all for your hard and faithful
1|service. The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor
1|to you forever."
1|
1|He paused and looked around.
1|
1|"Lower its head, lower it!" he said to a soldier who had
1|accidentally lowered the French eagle he was holding before the
1|Preobrazhensk standards. "Lower, lower, that's it. Hurrah lads!" he
1|added, addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin.
1|
1|"Hur-r-rah!" roared thousands of voices.
1|
1|While the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov leaned forward in his
1|saddle and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and
1|apparently ironic gleam.
1|
1|"You see, brothers..." said he when the shouts had ceased... and all
1|at once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no
1|longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who
1|wanted to tell his comrades something very important.
1|
1|There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of
1|the soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was
1|going to say.
1|
1|"You see, brothers, I know it's hard for you, but it can't be
1|helped! Bear up; it won't be for long now! We'll see our visitors
1|off and then we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your service. It is
1|hard for you, but still you are at home while they--you see what
1|they have come to," said he, pointing to the prisoners. "Worse off
1|than our poorest beggars. While they were strong we didn't spare
1|ourselves, but now we may even pity them. They are human beings too.
1|Isn't it so, lads?"
1|
1|He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze
1|fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew
1|brighter and brighter with an old man's mild smile, which drew the
1|corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased
1|speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity.
1|
1|"But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody
1|bastards!" he cried, suddenly lifting his head.
1|
1|And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first
1|time during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the
1|soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting "Hurrah!"
1|
1|Kutuzov's words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could
1|have repeated the field marshal's address, begun solemnly and then
1|changing into an old man's simplehearted talk; but the hearty
1|sincerity of that speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined
1|with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause,
1|exactly expressed by that old man's good-natured expletives, was not
1|merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found
1|expression in their joyous and long-sustained shouts. Afterwards
1|when one of the generals addressed Kutuzov asking whether he wished
1|his caleche to be sent for, Kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a
1|sob, being evidently greatly moved.

1|When the troops reached their night's halting place on the eighth of
1|November, the last day of the Krasnoe battles, it was already
1|growing dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional
1|lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the
1|falling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost
1|grew keener.
1|
1|An infantry regiment which had left Tarutino three thousand strong
1|but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that
1|night at its halting place--a village on the highroad. The
1|quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were
1|full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff.
1|There was only one hut available for the regimental commander.
1|
1|The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the
1|village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.
1|
1|Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its
1|lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep
1|through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village,
1|and immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of
1|branches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another
1|section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a
1|group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the
1|horses. A third section scattered through the village arranging
1|quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French corpses
1|that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and
1|thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve
1|for shelter.
1|
1|Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
1|wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.
1|
1|"Now then, all together--shove!" cried the voices, and the huge
1|surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost,
1|was seen swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked
1|more and more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had
1|been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.
1|
1|"Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That's it... Where
1|are you shoving to?"
1|
1|"Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!"
1|
1|All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to
1|sing. At the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty
1|voices roared out at once: "Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. All together!
1|Heave away, boys!..." but despite their united efforts the wattle
1|hardly moved, and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing
1|of the men was audible.
1|
1|"Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...
1|will you? You may want us one of these days."
1|
1|Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into
1|the village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about
1|thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the
1|village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of
1|the gasping men.
1|
1|"Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now..."
1|
1|Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.
1|
1|"What are you up to?" suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
1|sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.
1|"There are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you
1|foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I'll give it to you!" shouted he,
1|hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.
1|"Can't you make less noise?"
1|
1|The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and
1|wiped his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling
1|against the wattle.
1|
1|"There, how that devil hits out! He's made my face all bloody," said
1|he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.
1|
1|"Don't you like it?" said a laughing voice, and moderating their
1|tones the men moved forward.
1|
1|When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud
1|as before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.
1|
1|In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered
1|and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day
1|and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a
1|flank march to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture
1|him.
1|
1|By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place
1|the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood
1|crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers
1|flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been
1|trodden down.
1|
1|Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without
1|any orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night,
1|shelters were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being
1|boiled, and muskets and accouterments put in order.
1|
1|The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by
1|the Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket
1|rests, and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo,
1|called the roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for
1|the night--some repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some
1|stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
1|conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time--lacking warm
1|boots and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the
1|snow with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations
1|(the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)--they
1|would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.
1|
1|On the contrary, the army had never under the best material
1|conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was
1|because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were
1|sifted out of the army day by day. All the physically or morally
1|weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the
1|army--physically and mentally--remained.
1|
1|More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company
1|than anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and
1|their campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by
1|their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel.
1|
1|"Eh, Makeev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you
1|lost or have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!" shouted a
1|red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking
1|because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire. "And you,
1|Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood!" said he to another soldier.
1|
1|This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being
1|robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier they
1|called "Jackdaw," a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose
1|obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the
1|light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier
1|carrying a load of wood.
1|
1|"Bring it here--that's fine!"
1|
1|They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with
1|their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats,
1|making the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit
1|their pipes. The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood,
1|setting his arms akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and
1|deftly on the spot where he stood.
1|
1|"Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It's well that I'm a
1|musketeer..." he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.
1|
1|"Look out, your soles will fly off!" shouted the red-haired man,
1|noticing that the sole of the dancer's boot was hanging loose. "What a
1|fellow you are for dancing!"
1|
1|The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw
1|it on the fire.
1|
1|"Right enough, friend," said he, and, having sat down, took out of
1|his knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his
1|foot. "It's the steam that spoils them," he added, stretching out
1|his feet toward the fire.
1|
1|"They'll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we've
1|finished hammering them, we're to receive double kits!"
1|
1|"And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after all, it
1|seems," said one sergeant major.
1|
1|"I've had an eye on him this long while," said the other.
1|
1|"Well, he's a poor sort of soldier..."
1|
1|"But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday."
1|
1|"Yes, it's all very well, but when a man's feet are frozen how can
1|he walk?"
1|
1|"Eh? Don't talk nonsense!" said a sergeant major.
1|
1|"Do you want to be doing the same?" said an old soldier, turning
1|reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.
1|
1|"Well, you know," said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in
1|a squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the
1|fire, "a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it's death. Take
1|me, now! I've got no strength left," he added, with sudden
1|resolution turning to the sergeant major. "Tell them to send me to
1|hospital; I'm aching all over; anyway I shan't be able to keep up."
1|
1|"That'll do, that'll do!" replied the sergeant major quietly.
1|
1|The soldier said no more and the talk went on.
1|
1|"What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is
1|that not one of them had what you might call real boots on," said a
1|soldier, starting a new theme. "They were no more than make-believes."
1|
1|"The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for
1|the colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,"
1|put in the dancer. "As they turned them over one seemed still alive
1|and, would you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo."
1|
1|"But they're a clean folk, lads," the first man went on; "he was
1|white--as white as birchbark--and some of them are such fine
1|fellows, you might think they were nobles."
1|
1|"Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there."
1|
1|"But they don't understand our talk at all," said the dancer with
1|a puzzled smile. "I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in
1|his own way. A queer lot!"
1|
1|"But it's strange, friends," continued the man who had wondered at
1|their whiteness, "the peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when
1|they began burying the dead--where the battle was you know--well,
1|those dead had been lying there for nearly a month, and says the
1|peasant, 'they lie as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell
1|as a puff of powder smoke.'"
1|
1|"Was it from the cold?" asked someone.
1|
1|"You're a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If
1|it had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. 'But,'
1|he says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,' he
1|says, 'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as
1|we drag them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,' he says, 'are
1|white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.'"
1|
1|All were silent.
1|
1|"It must be from their food," said the sergeant major. "They used to
1|gobble the same food as the gentry."
1|
1|No one contradicted him.
1|
1|"That peasant near Mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were
1|all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days
1|and still didn't finish carting the dead away. And as for the
1|wolves, he says..."
1|
1|"That was a real battle," said an old soldier. "It's the only one
1|worth remembering; but since that... it's only been tormenting folk."
1|
1|"And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them
1|and, my word, they didn't let us get near before they just threw
1|down their muskets and went on their knees. 'Pardon!' they say. That's
1|only one case. They say Platov took 'Poleon himself twice. But he
1|didn't know the right charm. He catches him and catches him--no
1|good! He turns into a bird in his hands and flies away. And there's no
1|way of killing him either."
1|
1|"You're a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I come to look at you!"
1|
1|"Liar, indeed! It's the real truth."
1|
1|"If he fell into my hands, when I'd caught him I'd bury him in the
1|ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he's
1|ruined!"
1|
1|"Well, anyhow we're going to end it. He won't come here again,"
1|remarked the old soldier, yawning.
1|
1|The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to
1|sleep.
1|
1|"Look at the stars. It's wonderful how they shine! You would think
1|the women had spread out their linen," said one of the men, gazing
1|with admiration at the Milky Way.
1|
1|"That's a sign of a good harvest next year."
1|
1|"We shall want some more wood."
1|
1|"You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That's queer."
1|
1|"O Lord!"
1|
1|"What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he's
1|sprawling!"
1|
1|In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen
1|asleep could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now
1|and again exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces
1|off came a sound of general, merry laughter.
1|
1|"Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!" said one of the
1|soldiers, "and what a lot of them there are!"
1|
1|One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.
1|
1|"They're having such fun," said he, coming back. "Two Frenchies have
1|turned up. One's quite frozen and the other's an awful swaggerer. He's
1|singing songs...."
1|
1|"Oh, I'll go across and have a look...."
1|
1|And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest.
1|A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow,
1|lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.
1|
1|About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the
1|forest, and the crackling of dry branches.
1|
1|"A bear, lads," said one of the men.
1|
1|They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into
1|the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging
1|to one another.
1|
1|These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They
1|came up to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our
1|soldiers did not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an
1|officer's hat and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he
1|had been going to sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy
1|soldier with a shawl tied round his head, was stronger. He raised
1|his companion and said something, pointing to his mouth. The
1|soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the ground
1|for the sick man, and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for
1|both of them.
1|
1|The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his
1|head wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.
1|
1|When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he
1|suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the
1|soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and
1|resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire,
1|looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally
1|he emitted a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel,
1|pointing to his shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact
1|that Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer
1|who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would
1|not take a French officer into his hut to warm him, and when the
1|messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to
1|be brought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He rose and tried to walk,
1|but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held
1|him up.
1|
1|"You won't do it again, eh?" said one of the soldiers, winking and
1|turning mockingly to Ramballe.
1|
1|"Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are--a real peasant!"
1|came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.
1|
1|They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two
1|soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around
1|their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:
1|
1|"Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh,
1|my brave, kind friends," and he leaned his head against the shoulder
1|of one of the men like a child.
1|
1|Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire,
1|surrounded by the soldiers.
1|
1|Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes,
1|was wearing a woman's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round
1|his head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a
1|French song in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the
1|nearest soldier. The soldiers simply held their sides as they
1|watched him.
1|
1|"Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I'll soon pick it up. How
1|is it?" said the man--a singer and a wag--whom Morel was embracing.
1|
1|"Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!" sang Morel, winking. "Ce
1|diable a quatre..."*
1|
1|
1|*"Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy devil."
1|
1|
1|"Vivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!" repeated the soldier,
1|flourishing his arm and really catching the tune.
1|
1|"Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!" rose their rough, joyous laughter from all
1|sides.
1|
1|Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.
1|
1|"Well, go on, go on!"
1|
1|    "Qui eut le triple talent,
1|    De boire, de battre,
1|    Et d'etre un vert galant."*
1|
1|
1|*Who had a triple talent
1|
1|
1| For drinking, for fighting,
1|
1| And for being a gallant old boy...
1|
1|
1|"It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zaletaev!"
1|
1|"Ke..." Zaletaev, brought out with effort: "ke-e-e-e," he drawled,
1|laboriously pursing his lips, "le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e
1|de-tra-va-ga-la" he sang.
1|
1|"Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to
1|eat?"
1|
1|"Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after
1|starving."
1|
1|They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to
1|work on his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they
1|watched him. The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse
1|themselves with such nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side
1|of the fire, but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow
1|and glance at Morel with a smile.
1|
1|"They are men too," said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
1|coat. "Even wormwood grows on its own root."
1|
1|"O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard
1|frost...."
1|
1|They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was
1|looking at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now
1|flaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering
1|something gladsome and mysterious to one another.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical
1|progression; and that crossing of the Berezina about which so much has
1|been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and
1|not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been
1|and still is written about the Berezina, on the French side this is
1|only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities
1|their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated
1|at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory,
1|and on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg--far from the
1|seat of war--a plan (again one of Pfuel's) had been devised to catch
1|Napoleon in a strategic trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured
1|himself that all would happen according to plan, and therefore
1|insisted that it was just the crossing of the Berezina that
1|destroyed the French army. In reality the results of the crossing were
1|much less disastrous to the French--in guns and men lost--than Krasnoe
1|had been, as the figures show.
1|
1|The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in the fact
1|that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans
1|for cutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the only
1|possible line of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the
1|army demanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd
1|fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed
1|to reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was
1|impossible to block its path. This was shown not so much by the
1|arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the
1|bridges. When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from
1|Moscow and women with children who were with the French transport,
1|all--carried on by vis inertiae--pressed forward into boats and into
1|the ice-covered water and did not, surrender.
1|
1|That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of
1|pursuers was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own
1|people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite
1|place he held among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining
1|in the same pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share
1|in the necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed
1|of the fact that half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not
1|know what to do--perished of cold and hunger despite their captors'
1|desire to save them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The
1|most compassionate Russian commanders, those favorable to the
1|French--and even the Frenchmen in the Russian service--could do
1|nothing for the prisoners. The French perished from the conditions
1|to which the Russian army was itself exposed. It was impossible to
1|take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to
1|give to the French who, though not harmful, or hated, or guilty,
1|were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but they were
1|exceptions.
1|
1|Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was
1|hope. Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in
1|collective flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was
1|concentrated.
1|
1|The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
1|remnant, especially after the Berezina, on which (in consequence of
1|the Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians,
1|and the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed
1|one another and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of
1|the Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov led to
1|dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly
1|expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a
1|respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to
1|blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or
1|asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
1|formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
1|every turn.
1|
1|Because they could not understand him all these people assumed
1|that it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never
1|grasp the profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his
1|phrases (which they thought were mere phrases) about a "golden
1|bridge," about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd
1|of tatterdemalions, and so forth. They had heard all that before.
1|And all he said--that it was necessary to await provisions, or that
1|the men had no boots--was so simple, while what they proposed was so
1|complicated and clever, that it was evident that he was old and stupid
1|and that they, though not in power, were commanders of genius.
1|
1|After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and
1|Petersburg hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff
1|reached their maximum. Kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged
1|his shoulders. Only once, after the affair of the Berezina, did he get
1|angry and write to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the
1|Emperor) the following letter:
1|
1|"On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency
1|please be so good as to set off for Kaluga on receipt of this, and
1|there await further commands and appointments from His Imperial
1|Majesty."
1|
1|But after Bennigsen's departure, the Grand Duke Tsarevich
1|Constantine Pavlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the
1|beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the
1|army by Kutuzov. Now having come to the army, he informed Kutuzov of
1|the Emperor's displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the
1|slowness of their advance. The Emperor intended to join the army
1|personally in a few days' time.
1|
1|The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs--this
1|same Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against
1|the sovereign's wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and
1|heir--apparent from the army--who on his own authority and contrary to
1|the Emperor's will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now
1|realized at once that his day was over, that his part was played, and
1|that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he
1|understood this not merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on
1|the one hand that the military business in which he had played his
1|part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the
1|same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his
1|aged body and of the necessity of physical rest.
1|
1|On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his "dear
1|Vilna" as he called it. Twice during his career Kutuzov had been
1|governor of Vilna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured,
1|he found old friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of
1|which he had so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the
1|cares of army and state and, as far as the passions that seethed
1|around him allowed, immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had
1|formerly been accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that
1|had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at
1|all.
1|
1|Chichagov, one of the most zealous "cutters-off" and
1|"breakers-up," who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece
1|and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent:
1|Chichagov, noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the
1|Emperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be under an obligation to him
1|because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811
1|independently of Kutuzov, and found that peace had already been
1|concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing
1|that peace was really Kutuzov's; this Chichagov was the first to
1|meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress
1|naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he
1|handed Kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The
1|contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man
1|in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of
1|Chichagov, who knew of the accusations that were being directed
1|against Kutuzov.
1|
1|When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentally mentioned that
1|the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at
1|Borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him.
1|
1|"You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the
1|contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give
1|dinner parties," warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word
1|he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov
1|to be animated by the same desire.
1|
1|Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle
1|penetrating smile: "I meant merely to say what I said."
1|
1|Contrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov detained the greater part
1|of the army at Vilna. Those about him said that he became
1|extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that
1|town. He attended to army affairs reluctantly, left everything to
1|his generals, and while awaiting the Emperor's arrival led a
1|dissipated life.
1|
1|Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his
1|suite--Count Tolstoy, Prince Volkonski, Arakcheev, and others--the
1|Emperor reached Vilna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh
1|drove straight to the castle. In spite of the severe frost some
1|hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in
1|front of the castle, as well as a guard of honor of the Semenov
1|regiment.
1|
1|A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with
1|three foam-flecked horses, shouted "Coming!" and Konovnitsyn rushed
1|into the vestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was waiting in the hall
1|porter's little lodge.
1|
1|A minute later the old man's large stout figure in full-dress
1|uniform, his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his
1|stomach, waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its
1|peaks to the sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking
1|with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street,
1|took in his hand the report he had prepared for the Emperor.
1|
1|There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew
1|furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh
1|in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be
1|descried.
1|
1|From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating
1|effect on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all
1|over, readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up
1|and, at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the
1|sleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began
1|speaking in his smooth, ingratiating voice.
1|
1|The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head to foot,
1|frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to
1|the old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too,
1|owing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings,
1|had its usual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob.
1|
1|The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and again
1|pressing the old man's hand went with him into the castle.
1|
1|When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his
1|dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes
1|made at Krasnoe and the Berezina, and informed him of his intentions
1|for a future campaign abroad. Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark. The
1|same submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the
1|Emperor's commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before
1|settled on his face now.
1|
1|When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was
1|crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by
1|someone's voice saying:
1|
1|"Your Serene Highness!"
1|
1|Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
1|Count Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which
1|lay a small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected
1|of him.
1|
1|Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed
1|across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the
1|object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the
1|First Class.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the
1|Emperor honored by his presence. Kutuzov had received the Order of St.
1|George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest
1|honors, but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him.
1|The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set
1|that example, but everybody understood that the old man was
1|blameworthy and good-for-nothing. When Kutuzov, conforming to a custom
1|of Catherine's day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be
1|lowered at the Emperor's feet on his entering the ballroom, the
1|Emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people
1|caught the words, "the old comedian."
1|
1|The Emperor's displeasure with Kutuzov was specially increased at
1|Vilna by the fact that Kutuzov evidently could not or would not
1|understand the importance of the coming campaign.
1|
1|When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers
1|assembled about him: "You have not only saved Russia, you have saved
1|Europe!" they all understood that the war was not ended.
1|
1|Kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion
1|that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of
1|Russia, but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that
1|Russia had gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the
1|impossibility of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hardships
1|already endured by the people, of the possibility of failure and so
1|forth.
1|
1|This being the field marshal's frame of mind he was naturally
1|regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.
1|
1|To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural
1|method was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with
1|Barclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign--to transfer the
1|authority to the Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under
1|the commander in chief's feet without upsetting the old man by
1|informing him of the change.
1|
1|With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its
1|real strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll,
1|Konovnitsyn, and Ermolov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke
1|loudly of the field marshal's great weakness and failing health.
1|
1|His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
1|another. And in fact his health was poor.
1|
1|So naturally, simply, and gradually--just as he had come from Turkey
1|to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to
1|the army when he was needed there--now when his part was played out,
1|Kutuzov's place was taken by a new and necessary performer.
1|
1|The war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every
1|Russian heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.
1|
1|The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
1|movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war
1|another leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing
1|from Kutuzov's and animated by different motives.
1|
1|Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from
1|east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov had
1|been for the salvation and glory of Russia.
1|
1|Kutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or
1|Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative
1|of the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia
1|had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was
1|nothing left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the
1|representative of the national war but to die, and Kutuzov died.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the
1|physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until
1|after they were over. After his liberation he reached Orel, and on the
1|third day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was
1|laid up for three months. He had what the doctors termed "bilious
1|fever." But despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him,
1|and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.
1|
1|Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre's mind by all that
1|happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He
1|remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy,
1|internal physical distress, and pains in his feet and side. He
1|remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of
1|people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and
1|generals who questioned him, he also remembered his difficulty in
1|procuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he remembered his
1|incapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of his rescue
1|he had seen the body of Petya Rostov. That same day he had learned
1|that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodino for more
1|than a month had recently died in the Rostovs' house at Yaroslavl, and
1|Denisov who told him this news also mentioned Helene's death,
1|supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at the
1|time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its
1|significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly
1|as possible from places where people were killing one another, to some
1|peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over
1|all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orel he
1|immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw
1|in attendance on him two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had
1|come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had
1|been living on his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and
1|illness had come to look after him.
1|
1|It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost
1|the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months
1|and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
1|tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he
1|would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long
1|time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of
1|captivity. In the same way little by little he came to understand
1|the news he had been told after his rescue, about the death of
1|Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the destruction of the
1|French.
1|
1|A joyous feeling of freedom--that complete inalienable freedom
1|natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt
1|outside Moscow--filled Pierre's soul during his convalescence. He
1|was surprised to find that this inner freedom, which was independent
1|of external conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of
1|external liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without
1|acquaintances. No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere.
1|He had all he wanted: the thought of his wife which had been a
1|continual torment to him was no longer there, since she was no more.
1|
1|"Oh, how good! How splendid!" said he to himself when a cleanly laid
1|table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down
1|for the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the
1|French had gone and that his wife was no more. "Oh, how good, how
1|splendid!"
1|
1|And by old habit he asked himself the question: "Well, and what
1|then? What am I going to do?" And he immediately gave himself the
1|answer: "Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!"
1|
1|The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he
1|had continually sought to find--the aim of life--no longer existed for
1|him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
1|temporarily--he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
1|present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the
1|complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
1|this time.
1|
1|He could not see an aim, for he now had faith--not faith in any kind
1|of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living,
1|ever-manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set
1|himself. That search for an aim had been simply a search for God,
1|and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning
1|but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God
1|is here and everywhere. In his captivity he had learned that in
1|Karataev God was greater, more infinite and unfathomable than in the
1|Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons. He felt like a
1|man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds
1|what he sought at his very feet. All his life he had looked over the
1|heads of the men around him, when he should have merely looked in
1|front of him without straining his eyes.
1|
1|In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
1|infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere
1|and had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had
1|only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had
1|equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,
1|where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed
1|to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen.
1|And such had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and
1|philanthropy seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as
1|he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those distances
1|and he had there seen the same pettiness, worldliness, and
1|senselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the great, eternal,
1|and infinite in everything, and therefore--to see it and enjoy its
1|contemplation--he naturally threw away the telescope through which
1|he had till now gazed over men's heads, and gladly regarded the
1|ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around
1|him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became.
1|That dreadful question, "What for?" which had formerly destroyed all
1|his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question,
1|"What for?" a simple answer was now always ready in his soul: "Because
1|there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls from
1|a man's head."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance
1|he was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and
1|seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something
1|special of his own. The difference between his former and present self
1|was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was
1|said to him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly
1|seeking to distinguish something at a distance. At present he still
1|forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before
1|his eyes, but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and
1|seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was
1|said, though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different.
1|Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so
1|people had been inclined to avoid him. Now a smile at the joy of
1|life always played round his lips, and sympathy for others, shone in
1|his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as
1|contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his presence.
1|
1|Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he
1|talked, and seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in
1|conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him
1|their most intimate secrets.
1|
1|The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly
1|hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him
1|after the old count's death, now after staying a short time in
1|Orel--where she had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his
1|ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him--felt to her
1|surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not
1|in any way seek her approval, he merely studied her with interest.
1|Formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and
1|irony, and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had
1|shown him only the combative side of her nature; but now he seemed to
1|be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart, and,
1|mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully, she let him see the
1|hidden, kindly sides of her character.
1|
1|The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
1|successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
1|showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's cunning consisted simply in
1|finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,
1|hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.
1|
1|"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence
1|of bad people but of people such as myself," thought she.
1|
1|His servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticed the
1|change that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had
1|become much "simpler." Terenty, when he had helped him undress and
1|wished him good night, often lingered with his master's boots in his
1|hands and clothes over his arm, to see whether he would not start a
1|talk. And Pierre, noticing that Terenty wanted a chat, generally
1|kept him there.
1|
1|"Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?" he would ask.
1|
1|And Terenty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of
1|the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and
1|talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre's stories, and then would go
1|out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master
1|and affection for him.
1|
1|The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though
1|he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every
1|moment was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with
1|Pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on
1|the characters of his patients in general, and especially of the
1|ladies.
1|
1|"It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our
1|provincials," he would say.
1|
1|There were several prisoners from the French army in Orel, and the
1|doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.
1|
1|This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make
1|fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.
1|
1|The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk
1|with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love, and
1|pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially
1|against Napoleon.
1|
1|"If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight
1|such a nation," he said to Pierre. "You, who have suffered so from the
1|French, do not even feel animosity toward them."
1|
1|Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely
1|by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so
1|doing.
1|
1|During the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel his old Masonic
1|acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in
1|1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress
1|who had a large estate in Orel province, and he occupied a temporary
1|post in the commissariat department in that town.
1|
1|Hearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they had
1|never been intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship
1|and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for
1|one another. Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man
1|of his own circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.
1|
1|But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged
1|much behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself,
1|into apathy and egotism.
1|
1|"You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow," he said.
1|
1|But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had
1|been formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To
1|Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to
1|think that he had been like that himself but a short time before.
1|
1|Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family
1|affairs, his wife's affairs, and his official duties. He regarded
1|all these occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that
1|they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of
1|himself and his family. Military, administrative, political, and
1|Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre,
1|without trying to change the other's views and without condemning him,
1|but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him,
1|was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon.
1|
1|There was a new feature in Pierre's relations with Willarski, with
1|the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met,
1|which gained for him the general good will. This was his
1|acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man's convictions by
1|words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking,
1|feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view. This
1|legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and
1|irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and
1|the interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes
1|complete contradiction, between men's opinions and their lives, and
1|between one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused
1|and gentle smile.
1|
1|In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a
1|center of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary
1|questions, especially requests for money to which, as an extremely
1|wealthy man, he was very exposed, produced in him a state of
1|hopeless agitation and perplexity. "To give or not to give?" he had
1|asked himself. "I have it and he needs it. But someone else needs it
1|still more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they are both impostors?"
1|In the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these
1|surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything
1|to give. Formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with
1|regard to every question concerning his property, when one person
1|advised one thing and another something else.
1|
1|Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt
1|or perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a
1|judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should
1|not be done.
1|
1|He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he
1|felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first
1|time he had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a
1|colonel, came to him and, after talking a great deal about his
1|exploits, concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre
1|should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children.
1|Pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was
1|afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to
1|appear so insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused
1|the colonel's demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to
1|artifice when leaving Orel, to induce the Italian officer to accept
1|some money of which he was evidently in need. A further proof to
1|Pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was
1|furnished by his decision with regard to his wife's debts and to the
1|rebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow.
1|
1|His head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoned up with him
1|his diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according
1|to the head steward's calculation, about two million rubles.
1|
1|To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an
1|estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be
1|diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife's
1|debts which he was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild
1|his Moscow house and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had
1|cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.
1|
1|"Yes, of course that's true," said Pierre with a cheerful smile.
1|"I don't need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much
1|richer."
1|
1|But in January Savelich came from Moscow and gave him an account
1|of the state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect
1|had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses,
1|speaking of this as of a settled matter. About the same time he
1|received letters from Prince Vasili and other Petersburg acquaintances
1|speaking of his wife's debts. And Pierre decided that the steward's
1|proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to
1|Petersburg and settle his wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow.
1|Why this was necessary he did not know, but he knew for certain that
1|it was necessary. His income would be reduced by three fourths, but he
1|felt it must be done.
1|
1|Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.
1|
1|During the whole time of his convalescence in Orel Pierre had
1|experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his
1|journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
1|faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt
1|like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone--the stagecoach driver, the
1|post-house overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the
1|villages--had a new significance for him. The presence and remarks of
1|Willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia
1|and its backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre's
1|pleasure. Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary
1|strength and vitality--the strength which in that vast space amid the
1|snows maintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique
1|people. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with
1|him--an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions
1|that could lead to nothing--and he smiled joyfully as he listened to
1|him.

1|
1|It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has
1|been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of
1|rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they
1|jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally
1|difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of
1|the French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But
1|when we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy,
1|and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the
1|destruction of the heap, something indestructible, which though
1|intangible is the real strength of the colony, still exists; and
1|similarly, though in Moscow in the month of October there was no
1|government and no churches, shrines, riches, or houses--it was still
1|the Moscow it had been in August. All was destroyed, except something
1|intangible yet powerful and indestructible.
1|
1|The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after
1|it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and
1|at first for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all
1|had in common: a desire to get to the place that had been called
1|Moscow, to apply their activities there.
1|
1|Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in
1|a fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the
1|number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in
1|1812.
1|
1|The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of
1|Wintzingerode's detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and
1|residents who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its
1|vicinity. The Russians who entered Moscow, finding it plundered,
1|plundered it in their turn. They continued what the French had
1|begun. Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the
1|villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets.
1|The Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps, and the
1|householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it
1|to their own, pretending that it was their property.
1|
1|But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
1|contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and
1|more difficult and assumed more definite forms.
1|
1|The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of
1|regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship,
1|with luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms
1|were lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops,
1|warehouses, market stalls, granaries--for the most part still stocked
1|with goods--and there were factories and workshops, palaces and
1|wealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government
1|offices, churches, and cathedrals. The longer the French remained the
1|more these forms of town life perished, until finally all was merged
1|into one confused, lifeless scene of plunder.
1|
1|The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the
1|wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But
1|plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city
1|began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater
1|the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
1|of the city and its regular life restored.
1|
1|Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by
1|curiosity, some by official duties, some by self-interest--house
1|owners, clergy, officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and
1|peasants--streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart.
1|
1|Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
1|plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses
1|out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades'
1|discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat
1|down one another's prices to below what they had been in former
1|days. Gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow
1|every day, and on all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built,
1|and old, charred ones repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths.
1|Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses. The
1|clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned.
1|Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen. Government
1|clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of
1|documents in small rooms. The higher authorities and the police
1|organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French. The
1|owners of houses in which much property had been left, brought there
1|from other houses, complained of the injustice of taking everything to
1|the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin; others insisted that as the
1|French had gathered things from different houses into this or that
1|house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was
1|found there. They abused the police and bribed them, made out
1|estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had
1|perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchin
1|wrote proclamations.
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex
1|of his house which had not been burned. He called on Count
1|Rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he
1|intended to leave for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was
1|celebrating the victory, everything was bubbling with life in the
1|ruined but reviving city. Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone
1|wished to meet him, and everyone questioned him about what he had
1|seen. Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all, but
1|was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in
1|any way. To all questions put to him--whether important or quite
1|trifling--such as: Where would he live? Was he going to rebuild?
1|When was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel
1|for someone?--he replied: "Yes, perhaps," or, "I think so," and so on.
1|
1|He had heard that the Rostovs were at Kostroma but the thought of
1|Natasha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant
1|memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from
1|social obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him,
1|he had aroused in himself.
1|
1|On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskoys
1|that Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days
1|of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's thoughts and now recurred
1|to him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary
1|was in Moscow and living in her house--which had not been burned--in
1|Vozdvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.
1|
1|On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of
1|their friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially
1|of the last one at Borodino.
1|
1|"Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then
1|in? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him
1|before he died?" thought Pierre. He recalled Karataev and his death
1|and involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and
1|yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the
1|love he felt for both of them.
1|
1|Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious
1|mood. The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but
1|its general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with
1|a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
1|of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the
1|house, informed him that the princess had gone to her own
1|apartments, and that she received on Sundays.
1|
1|"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me," said Pierre.
1|
1|"Yes, sir," said the man. "Please step into the portrait gallery."
1|
1|A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought
1|word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he
1|would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.
1|
1|In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
1|another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess
1|always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were
1|like he never knew or remembered. "This must be one of her
1|companions," he thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.
1|
1|The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.
1|
1|"Yes," she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her
1|hand, "so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the
1|very last," she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion
1|with a shyness that surprised him for an instant.
1|
1|"I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of
1|good news we had received for a long time."
1|
1|Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
1|uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre
1|interrupted her.
1|
1|"Just imagine--I knew nothing about him!" said he. "I thought he had
1|been killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only
1|know that he fell in with the Rostovs.... What a strange coincidence!"
1|
1|Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the
1|companion's face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,
1|as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion
1|in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would
1|not hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.
1|
1|But when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expressed
1|still greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre's
1|face to that of the lady in the black dress and said:
1|
1|"Do you really not recognize her?"
1|
1|Pierre looked again at the companion's pale, delicate face with
1|its black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long
1|forgotten and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive
1|eyes.
1|
1|"But no, it can't be!" he thought. "This stern, thin, pale face that
1|looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her."
1|But at that moment Princess Mary said, "Natasha!" And with difficulty,
1|effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its
1|hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from
1|that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre
1|with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even
1|been thinking--especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him,
1|and enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer
1|possible, it was Natasha and he loved her.
1|
1|At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess
1|Mary, and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had
1|been unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He
1|tried to hide his agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more
1|clearly--clearer than any words could have done--did he betray to
1|himself, to her, and to Princess Mary that he loved her.
1|
1|"No, it's only the unexpectedness of it," thought Pierre. But as
1|soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with
1|Princess Mary he again glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush
1|suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and
1|fear seized his soul. He became confused in his speech and stopped
1|in the middle of what he was saying.
1|
1|Pierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not at all expect
1|to see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the
1|change in her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin
1|and pale, but that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was
1|unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose
1|eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life,
1|now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least
1|shadow of a smile: only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly
1|interrogative.
1|
1|Pierre's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's
1|part, but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her
1|whole face.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|"She has come to stay with me," said Princess Mary. "The count and
1|countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful
1|state; but it was necessary for Natasha herself to see a doctor.
1|They insisted on her coming with me."
1|
1|"Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?" said Pierre,
1|addressing Natasha. "You know it happened the very day we were
1|rescued. I saw him. What a delightful boy he was!"
1|
1|Natasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes
1|widened and lit up.
1|
1|"What can one say or think of as a consolation?" said Pierre.
1|"Nothing! Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?"
1|
1|"Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith..."
1|remarked Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, that is really true," Pierre hastily interrupted her.
1|
1|"Why is it true?" Natasha asked, looking attentively into Pierre's
1|eyes.
1|
1|"How can you ask why?" said Princess Mary. "The thought alone of
1|what awaits..."
1|
1|Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked
1|inquiringly at Pierre.
1|
1|"And because," Pierre continued, "only one who believes that there
1|is a God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours."
1|
1|Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly
1|stopped. Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed
1|Princess Mary, asking about his friend's last days.
1|
1|Pierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time
1|he felt that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that
1|there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment
1|mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world. As he
1|spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on
1|Natasha. He did not purposely say things to please her, but whatever
1|he was saying he regarded from her standpoint.
1|
1|Princess Mary--reluctantly as is usual in such cases--began
1|telling of the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But
1|Pierre's face quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager
1|restless expression, gradually compelled her to go into details
1|which she feared to recall for her own sake.
1|
1|"Yes, yes, and so...?" Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her
1|with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. "Yes, yes... so
1|he grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always
1|sought one thing--to be perfectly good--so he could not be afraid of
1|death. The faults he had--if he had any--were not of his making. So he
1|did soften?... What a happy thing that he saw you again," he added,
1|suddenly turning to Natasha and looking at her with eyes full of
1|tears.
1|
1|Natasha's face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a
1|moment. She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.
1|
1|"Yes, that was happiness," she then said in her quiet voice with its
1|deep chest notes. "For me it certainly was happiness." She paused.
1|"And he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I
1|entered the room...."
1|
1|Natasha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her
1|knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted
1|her head and began to speak rapidly.
1|
1|"We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare
1|to ask about him. Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with
1|us. I had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I
1|wanted was to see him and be with him," she said, trembling, and
1|breathing quickly.
1|
1|And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she
1|had never yet mentioned to anyone--all she had lived through during
1|those three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslavl.
1|
1|Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full
1|of tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of
1|death, nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only
1|pity for her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.
1|
1|Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat
1|beside Natasha, and heard for the first time the story of those last
1|days of her brother's and Natasha's love.
1|
1|Evidently Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.
1|
1|She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate
1|secrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish.
1|Several times she repeated the same thing twice.
1|
1|Dessalles' voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
1|Nicholas might come in to say good night.
1|
1|"Well, that's all--everything," said Natasha.
1|
1|She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the
1|door which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and
1|rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.
1|
1|Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did
1|not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.
1|
1|Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his
1|attention to her nephew who had entered the room.
1|
1|At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas' face, which
1|resembled his father's, affected Pierre so much that when he had
1|kissed the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and
1|went to the window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but
1|she would not let him go.
1|
1|"No, Natasha and I sometimes don't go to sleep till after two, so
1|please don't go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come
1|immediately."
1|
1|Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: "This is the
1|first time she has talked of him like that."
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVII
1|
1|
1|Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few
1|minutes later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with
1|Natasha. Natasha was calm, though a severe and grave expression had
1|again settled on her face. They all three of them now experienced that
1|feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and
1|heartfelt talk. It is impossible to go back to the same
1|conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to
1|speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went
1|silently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up
1|again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break
1|the silence, looked at Natasha and at Princess Mary. They had
1|evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with
1|satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy.
1|
1|"Do you take vodka, Count?" asked Princess Mary, and those words
1|suddenly banished the shadows of the past. "Now tell us about
1|yourself," said she. "One hears such improbable wonders about you."
1|
1|"Yes," replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to
1|him. "They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary
1|Abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had
1|happened, or ought to have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also
1|instructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I have
1|noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I am an
1|interesting man now); people invite me out and tell me all about
1|myself."
1|
1|Natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.
1|
1|"We have been told," Princess Mary interrupted her, "that you lost
1|two millions in Moscow. Is that true?"
1|
1|"But I am three times as rich as before," returned Pierre.
1|
1|Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his
1|wife's debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that
1|he had become three times as rich as before.
1|
1|"What I have certainly gained is freedom," he began seriously, but
1|did not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.
1|
1|"And are you building?"
1|
1|"Yes. Savelich says I must!"
1|
1|"Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when you decided
1|to remain in Moscow?" asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed,
1|noticing that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed
1|to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.
1|
1|"No," answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning
1|Princess Mary had given to his words. "I heard of it in Orel and you
1|cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple," he
1|added quickly, glancing at Natasha and noticing on her face
1|curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife, "but her death shocked
1|me terribly. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault,
1|and one's own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other
1|is no longer alive. And then such a death... without friends and
1|without consolation! I am very, very sorry for her," he concluded, and
1|was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Natasha's face.
1|
1|"Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor," said
1|Princess Mary.
1|
1|Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to
1|look at Natasha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was
1|cold, stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.
1|
1|"And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been
1|told?" said Princess Mary.
1|
1|Pierre laughed.
1|
1|"No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken
1|prisoner means being Napoleon's guest. Not only did I never see him
1|but I heard nothing about him--I was in much lower company!"
1|
1|Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his
1|captivity was gradually led on to do so.
1|
1|"But it's true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?"
1|Natasha asked with a slight smile. "I guessed it then when we met at
1|the Sukharev tower, do you remember?"
1|
1|Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by
1|Princess Mary's questions and especially by Natasha's into giving a
1|detailed account of his adventures.
1|
1|At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary
1|with him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he
1|came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
1|unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
1|emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he
1|has lived through.
1|
1|Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at
1|Natasha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his
1|goodness. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face
1|constantly changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an
1|attention that never wandered--evidently herself experiencing all that
1|he described. Not only her look, but her exclamations and the brief
1|questions she put, showed Pierre that she understood just what he
1|wished to convey. It was clear that she understood not only what he
1|said but also what he wished to, but could not, express in words.
1|The account Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman
1|for protecting whom he was arrested was this: "It was an awful
1|sight--children abandoned, some in the flames... One was snatched
1|out before my eyes... and there were women who had their things
1|snatched off and their earrings torn out..." he flushed and grew
1|confused. "Then a patrol arrived and all the men--all those who were
1|not looting, that is--were arrested, and I among them."
1|
1|"I am sure you're not telling us everything; I am sure you did
1|something..." said Natasha and pausing added, "something fine?"
1|
1|Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass
1|over the horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he should not
1|omit anything.
1|
1|Pierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused. By this time he had
1|risen from the table and was pacing the room, Natasha following him
1|with her eyes. Then he added:
1|
1|"No, you can't understand what I learned from that illiterate
1|man--that simple fellow."
1|
1|"Yes, yes, go on!" said Natasha. "Where is he?"
1|
1|"They killed him almost before my eyes."
1|
1|And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of
1|the last days of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his death.
1|
1|He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now,
1|as it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that
1|he was telling it all to Natasha he experienced that pleasure which
1|a man has when women listen to him--not clever women who when
1|listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their
1|minds and when opportunity offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt
1|it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own
1|clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop--but the
1|pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and
1|absorb the very best a man shows of himself. Natasha without knowing
1|it was all attention: she did not lose a word, no single quiver in
1|Pierre's voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor a
1|single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its flight and
1|took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret meaning of
1|all Pierre's mental travail.
1|
1|Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she
1|now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the
1|possibility of love and happiness between Natasha and Pierre, and
1|the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.
1|
1|It was three o'clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad
1|and stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.
1|
1|Pierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at him intently
1|with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to
1|understand something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre
1|in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and
1|tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess
1|Mary was silent. It occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock
1|and time to go to bed.
1|
1|"People speak of misfortunes and sufferings," remarked Pierre,
1|"but if at this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather be what you
1|were before you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?'
1|then for heaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh!
1|We imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is
1|lost, but it is only then that what is new and good begins. While
1|there is life there is happiness. There is much, much before us. I say
1|this to you," he added, turning to Natasha.
1|
1|"Yes, yes," she said, answering something quite different. "I too
1|should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning."
1|
1|Pierre looked intently at her.
1|
1|"Yes, and nothing more," said Natasha.
1|
1|"It's not true, not true!" cried Pierre. "I am not to blame for
1|being alive and wishing to live--nor you either."
1|
1|Suddenly Natasha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and
1|began to cry.
1|
1|"What is it, Natasha?" said Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Nothing, nothing." She smiled at Pierre through her tears. "Good
1|night! It is time for bed."
1|
1|Pierre rose and took his leave.
1|
1|
1|Princess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked
1|of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her
1|opinion of Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him.
1|
1|"Well, good night, Mary!" said Natasha. "Do you know, I am often
1|afraid that by not speaking of him" (she meant Prince Andrew) "for
1|fear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him."
1|
1|Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice
1|of Natasha's remark, but she did not express agreement in words.
1|
1|"Is it possible to forget?" said she.
1|
1|"It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard
1|and painful, but good, very good!" said Natasha. "I am sure he
1|really loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?" she
1|added, suddenly blushing.
1|
1|"To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!" said
1|Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Do you know, Mary..." Natasha suddenly said with a mischievous
1|smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long
1|time, "he has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if he
1|had just come out of a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral
1|bath. Isn't it true?"
1|
1|"Yes," replied Princess Mary. "He has greatly improved."
1|
1|"With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as
1|if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to..."
1|
1|"I understand why he" (Prince Andrew) "liked no one so much as him,"
1|said Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when
1|they are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike
1|him--in everything."
1|
1|"Yes, but he's wonderful."
1|
1|"Well, good night," said Natasha.
1|
1|And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her
1|face as if it had been forgotten there.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVIII
1|
1|
1|It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He
1|paced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult
1|problem and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and
1|wincing, and now smiling happily.
1|
1|He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, and of their love,
1|at one moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that
1|feeling. It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and
1|down the room.
1|
1|"Well, what's to be done if it cannot be avoided? What's to be done?
1|Evidently it has to be so," said he to himself, and hastily undressing
1|he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
1|indecision.
1|
1|"Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do
1|everything that she and I may be man and wife," he told himself.
1|
1|A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on
1|the Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savelich came to ask him
1|about packing for the journey.
1|
1|"What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in
1|Petersburg?" he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. "Oh, yes,
1|long ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to
1|Petersburg," he reflected. "Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good
1|fellow he is and how attentive, and how he remembers everything," he
1|thought, looking at Savelich's old face, "and what a pleasant smile he
1|has!"
1|
1|"Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?"
1|Pierre asked him.
1|
1|"What's the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under
1|the late count--the kingdom of heaven be his!--and we have lived under
1|you too, without ever being wronged."
1|
1|"And your children?"
1|
1|"The children will live just the same. With such masters one can
1|live."
1|
1|"But what about my heirs?" said Pierre. "Supposing I suddenly
1|marry... it might happen," he added with an involuntary smile.
1|
1|"If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good
1|thing."
1|
1|"How easy he thinks it," thought Pierre. "He doesn't know how
1|terrible it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is
1|terrible!"
1|
1|"So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?" asked
1|Savelich.
1|
1|"No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. You must
1|forgive the trouble I have put you to," said Pierre, and seeing
1|Savelich smile, he thought: "But how strange it is that he should
1|not know that now there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be
1|settled first of all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only
1|pretending. Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?"
1|Pierre reflected. "No, another time."
1|
1|At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had
1|been to see Princess Mary the day before and had there met--"Whom do
1|you think? Natasha Rostova!"
1|
1|The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than
1|if he had seen Anna Semenovna.
1|
1|"Do you know her?" asked Pierre.
1|
1|"I have seen the princess," she replied. "I heard that they were
1|arranging a match for her with young Rostov. It would be a very good
1|thing for the Rostovs, they are said to be utterly ruined."
1|
1|"No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?"
1|
1|"I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great
1|pity."
1|
1|"No, she either doesn't understand or is pretending," thought
1|Pierre. "Better not say anything to her either."
1|
1|The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre's journey.
1|
1|"How kind they all are," thought Pierre. "What is surprising is that
1|they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
1|interest to them. And all for me!"
1|
1|On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him
1|to send a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things
1|that were to be returned to their owners that day.
1|
1|"And this man too," thought Pierre, looking into the face of the
1|Chief of Police. "What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind.
1|Fancy bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is
1|not honest and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn't
1|he take bribes? That's the way he was brought up, and everybody does
1|it. But what a kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at
1|me."
1|
1|Pierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner.
1|
1|As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
1|down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The
1|picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the
1|burned-out quarters of the town, stretching out and concealing one
1|another, reminded him of the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he
1|met and their passengers, the carpenters cutting the timber for new
1|houses with axes, the women hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked
1|at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: "Ah, there he
1|is! Let's see what will come of it!"
1|
1|At the entrance to Princess Mary's house Pierre felt doubtful
1|whether he had really been there the night before and really seen
1|Natasha and talked to her. "Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall
1|go in and find no one there." But he had hardly entered the room
1|before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his
1|sense of freedom. She was in the same black dress with soft folds
1|and her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet she was
1|quite different. Had she been like this when he entered the day before
1|he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her.
1|
1|She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince
1|Andrew's fiancee. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on
1|her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.
1|
1|Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there,
1|but Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house
1|with her.
1|
1|Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening.
1|Though Princess Mary and Natasha were evidently glad to see their
1|visitor and though all Pierre's interest was now centered in that
1|house, by the evening they had talked over everything and the
1|conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly
1|broke off. He stayed so long that Princess Mary and Natasha
1|exchanged glances, evidently wondering when he would go. Pierre
1|noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy and embarrassed, but sat
1|on because he simply could not get up and take his leave.
1|
1|Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and
1|complaining of a headache began to say good night.
1|
1|"So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?" she asked.
1|
1|"No, I am not going," Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone
1|and as though offended. "Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow--but I
1|won't say good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any
1|commissions for me," said he, standing before Princess Mary and
1|turning red, but not taking his departure.
1|
1|Natasha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other
1|hand instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly
1|and intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had
1|plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and
1|long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.
1|
1|When Natasha left the room Pierre's confusion and awkwardness
1|immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly
1|moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.
1|
1|"Yes, I wanted to tell you," said he, answering her look as if she
1|had spoken. "Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess,
1|my dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of
1|her, I know it's impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a
1|brother to her. No, not that, I don't, I can't..."
1|
1|He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.
1|
1|"Well," he went on with an evident effort at self-control and
1|coherence. "I don't know when I began to love her, but I have loved
1|her and her alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine
1|life without her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the
1|thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be
1|missing that possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell
1|me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!" he added
1|after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply.
1|
1|"I am thinking of what you have told me," answered Princess Mary.
1|"This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love
1|at present..."
1|
1|Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love
1|was impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden
1|change in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be
1|hurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she
1|wished for.
1|
1|"To speak to her now wouldn't do," said the princess all the same.
1|
1|"But what am I to do?"
1|
1|"Leave it to me," said Princess Mary. "I know..."
1|
1|Pierre was looking into Princess Mary's eyes.
1|
1|"Well?... Well?..." he said.
1|
1|"I know that she loves... will love you," Princess Mary corrected
1|herself.
1|
1|Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a
1|frightened expression seized Princess Mary's hand.
1|
1|"What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?"
1|
1|"Yes, I think so," said Princess Mary with a smile. "Write to her
1|parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it
1|to happen and my heart tells me it will."
1|
1|"No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can't be.... How happy I
1|am! No, it can't be!" Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess
1|Mary's hands.
1|
1|"Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,"
1|she said.
1|
1|"To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I'll go. But I may come again
1|tomorrow?"
1|
1|Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Natasha was less animated
1|than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her
1|Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor
1|she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. "Is it
1|possible? No, it can't be," he told himself at every look, gesture,
1|and word that filled his soul with joy.
1|
1|When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could
1|not help holding it a little longer in his own.
1|
1|"Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this
1|treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that
1|it will one day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to
1|myself?... No, that's impossible!..."
1|
1|"Good-by, Count," she said aloud. "I shall look forward very much to
1|your return," she added in a whisper.
1|
1|And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face
1|which accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of
1|inexhaustible memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for
1|Pierre. "'I shall look forward very much to your return....' Yes, yes,
1|how did she say it? Yes, 'I shall look forward very much to your
1|return.' Oh, how happy I am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!"
1|said Pierre to himself.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIX
1|
1|
1|There was nothing in Pierre's soul now at all like what had troubled
1|it during his courtship of Helene.
1|
1|He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the
1|words he had spoken, or say: "Oh, why did I not say that?" and,
1|"Whatever made me say 'Je vous aime'?" On the contrary, he now
1|repeated in imagination every word that he or Natasha had spoken and
1|pictured every detail of her face and smile, and did not wish to
1|diminish or add anything, but only to repeat it again and again. There
1|was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had
1|undertaken was right or wrong. Only one terrible doubt sometimes
1|crossed his mind: "Wasn't it all a dream? Isn't Princess Mary
1|mistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I believe all
1|this--and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be sure
1|to smile and say: 'How strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn't
1|he know that he is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something
1|altogether different and higher.'"
1|
1|That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now
1|make any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable
1|that if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things.
1|Everything ended with that.
1|
1|A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself
1|incapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life--not for him alone
1|but for the whole world--seemed to him centered in his love and the
1|possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to
1|be occupied with one thing only--his future happiness. Sometimes it
1|seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was
1|himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be
1|busy with other interests. In every word and gesture he saw
1|allusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met by his
1|significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a
1|secret understanding between him and them. And when he realized that
1|people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his
1|whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that
1|occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.
1|
1|When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,
1|or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
1|assumption that everybody's welfare depended on this or that issue
1|of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and
1|surprise people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw
1|everybody--both those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning
1|of life (that is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who
1|evidently did not understand it--in the bright light of the emotion
1|that shone within himself, and at once without any effort saw in
1|everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved.
1|
1|When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her
1|memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the
1|bliss he now knew. Prince Vasili, who having obtained a new post and
1|some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed
1|to him a pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.
1|
1|Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity.
1|All the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained
1|true for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently,
1|but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the
1|views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved
1|correct.
1|
1|"I may have appeared strange and queer then," he thought, "but I was
1|not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had
1|more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is
1|worth understanding in life, because... because I was happy."
1|
1|Pierre's insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to
1|discover personal attributes which he termed "good qualities" in
1|people before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love,
1|and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes
1|for loving them.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XX
1|
1|
1|After Pierre's departure that first evening, when Natasha had said
1|to Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: "He looks just, yes, just
1|as if he had come out of a Russian bath--in a short coat and with
1|his hair cropped," something hidden and unknown to herself, but
1|irrepressible, awoke in Natasha's soul.
1|
1|Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.
1|To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to
1|the surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to
1|have forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer
1|complained of her position, did not say a word about the past, and
1|no longer feared to make happy plans for the future. She spoke
1|little of Pierre, but when Princess Mary mentioned him a
1|long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips
1|curved with a strange smile.
1|
1|The change that took place in Natasha at first surprised Princess
1|Mary; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. "Can she
1|have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so
1|soon?" she thought when she reflected on the change. But when she
1|was with Natasha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach
1|her. The reawakened power of life that had seized Natasha was so
1|evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence
1|Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her
1|heart.
1|
1| Natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling
1|that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad,
1|but bright and cheerful.
1|
1|When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk
1|with Pierre, Natasha met her on the threshold.
1|
1|"He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?" she repeated.
1|
1|And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness
1|for her joy settled on Natasha's face.
1|
1|"I wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me."
1|
1|Understandable and touching as the look with which Natasha gazed
1|at her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her
1|agitation, these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her
1|brother and his love.
1|
1|"But what's to be done? She can't help it," thought the princess.
1|
1|And with a sad and rather stern look she told Natasha all that
1|Pierre had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Natasha
1|was astounded.
1|
1|"To Petersburg!" she repeated as if unable to understand.
1|
1|But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary's face she
1|guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.
1|
1|"Mary," said she, "tell me what I should do! I am afraid of being
1|bad. Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me...."
1|
1|"You love him?"
1|
1|"Yes," whispered Natasha.
1|
1|"Then why are you crying? I am happy for your sake," said Princess
1|Mary, who because of those tears quite forgave Natasha's joy.
1|
1|"It won't be just yet--someday. Think what fun it will be when I
1|am his wife and you marry Nicholas!"
1|
1|"Natasha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about
1|you."
1|
1|They were silent awhile.
1|
1|"But why go to Petersburg?" Natasha suddenly asked, and hastily
1|replied to her own question. "But no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He
1|must...."
1|

1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had
1|subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the
1|mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of
1|their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.
1|
1|Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the
1|movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time.
1|Various groups of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation
1|and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in
1|course of preparation.
1|
1|The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to
1|shore as previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures
1|were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before.
1|They now seemed to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the
1|head of armies, who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by
1|ordering wars, campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless
1|movement by political and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.
1|
1|The historians call this activity of the historical figures "the
1|reaction."
1|
1|In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
1|personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the
1|reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and
1|Napoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte,
1|Chateaubriand, and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and
1|are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to
1|progress or to reaction.
1|
1|According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in
1|Russia also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who
1|according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the
1|commencement of his reign, being the savior of Russia.
1|
1|There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist
1|to learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander
1|for things he did wrong at this period of his reign.
1|
1|"He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he
1|did well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning
1|of his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution
1|to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakcheev,
1|favoring Golitsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkov and
1|Photius. He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active
1|army and disbanding the Semenov regiment."
1|
1|It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
1|historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good
1|for humanity.
1|
1|What do these reproaches mean?
1|
1|Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander
1|I (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle
1|with Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of
1|1813) flow from the same sources--the circumstances of his birth,
1|education, and life--that made his personality what it was and from
1|which the actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the
1|restoration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also
1|flowed?
1|
1|In what does the substance of those reproaches lie?
1|
1|It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,
1|standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the
1|blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to
1|those strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and
1|self-deception inseparable from power; a character who at every moment
1|of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in
1|Europe; and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man
1|had his personal habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness,
1|beauty, and truth--that this character--though not lacking in virtue
1|(the historians do not accuse him of that)--had not the same
1|conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day
1|professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with
1|learning: that is, with books and lectures and with taking notes
1|from them.
1|
1|But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was
1|mistaken in his view of what was good for the people, we must
1|inevitably assume that the historian who judges Alexander will also
1|after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of
1|what is good for humanity. This assumption is all the more natural and
1|inevitable because, watching the movement of history, we see that
1|every year and with each new writer, opinion as to what is good for
1|mankind changes; so that what once seemed good, ten years later
1|seems bad, and vice versa. And what is more, we find at one and the
1|same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good
1|in history: some people regard giving a constitution to Poland and
1|forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in Alexander, while others
1|regard it as blameworthy.
1|
1|The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful
1|or harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or
1|harmful. If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it
1|does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether
1|the preservation of my father's house in Moscow, or the glory of the
1|Russian arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other
1|universities, or the freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia,
1|or the balance of power in Europe, or a certain kind of European
1|culture called "progress" appear to me to be good or bad, I must admit
1|that besides these things the action of every historic character has
1|other more general purposes inaccessible to me.
1|
1|But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
1|contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
1|which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander
1|could have done everything differently; let us say that with
1|guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate
1|aim of the movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters
1|according to the program his present accusers would have given him--of
1|nationality, freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover
1|the ground). Let us assume that this program was possible and had then
1|been formulated, and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then
1|have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that
1|then prevailed in the government--an activity that in the opinion of
1|the historians was good and beneficent? Their activity would not
1|have existed: there would have been no life, there would have been
1|nothing.
1|
1|If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the
1|possibility of life is destroyed.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to
1|the attainment of certain ends--the greatness of Russia or of
1|France, the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas
1|of the Revolution, general progress, or anything else--then it is
1|impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the
1|conceptions of chance and genius.
1|
1|If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth
1|century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have
1|been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the
1|invasion. If the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have
1|been attained without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the
1|aim was the dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have
1|accomplished that much better than warfare. If the aim was the
1|progress of civilization, it is easy to see that there are other
1|ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the
1|destruction of wealth and of human lives.
1|
1|Why did it happen in this and not in some other way?
1|
1|Because it happened so! "Chance created the situation; genius
1|utilized it," says history.
1|
1|But what is chance? What is genius?
1|
1|The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing
1|thing and therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a
1|certain stage of understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a
1|certain event occurs; I think that I cannot know it; so I do not try
1|to know it and I talk about chance. I see a force producing effects
1|beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies; I do not understand why
1|this occurs and I talk of genius.
1|
1|To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
1|special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the
1|others must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing
1|conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances
1|that this ram, who instead of getting into the general fold every
1|evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats--that
1|this very ram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat.
1|
1|But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to
1|them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they
1|need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes
1|beyond their ken, and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence
1|in what happened to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not
1|know for what purpose they are fattened, they will at least know
1|that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally, and
1|will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius.
1|
1|Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
1|intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond
1|our ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of
1|historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they
1|produce (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then
1|the words chance and genius become superfluous.
1|
1|We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European
1|convulsions and that we know only the facts--that is, the murders,
1|first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria,
1|in Spain, and in Russia--and that the movements from the west to the
1|east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of
1|these events, and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional
1|ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable
1|to consider them to be anything but like other men, and we shall not
1|be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those
1|small events which made these people what they were, but it will be
1|clear that all those small events were inevitable.
1|
1|By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall
1|clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
1|any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it
1|is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down
1|to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than
1|Napoleon and Alexander with all their antecedents.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of
1|the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the
1|mass of the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from
1|east to west. The commencement of that movement was the movement
1|from west to east. For the peoples of the west to be able to make
1|their warlike movement to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they
1|should form themselves into a military group of a size able to
1|endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east, (2)
1|that they should abandon all established traditions and customs, and
1|(3) that during their military movement they should have at their head
1|a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions,
1|robberies, and murders which would have to be committed during that
1|movement.
1|
1|And beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately
1|large group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions,
1|and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new
1|customs and traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at
1|the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all
1|that had to be done.
1|
1|A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions,
1|without a name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges--by what seem the
1|strangest chances--from among all the seething French parties, and
1|without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent
1|position.
1|
1|The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance
1|of his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling
1|and self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of
1|the army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent
1|to Italy, his opponents' reluctance to fight, and his own childish
1|audacity and self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable
1|so called chances accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he
1|falls with the rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts
1|to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received
1|into the Russian service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes
1|to nothing. During the war in Italy he is several times on the verge
1|of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing
1|to various diplomatic considerations the Russian armies--just those
1|which might have destroyed his prestige--do not appear upon the
1|scene till he is no longer there.
1|
1|On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process
1|of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped
1|out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous
1|position presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless
1|expedition to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him.
1|Impregnable Malta surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes
1|are crowned with success. The enemy's fleet, which subsequently did
1|not let a single boat pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In
1|Africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost
1|unarmed inhabitants. And the men who commit these crimes, especially
1|their leader, assure themselves that this is admirable, this is
1|glory--it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great and is therefore
1|good.
1|
1|This ideal of glory and grandeur--which consists not merely in
1|considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on
1|every crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible
1|supernatural significance--that ideal, destined to guide this man
1|and his associates, had scope for its development in Africa.
1|Whatever he does succeeds. The plague does not touch him. The
1|cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. His
1|childishly rash, uncalled-for, and ignoble departure from Africa,
1|leaving his comrades in distress, is set down to his credit, and again
1|the enemy's fleet twice lets him slip past. When, intoxicated by the
1|crimes he has committed so successfully, he reaches Paris, the
1|dissolution of the republican government, which a year earlier might
1|have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and his presence there
1|now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to
1|exalt him--and though he himself has no plan, he is quite ready for
1|his new role.
1|
1|He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties
1|snatched at him and demanded his participation.
1|
1|He alone--with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy
1|and Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and
1|frankness in lying--he alone could justify what had to be done.
1|
1|He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from
1|his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his
1|mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
1|the conspiracy is crowned with success.
1|
1|He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes
1|to flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon
1|and says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once
1|proud and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played
1|out, are even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they
1|should have said to destroy him and retain their power.
1|
1|Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by
1|agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the
1|characters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms
1|the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government;
1|chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him
1|but confirms his power. Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and
1|unexpectedly causes him to kill him--thereby convincing the mob more
1|forcibly than in any other way that he had the right, since he had the
1|might. Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to
1|prepare an expedition against England (which would inevitably have
1|ruined him) he never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly
1|falls upon Mack and the Austrians, who surrender without a battle.
1|Chance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance
1|all men, not only the French but all Europe--except England which does
1|not take part in the events about to happen--despite their former
1|horror and detestation of his crimes, now recognize his authority, the
1|title he has given himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which
1|seems excellent and reasonable to them all.
1|
1|As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement,
1|the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806,
1|1807, and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of
1|people that had formed in France unites into one group with the
1|peoples of Central Europe. The strength of the justification of the
1|man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased
1|size of the group. During the ten-year preparatory period this man had
1|formed relations with all the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited
1|rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate
1|Napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur. One after another they
1|hasten to display their insignificance before him. The King of Prussia
1|sends his wife to seek the great man's mercy; the Emperor of Austria
1|considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the Caesars
1|into his bed; the Pope, the guardian of all that the nations hold
1|sacred, utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man.
1|It is not Napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of
1|his role, so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on
1|himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to
1|happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud he commits, which in
1|the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great
1|deed. The most suitable fete the Germans can devise for him is a
1|celebration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he great, but so are
1|his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his brothers-in-law.
1|Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and
1|to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so too
1|are the forces.
1|
1|The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal--Moscow.
1|That city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the
1|opposing armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to
1|Wagram. But suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which
1|hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of
1|successes to the predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of
1|inverse chances occur--from the cold in his head at Borodino to the
1|sparks which set Moscow on fire, and the frosts--and instead of
1|genius, stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident.
1|
1|The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are
1|now not for Napoleon but always against him.
1|
1|A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
1|remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
1|Attempted drives from east to west--similar to the contrary
1|movements of 1805, 1807, and 1809--precede the great westward
1|movement; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous
1|dimensions; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe to the
1|movement; the same hesitation midway, and the same increasing rapidity
1|as the goal is approached.
1|
1|Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government
1|and army are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any
1|account; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again
1|an inexplicable chance occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they
1|regard as the cause of their sufferings. Deprived of power and
1|authority, his crimes and his craft exposed, he should have appeared
1|to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later--an
1|outlawed brigand. But by some strange chance no one perceives this.
1|His part is not yet ended. The man who ten years before and a year
1|later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two
1|days' sail from France, which for some reason is presented to him as
1|his dominion, and guards are given to him and millions of money are
1|paid him.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The
1|waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies
1|are formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have
1|caused the floods to abate.
1|
1|But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The
1|diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this
1|fresh pressure of natural forces; they anticipate war between their
1|sovereigns; the position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they
1|feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises
1|again from the same point as before--Paris. The last backwash of the
1|movement from the west occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the
1|apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military
1|movement of that period of history.
1|
1|The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without
1|any conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but
1|by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man
1|they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.
1|
1|This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.
1|
1|That act is performed.
1|
1|The last role is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off
1|his powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.
1|
1|And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to
1|himself in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues
1|and lies when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to
1|the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as
1|long as an unseen hand directed his actions.
1|
1|The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the
1|actor shows him to us.
1|
1|"See what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was
1|not he but I who moved you?"
1|
1|But dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people
1|understood this.
1|
1|Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of
1|Alexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
1|east to west.
1|
1|What was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head
1|of that movement from east to west?
1|
1|What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with
1|European affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests;
1|a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated
1|with him; a mild and attractive personality; and a personal
1|grievance against Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all
1|this had been prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life:
1|his education, his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded
1|him, and by Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.
1|
1|During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed.
1|But as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented
1|itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the
1|nations of Europe, led them to the goal.
1|
1|The goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses
1|all possible power. How does he use it?
1|
1|Alexander I--the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early
1|years had striven only for his people's welfare, the originator of the
1|liberal innovations in his fatherland--now that he seemed to possess
1|the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing
1|about the welfare of his peoples--at the time when Napoleon in exile
1|was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made
1|mankind happy had he retained power--Alexander I, having fulfilled his
1|mission and feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes
1|the insignificance of that supposed power, turns away from it, and
1|gives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises, saying
1|only:
1|
1|"Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like
1|the rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of
1|God."
1|
1|As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself,
1|and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
1|comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
1|has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.
1|
1|A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is
1|afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet
1|admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it
1|exists to suck the fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee
1|collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it
1|exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper who has studied the life
1|of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed
1|the young bees and rear a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate
1|its race. A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of
1|a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees in this
1|the purpose of the bee's existence. Another, observing the migration
1|of plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may say that
1|in this lies the purpose of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of the
1|bee is not exhausted by the first, the second, or any of the processes
1|the human mind can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in
1|the discovery of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes, that the
1|ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension.
1|
1|All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee
1|to other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of
1|historic characters and nations.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|Natasha's wedding to Bezukhov, which took place in 1813, was the
1|last happy event in the family of the old Rostovs. Count Ilya Rostov
1|died that same year and, as always happens, after the father's death
1|the family group broke up.
1|
1|The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the
1|flight from it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, Petya's
1|death, and the old countess' grief fell blow after blow on the old
1|count's head. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of
1|all these events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if
1|expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed
1|now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and
1|enterprising.
1|
1|The arrangements for Natasha's marriage occupied him for a while. He
1|ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful,
1|but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the
1|contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.
1|
1|When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to
1|complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his
1|bed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again,
1|despite the doctor's encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in
1|an armchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave
1|him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last
1|day, sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for
1|having dissipated their property--that being the chief fault of
1|which he was conscious. After receiving communion and unction he
1|quietly died; and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay
1|their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the
1|Rostovs. All these acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at
1|his house and had so often laughed at him, now said, with a common
1|feeling of self-reproach and emotion, as if justifying themselves:
1|"Well, whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man. You don't
1|meet such men nowadays.... And which of us has not weaknesses of his
1|own?"
1|
1|It was just when the count's affairs had become so involved that
1|it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year
1|that he unexpectedly died.
1|
1|Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his
1|father's death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and
1|without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went
1|to Moscow. The state of the count's affairs became quite obvious a
1|month after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of
1|small debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts
1|amounted to double the value of the property.
1|
1|Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance.
1|But he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father's memory, which
1|he held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and
1|accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the
1|debts.
1|
1|The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague but
1|powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count's
1|careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once.
1|As always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should
1|get paid first, and those who like Mitenka held promissory notes given
1|them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors.
1|Nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed
1|to pity the old man--the cause of their losses (if they were
1|losses)--now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had
1|voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of
1|contracting them.
1|
1|Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold
1|by auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained
1|unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his
1|brother-in-law Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely
1|due for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the
1|remainder, as the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government
1|service.
1|
1|He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel
1|at the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold
1|on life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people
1|who had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil
1|service, he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the
1|uniform of which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and Sonya
1|to a small house on the Sivtsev Vrazhek.
1|
1|Natasha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had
1|no clear idea of Nicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed money from
1|his brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from
1|him. His position was the more difficult because with his salary of
1|twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and
1|Sonya, but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty.
1|The countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious
1|conditions she had been used to from childhood and, unable to
1|realize how hard it was for her son, kept demanding now a carriage
1|(which they did not keep) to send for a friend, now some expensive
1|article of food for herself, or wine for her son, or money to buy a
1|present as a surprise for Natasha or Sonya, or for Nicholas himself.
1|
1|Sonya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her
1|whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their
1|poverty from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably
1|indebted to Sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly
1|admired her patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.
1|
1|He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and
1|because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that
1|people are valued for, but little that could have made him love her.
1|He felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had
1|taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now
1|behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten
1|and could never in any case be renewed.
1|
1|Nicholas' position became worse and worse. The idea of putting
1|something aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he
1|not save anything, but to comply with his mother's demands he even
1|incurred some small debts. He could see no way out of this
1|situation. The idea of marrying some rich woman, which was suggested
1|to him by his female relations, was repugnant to him. The other way
1|out--his mother's death--never entered his head. He wished for nothing
1|and hoped for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy
1|and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his
1|position. He tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their
1|commiseration and offensive offers of assistance; he avoided all
1|distraction and recreation, and even at home did nothing but play
1|cards with his mother, pace silently up and down the room, and smoke
1|one pipe after another. He seemed carefully to cherish within
1|himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his
1|position.

1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From
1|reports current in town she learned how the Rostovs were situated, and
1|how "the son has sacrificed himself for his mother," as people were
1|saying.
1|
1|"I never expected anything else of him," said Princess Mary to
1|herself, feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her
1|friendly relations with all the Rostovs which had made her almost a
1|member of the family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But
1|remembering her relations with Nicholas in Voronezh she was shy
1|about doing so. Making a great effort she did however go to call on
1|them a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow.
1|
1|Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess' room could only
1|be reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure
1|as she had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a
1|cold, stiff, proud expression she had not seen on it before. He
1|inquired about her health, led the way to his mother, and having sat
1|there for five minutes left the room.
1|
1|When the princess came out of the countess' room Nicholas met her
1|again, and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to
1|the anteroom. To her remarks about his mother's health he made no
1|reply. "What's that to you? Leave me in peace," his looks seemed to
1|say.
1|
1|"Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can't bear
1|these ladies and all these civilities!" said he aloud in Sonya's
1|presence, evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the
1|princess' carriage had disappeared.
1|
1|"Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?" cried Sonya, hardly able
1|to conceal her delight. "She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!"
1|
1|Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess
1|any more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several
1|times a day.
1|
1|She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her,
1|expressed a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored
1|when she began to talk about her.
1|
1|Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the
1|princess, but his silence irritated her.
1|
1|"She is a very admirable and excellent young woman," said she,
1|"and you must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing
1|somebody, and I think it must be dull for you only seeing us."
1|
1|"But I don't in the least want to, Mamma."
1|
1|"You used to want to, and now you don't. Really I don't understand
1|you, my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see
1|anyone."
1|
1|"But I never said I was dull."
1|
1|"Why, you said yourself you don't want even to see her. She is a
1|very admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now
1|suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head. You hide
1|everything from me."
1|
1|"Not at all, Mamma."
1|
1|"If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now--but I only
1|ask you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required
1|it.... Well, I have asked you, and now I won't interfere any more
1|since you have secrets from your mother."
1|
1|"Well, then, I'll go if you wish it."
1|
1|"It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for your sake."
1|
1|Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a
1|patience, trying to divert his mother's attention to another topic.
1|
1|The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and
1|the day after that.
1|
1|After her visit to the Rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception
1|by Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been
1|right in not wishing to be the first to call.
1|
1|"I expected nothing else," she told herself, calling her pride to
1|her aid. "I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the
1|old lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many
1|obligations."
1|
1|But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling
1|akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she
1|had firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again and to forget the
1|whole matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position.
1|And when she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit
1|that it was her relation to Rostov. His cold, polite manner did not
1|express his feeling for her (she knew that) but it concealed
1|something, and until she could discover what that something was, she
1|felt that she could not be at ease.
1|
1|One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
1|nephew's lessons, she was informed that Rostov had called. With a firm
1|resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she
1|sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.
1|
1|Her first glance at Nicholas' face told her that he had only come to
1|fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain
1|the tone in which he addressed her.
1|
1|They spoke of the countess' health, of their mutual friends, of
1|the latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety
1|had elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say
1|good-by.
1|
1|With Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the princess had maintained the
1|conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he
1|rose, she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and
1|her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so
1|little happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat
1|still, her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing
1|that he had risen.
1|
1|Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her
1|abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again
1|looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of
1|suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was
1|vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
1|expressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could
1|think of nothing to say.
1|
1|"Good-by, Princess!" said he.
1|
1|She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.
1|
1|"Oh, I beg your pardon," she said as if waking up. "Are you going
1|already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the
1|countess!"
1|
1|"Wait a moment, I'll fetch it," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she
1|left the room.
1|
1|They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.
1|
1|"Yes, Princess," said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, "it doesn't
1|seem long ago since we first met at Bogucharovo, but how much water
1|has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then,
1|yet I would give much to bring back that time... but there's no
1|bringing it back."
1|
1|Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous
1|ones as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden
1|meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her.
1|
1|"Yes, yes," said she, "but you have no reason to regret the past,
1|Count. As I understand your present life, I think you will always
1|recall it with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills
1|it now..."
1|
1|"I cannot accept your praise," he interrupted her hurriedly. "On the
1|contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an
1|interesting or cheerful subject."
1|
1|His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the
1|princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved,
1|and it was to him that she now spoke.
1|
1|"I thought you would allow me to tell you this," she said. "I had
1|come so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would
1|not consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken," and
1|suddenly her voice trembled. "I don't know why," she continued,
1|recovering herself, "but you used to be different, and..."
1|
1|"There are a thousand reasons why," laying special emphasis on the
1|why. "Thank you, Princess," he added softly. "Sometimes it is hard."
1|
1|"So that's why! That's why!" a voice whispered in Princess Mary's
1|soul. "No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only
1|that handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble,
1|resolute, self-sacrificing spirit too," she said to herself. "Yes,
1|he is poor now and I am rich.... Yes, that's the only reason....
1|Yes, were it not for that..." And remembering his former tenderness,
1|and looking now at his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood
1|the cause of his coldness.
1|
1|"But why, Count, why?" she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer
1|to him. "Why? Tell me. You must tell me!"
1|
1|He was silent.
1|
1|"I don't understand your why, Count," she continued, "but it's
1|hard for me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of
1|our former friendship. And that hurts me." There were tears in her
1|eyes and in her voice. "I have had so little happiness in life that
1|every loss is hard for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!" and
1|suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room.
1|
1|"Princess, for God's sake!" he exclaimed, trying to stop her.
1|"Princess!"
1|
1|She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one
1|another's eyes--and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly
1|became possible, inevitable, and very near.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to
1|Bald Hills with his wife, his mother, and Sonya.
1|
1|Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
1|selling any of his wife's property, and having received a small
1|inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as
1|well.
1|
1|In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs
1|that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was
1|negotiating to buy back Otradnoe--that being his pet dream.
1|
1|Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it
1|that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas
1|was a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the
1|English ones then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical
1|treatises on estate management, disliked factories, the raising of
1|expensive products, and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not
1|make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate. He
1|always had before his mind's eye the estate as a whole and not any
1|particular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes was not the
1|nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor manures, nor
1|special plows, but that most important agent by which nitrogen,
1|oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective--the peasant laborer.
1|When Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its
1|different branches, it was the serf who especially attracted his
1|attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely a tool, but also a
1|judge of farming and an end in himself. At first he watched the serfs,
1|trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad,
1|and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality
1|learning from them their methods, their manner of speech, and their
1|judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he had understood the
1|peasants' tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk their
1|language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt akin to
1|them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to perform
1|toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas' management
1|produced very brilliant results.
1|
1|Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the
1|estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and
1|delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they
1|had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before
1|analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and
1|credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle
1|the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He
1|kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not
1|allowing the family groups to divide into separate households. He
1|was hard alike on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to
1|get them expelled from the commune.
1|
1|He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' hay and
1|corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and
1|harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did
1|Nicholas.
1|
1|He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs--the
1|"drones" as he called them--and everyone said he spoiled them by his
1|laxity. When a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf,
1|especially if one had to be punished, he always felt undecided and
1|consulted everybody in the house; but when it was possible to have a
1|domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without
1|the least hesitation. He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the
1|peasants. He knew that his every decision would be approved by them
1|all with very few exceptions.
1|
1|He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to
1|make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined
1|to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he
1|should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and
1|definite in his own mind.
1|
1|Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he
1|would say: "What can one do with our Russian peasants?" and imagined
1|that he could not bear them.
1|
1|Yet he loved "our Russian peasants" and their way of life with his
1|whole soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated
1|the one way and manner of farming which produced good results.
1|
1|Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband's and
1|regretted that she could not share it; but she could not understand
1|the joys and vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote
1|and alien. She could not understand why he was so particularly
1|animated and happy when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the
1|whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor, he returned
1|from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her. She did not
1|understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the
1|farming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant Matthew Ermishin, who
1|with his family had carted corn all night; or of the fact that his
1|(Nicholas') sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his
1|harvest in. She did not understand why he stepped out from the
1|window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so
1|joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty
1|shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind carried away a
1|threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the
1|barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and
1|gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would say:
1|"Well, one more day and my grain and the peasants' will all be under
1|cover."
1|
1|Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready
1|to anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she
1|brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed
1|to her to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should
1|obstinately refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what
1|was not her business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved
1|passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed.
1|
1|Sometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work
1|he was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: "Not in the
1|least; it never entered my head and I wouldn't do that for their good!
1|That's all poetry and old wives' talk--all that doing good to one's
1|neighbor! What I want is that our children should not have to go
1|begging. I must put our affairs in order while I am alive, that's all.
1|And to do that, order and strictness are essential.... That's all
1|about it!" said he, clenching his vigorous fist. "And fairness, of
1|course," he added, "for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has
1|only one miserable horse, he can do no good either for himself or
1|for me."
1|
1|And all Nicholas did was fruitful--probably just because he
1|refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for
1|virtue's sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring
1|estates came to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the
1|memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs.
1|"He was a master... the peasants' affairs first and then his own. Of
1|course he was not to be trifled with either--in a word, he was a
1|real master!"
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas,
1|and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of
1|making free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in
1|this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form
1|of punishment suddenly changed.
1|
1|Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, a
1|man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused
1|of dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the
1|porch to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few
1|replies the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch
1|Nicholas went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over
1|her embroidery frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had
1|been doing that morning. Among other things he spoke of the
1|Bogucharovo elder. Countess Mary turned red and then pale, but
1|continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her
1|husband no reply.
1|
1|"Such an insolent scoundrel!" he cried, growing hot again at the
1|mere recollection of him. "If he had told me he was drunk and did
1|not see... But what is the matter with you, Mary?" he suddenly asked.
1|
1|Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked
1|down again and her lips puckered.
1|
1|"Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?"
1|
1|The looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in
1|tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow
1|or pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible
1|charm.
1|
1|The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain
1|herself and began to cry.
1|
1|"Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!"
1|and she covered her face with her hands.
1|
1|Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and
1|paced up and down the room. He understood what she was weeping
1|about, but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what
1|he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong.
1|"Is it just sentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she right?" he
1|asked himself. Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her
1|face filled with love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she
1|was right and that he had long been sinning against himself.
1|
1|"Mary," he said softly, going up to her, "it will never happen
1|again; I give you my word. Never," he repeated in a trembling voice
1|like a boy asking for forgiveness.
1|
1|The tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes. She took
1|his hand and kissed it.
1|
1|"Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?" she asked to change the
1|subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo
1|of Laocoon's head.
1|
1|"Today--it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don't remind me of it!"
1|and again he flushed. "I give you my word of honor it shan't occur
1|again, and let this always be a reminder to me," and he pointed to the
1|broken ring.
1|
1|After that, when in discussions with his village elders or
1|stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench,
1|Nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his
1|eyes before the man who was making him angry. But he did forget
1|himself once or twice within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and
1|confess to his wife, and would again promise that this should really
1|be the very last time.
1|
1|"Mary, you must despise me!" he would say. "I deserve it."
1|
1|"You should go, go away at once, if you don't feel strong enough
1|to control yourself," she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her
1|husband.
1|
1|Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not
1|liked. He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class,
1|and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid.
1|The whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with
1|the work on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the
1|same business like seriousness--leaving home for a month, or even two,
1|with his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his
1|time reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on
1|these he spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he
1|said, a serious library, and he made it a rule to read through all the
1|books he bought. He would sit in his study with a grave air,
1|reading--a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty, but which
1|afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and
1|a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters. In winter,
1|except for business excursions, he spent most of his time at home
1|making himself one with his family and entering into all the details
1|of his children's relations with their mother. The harmony between him
1|and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh
1|spiritual treasures in her.
1|
1|From the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house. Before
1|that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself
1|and Sonya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess
1|Mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized
1|the wrong he had done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward her, and
1|imagined that her wealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. She could
1|not find fault with Sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her,
1|but often felt ill-will toward her which she could not overcome.
1|
1|Once she had a talk with her friend Natasha about Sonya and about
1|her own injustice toward her.
1|
1|"You know," said Natasha, "you have read the Gospels a great
1|deal--there is a passage in them that just fits Sonya."
1|
1|"What?" asked Countess Mary, surprised.
1|
1|"'To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not
1|shall be taken away.' You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I
1|don't know. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don't know, but from her is
1|taken away, and everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am
1|dreadfully sorry for her. Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to
1|marry her, but I always had a sort of presentiment that it would not
1|come off. She is a sterile flower, you know--like some strawberry
1|blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for her, and sometimes I think she
1|doesn't feel it as you or I would."
1|
1|Though Countess Mary told Natasha that those words in the Gospel
1|must be understood differently, yet looking at Sonya she agreed with
1|Natasha's explanation. It really seemed that Sonya did not feel her
1|position trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a
1|sterile flower. She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of
1|the family as a whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the
1|people but to the home. She waited on the old countess, petted and
1|spoiled the children, was always ready to render the small services
1|for which she had a gift, and all this was unconsciously accepted from
1|her with insufficient gratitude.
1|
1|The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the
1|same scale as under the old prince.
1|
1|The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more
1|than simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of
1|wood, plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished
1|with very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by
1|their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was
1|spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for
1|visitors. Whole families of the Rostovs' and Bolkonskis' relations
1|sometimes came to Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of
1|servants and stayed for months. Besides that, four times a year, on
1|the name days and birthdays of the hosts, as many as a hundred
1|visitors would gather there for a day or two. The rest of the year
1|life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations, and
1|its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided out of the
1|produce of the estate.

1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Natasha
1|had been staying at her brother's with her husband and children
1|since early autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his
1|own for three weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven
1|weeks and was expected back every minute.
1|
1|Besides the Bezukhov family, Nicholas' old friend the retired
1|General Vasili Dmitrich Denisov was staying with the Rostovs this
1|fifth of December.
1|
1|On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of
1|visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for
1|a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to
1|the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would
1|come to congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about
1|the elections of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to
1|spend the eve of that day in his usual way. He examined the
1|bailiff's accounts of the village in Ryazan which belonged to his
1|wife's nephew, wrote two business letters, and walked over to the
1|granaries, cattle yards and stables before dinner. Having taken
1|precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the
1|morrow because it was a great saint's day, he returned to dinner,
1|and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at
1|the long table laid for twenty persons, at which the whole household
1|had assembled. At that table were his mother, his mother's old lady
1|companion Belova, his wife, their three children with their
1|governess and tutor, his wife's nephew with his tutor, Sonya, Denisov,
1|Natasha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael
1|Ivanovich, the late prince's architect, who was living on in
1|retirement at Bald Hills.
1|
1|Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband
1|took his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after
1|taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass
1|standing before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the
1|case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm--especially
1|before the soup. Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when
1|she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had
1|his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there
1|was no cause for his ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and
1|was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason, and
1|she felt unhappy. She asked him where he had been. He replied. She
1|again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm. Her
1|unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily.
1|
1|"Then I'm not mistaken," thought Countess Mary. "Why is he cross
1|with me?" She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and
1|wished to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded
1|unnatural, but could not refrain from asking some more questions.
1|
1|Thanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became general
1|and lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the
1|table and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary
1|held out her hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was
1|angry with her.
1|
1|"You always have such strange fancies! I didn't even think of
1|being angry," he replied.
1|
1|But the word always seemed to her to imply: "Yes, I am angry but I
1|won't tell you why."
1|
1|Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sonya
1|and the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to
1|disagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they
1|had their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always
1|just after they had been happiest together, they suddenly had a
1|feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most
1|frequently during Countess Mary's pregnancies, and this was such a
1|time.
1|
1|"Well, messieurs et mesdames," said Nicholas loudly and with
1|apparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on
1|purpose to vex her), "I have been on my feet since six this morning.
1|Tomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today I'll go and rest."
1|
1|And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room
1|and lay down on the sofa.
1|
1|"That's always the way," thought Countess Mary. "He talks to
1|everyone except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him,
1|especially when I am in this condition." She looked down at her
1|expanded figure and in the glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face
1|in which her eyes now looked larger than ever.
1|
1|And everything annoyed her--Denisov's shouting and laughter,
1|Natasha's talk, and especially a quick glance Sonya gave her.
1|
1|Sonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling
1|irritated.
1|
1|Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything
1|of what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the
1|nursery.
1|
1|The children were playing at "going to Moscow" in a carriage made of
1|chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with
1|them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
1|crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with
1|difficulty, went to the small sitting room.
1|
1|"Perhaps he is not asleep; I'll have an explanation with him," she
1|said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his
1|mother, followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.
1|
1|"Mary, dear, I think he is asleep--he was so tired," said Sonya,
1|meeting her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that
1|she crossed her path everywhere). "Andrew may wake him."
1|
1|Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt
1|that Sonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with
1|evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made
1|no reply, but to avoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew to follow
1|her quietly and went to the door. Sonya went away by another door.
1|From the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his
1|even breathing, every slightest tone of which was familiar to his
1|wife. As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome
1|forehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so often seen
1|it in the stillness of the night when he slept. Nicholas suddenly
1|moved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted
1|from outside the door: "Papa! Mamma's standing here!" Countess Mary
1|turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and
1|quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how
1|Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard
1|Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice said
1|crossly:
1|
1|"I can't get a moment's peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you
1|bring him here?"
1|
1|"I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me..."
1|
1|Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the
1|door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little
1|black-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father's pet, having learned
1|from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting
1|room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little
1|girl boldly opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with
1|energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, and having examined the
1|position of her father, who was asleep with his back to her, rose on
1|tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head. Nicholas turned
1|with a tender smile on his face.
1|
1|"Natasha, Natasha!" came Countess Mary's frightened whisper from the
1|door. "Papa wants to sleep."
1|
1|"No, Mamma, he doesn't want to sleep," said little Natasha with
1|conviction. "He's laughing."
1|
1|Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.
1|
1|"Come in, Mary," he said to his wife.
1|
1|She went in and sat down by her husband.
1|
1|"I did not notice him following me," she said timidly. "I just
1|looked in."
1|
1|Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife
1|and, seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and
1|kissed her hair.
1|
1|"May I kiss Mamma?" he asked Natasha.
1|
1|Natasha smiled bashfully.
1|
1|"Again!" she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the
1|spot where Nicholas had placed the kiss.
1|
1|"I don't know why you think I am cross," said Nicholas, replying
1|to the question he knew was in his wife's mind.
1|
1|"You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are
1|like that. It always seems to me..."
1|
1|"Mary, don't talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" he
1|said gaily.
1|
1|"It seems to be that you can't love me, that I am so plain...
1|always... and now... in this cond..."
1|
1|"Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it's love
1|that makes us see beauty. It is only Malvinas and women of that kind
1|who are loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don't love
1|her, but... I don't know how to put it. Without you, or when something
1|comes between us like this, I seem lost and can't do anything. Now
1|do I love my finger? I don't love it, but just try to cut it off!"
1|
1|"I'm not like that myself, but I understand. So you're not angry
1|with me?"
1|
1|"Awfully angry!" he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing
1|his hair he began to pace the room.
1|
1|"Do you know, Mary, what I've been thinking?" he began,
1|immediately thinking aloud in his wife's presence now that they had
1|made it up.
1|
1|He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A
1|thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he
1|told her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till
1|spring.
1|
1|Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and
1|in her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the
1|children.
1|
1|"You can see the woman in her already," she said in French, pointing
1|to little Natasha. "You reproach us women with being illogical. Here
1|is our logic. I say: 'Papa wants to sleep!' but she says, 'No, he's
1|laughing.' And she was right," said Countess Mary with a happy smile.
1|
1|"Yes, yes." And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong
1|hand, lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the
1|legs, and paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree
1|happiness on the faces of both father and daughter.
1|
1|"But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,"
1|his wife whispered in French.
1|
1|"Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show..."
1|
1|At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps
1|in the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.
1|
1|"Somebody has come."
1|
1|"I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see," said Countess Mary
1|and left the room.
1|
1|In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little
1|daughter a gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the
1|laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart.
1|His capers reminded him of dancing, and looking at the child's round
1|happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was
1|an old man, taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her
1|as his old father had danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.
1|
1|"It is he, it is he, Nicholas!" said Countess Mary, re-entering
1|the room a few minutes later. "Now our Natasha has come to life. You
1|should have seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed
1|away so long. Well, come along now, quick, quick! It's time you two
1|were parted," she added, looking smilingly at the little girl who
1|clung to her father.
1|
1|Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.
1|
1|Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.
1|
1|"I should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,"
1|she whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time
1|she sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though
1|she felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of
1|happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily
1|thought at that instant.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Natasha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already
1|had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she
1|was now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was
1|difficult to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively
1|Natasha of former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm,
1|soft, and serene expression. In her face there was none of the
1|ever-glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted
1|its charm. Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her
1|soul was not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong,
1|handsome, and fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her
1|face now. That happened only when, as was the case that day, her
1|husband returned home, or a sick child was convalescent, or when she
1|and Countess Mary spoke of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to
1|her husband, who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew's memory),
1|or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to
1|sing, a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage. At the
1|rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully
1|developed body she was even more attractive than in former days.
1|
1|Since their marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in
1|Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is
1|to say, in Nicholas' house. The young Countess Bezukhova was not often
1|seen in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her
1|and found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked
1|solitude--she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even
1|thought that she did not--but with her pregnancies, her
1|confinements, the nursing of her children, and sharing every moment of
1|her husband's life, she had demands on her time which could be
1|satisfied only by renouncing society. All who had known Natasha before
1|her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something
1|extraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had
1|realized that all Natasha's outbursts had been due to her need of
1|children and a husband--as she herself had once exclaimed at
1|Otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest--and her mother was now
1|surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never
1|understood Natasha, and she kept saying that she had always known that
1|Natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother.
1|
1|"Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
1|bounds," said the countess, "so that it even becomes absurd."
1|
1|Natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,
1|especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let
1|herself go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments,
1|should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was
1|unmarried, and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before
1|he became her husband. Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned
1|all her witchery, of which her singing had been an unusually powerful
1|part. She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive. She
1|took no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her
1|toilet, or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming
1|attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She
1|acted in contradiction to all those rules. She felt that the
1|allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be
1|merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, to whom she had from the
1|first moment given herself up entirely--that is, with her whole soul,
1|leaving no corner of it hidden from him. She felt that her unity with
1|her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had
1|attracted him to her, but by something else--indefinite but firm as
1|the bond between her own body and soul.
1|
1|To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing
1|romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange
1|as to adorn herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others
1|might perhaps have been agreeable--she did not know--but she had no
1|time at all for it. The chief reason for devoting no time either to
1|singing, to dress, or to choosing her words was that she really had no
1|time to spare for these things.
1|
1|We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed
1|in a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject
1|so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's
1|entire attention is devoted to it.
1|
1|The subject which wholly engrossed Natasha's attention was her
1|family: that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should
1|belong entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she
1|had to bear, bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.
1|
1|And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her
1|whole soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the
1|larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did
1|her powers appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one
1|thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered
1|necessary.
1|
1|There were then as now conversations and discussions about women's
1|rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and
1|rights, though these themes were not yet termed questions as they
1|are now; but these topics were not merely uninteresting to Natasha,
1|she positively did not understand them.
1|
1|These questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing
1|in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that
1|is, only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance,
1|which lies in the family.
1|
1|Discussions and questions of that kind, which are like the
1|question of how to get the greatest gratification from one's dinner,
1|did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of
1|a dinner is the nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is
1|the family.
1|
1|If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats
1|two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain
1|his purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.
1|
1|If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to
1|have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in
1|that case will not have a family.
1|
1|If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is
1|the family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more
1|than one can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are
1|needed for the family--that is, one wife or one husband. Natasha
1|needed a husband. A husband was given her and he gave her a family.
1|And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband, but as
1|all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and
1|family, she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how
1|it would be if things were different.
1|
1|Natasha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the
1|society of her relatives--Countess Mary, and her brother, her
1|mother, and Sonya. She valued the company of those to whom she could
1|come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and
1|with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby's
1|napkin, and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect
1|that baby was much better.
1|
1|To such an extent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed
1|and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy--she was
1|jealous of Sonya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or
1|plain--were habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general
1|opinion was that Pierre was under his wife's thumb, which was really
1|true. From the very first days of their married life Natasha had
1|announced her demands. Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife's
1|view, to him a perfectly novel one, that every moment of his life
1|belonged to her and to the family. His wife's demands astonished him,
1|but they also flattered him, and he submitted to them.
1|
1|Pierre's subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
1|flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman;
1|did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money
1|on a whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time,
1|except on business--in which his wife included his intellectual
1|pursuits, which she did not in the least understand but to which she
1|attributed great importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had
1|the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as
1|he chose. At home Natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to
1|her husband, and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was
1|occupied--that is, was reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but
1|to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done
1|always. He had only to express a wish and Natasha would jump up and
1|run to fulfill it.
1|
1|The entire household was governed according to Pierre's supposed
1|orders, that is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their way
1|of life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties,
1|Natasha's occupations, the children's upbringing, were all selected
1|not merely with regard to Pierre's expressed wishes, but to what
1|Natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his
1|wishes to be. And she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite
1|correctly, and having once arrived at them clung to them
1|tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would
1|fight him with his own weapons.
1|
1|Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of
1|their first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet
1|nurse three times and Natasha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day
1|told her of Rousseau's view, with which he quite agreed, that to have
1|a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born,
1|despite the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her
1|husband himself--who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her
1|baby herself, a thing then unheard of and considered injurious--she
1|insisted on having her own way, and after that nursed all her babies
1|herself.
1|
1|It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and
1|wife would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his
1|surprise and delight would find in his wife's ideas and actions the
1|very thought against which she had argued, but divested of
1|everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had
1|added when expressing his opinion.
1|
1|After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm
1|consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he
1|saw himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within
1|himself inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really
1|good in him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was
1|rejected. And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a
1|direct and mysterious reflection.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the
1|Rostovs he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to
1|come to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were
1|being discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the
1|principal founders.
1|
1|On reading that letter (she always read her husband's letters)
1|Natasha herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though
1|she would feel his absence very acutely. She attributed immense
1|importance to all her husband's intellectual and abstract interests
1|though she did not understand them, and she always dreaded being a
1|hindrance to him in such matters. To Pierre's timid look of inquiry
1|after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go, but to fix a
1|definite date for his return. He was given four weeks' leave of
1|absence.
1|
1|Ever since that leave of absence had expired, more than a
1|fortnight before, Natasha had been in a constant state of alarm,
1|depression, and irritability.
1|
1|Denisov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied
1|with the present state of affairs, had arrived during that
1|fortnight. He looked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad
1|likeness of a person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies,
1|and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former
1|enchantress.
1|
1|Natasha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her
1|mother, her brother, Sonya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to
1|console her tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay
1|in returning.
1|
1|"It's all nonsense, all rubbish--those discussions which lead to
1|nothing and all those idiotic societies!" Natasha declared of the very
1|affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.
1|
1|And she would go to the nursery to nurse Petya, her only boy. No one
1|else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
1|little three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she
1|was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his
1|little nose. That creature said: "You are angry, you are jealous,
1|you would like to pay him out, you are afraid--but here am I! And I am
1|he..." and that was unanswerable. It was more than true.
1|
1|During that fortnight of anxiety Natasha resorted to the baby for
1|comfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him
1|and he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was
1|just what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety
1|about her husband more easily.
1|
1|She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre's sleigh was
1|heard at the front door, and the old nurse--knowing how to please
1|her mistress--entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a
1|beaming face.
1|
1|"Has he come?" Natasha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move
1|lest she should rouse the dozing baby.
1|
1|"He's come, ma'am," whispered the nurse.
1|
1|The blood rushed to Natasha's face and her feet involuntarily moved,
1|but she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his
1|eyes and looked at her. "You're here?" he seemed to be saying, and
1|again lazily smacked his lips.
1|
1|Cautiously withdrawing her breast, Natasha rocked him a little,
1|handed him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door.
1|But at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for
1|having in her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round.
1|The nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of
1|his cot.
1|
1|"Go, ma'am! Don't worry, go!" she whispered, smiling, with the
1|kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.
1|
1|Natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.
1|
1|Denisov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with
1|his pipe, now for the first time recognized the old Natasha. A flood
1|of brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.
1|
1|"He's come!" she exclaimed as she ran past, and Denisov felt that he
1|too was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had
1|returned.
1|
1|On reaching the vestibule Natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
1|unwinding his scarf. "It's he! It's really he! He has come!" she
1|said to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head
1|to her breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy,
1|happy face, covered with hoarfrost. "Yes, it is he, happy and
1|contented..."
1|
1|Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
1|experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her
1|face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of
1|reproaches and angry words.
1|
1|"Yes, it's all very well for you. You are pleased, you've had a good
1|time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown
1|consideration for the children. I am nursing and my milk was
1|spoiled.... Petya was at death's door. But you were enjoying yourself.
1|Yes, enjoying..."
1|
1|Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come
1|sooner; he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a
1|minute or two; above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy.
1|He wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a
1|piteous, frightened face and bent down.
1|
1|"I could not, on my honor. But how is Petya?"
1|
1|"All right now. Come along! I wonder you're not ashamed! If only you
1|could see what I was like without you, how I suffered!"
1|
1|"You are well?"
1|
1|"Come, come!" she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went
1|to their rooms.
1|
1|When Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the
1|nursery holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right
1|palm and dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby's
1|broad face with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since
1|over and there was bright, joyous sunshine on Natasha's face as she
1|gazed tenderly at her husband and child.
1|
1|"And have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?" she
1|asked.
1|
1|"Yes, capitally."
1|
1|"You see, he holds it up." (She meant the baby's head.) "But how
1|he did frighten me... You've seen the princess? Is it true she's in
1|love with that..."
1|
1|"Yes, just fancy..."
1|
1|At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the
1|baby on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries.
1|But in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the
1|baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all
1|his attention.
1|
1|"How sweet!" said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the
1|baby. "Now, Nicholas," she added, turning to her husband, "I can't
1|understand how it is you don't see the charm of these delicious
1|marvels."
1|
1|"I don't and can't," replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby.
1|"A lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!"
1|
1|"And yet he's such an affectionate father," said Countess Mary,
1|vindicating her husband, "but only after they are a year old or so..."
1|
1|"Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly," said Natasha. "He says his
1|hand is just made for a baby's seat. Just look!"
1|
1|"Only not for this..." Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and
1|shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several
1|perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole,
1|though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the
1|others. Every event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house
1|was important to all these worlds, but each had its own special
1|reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the
1|others.
1|
1|For instance, Pierre's return was a joyful and important event and
1|they all felt it to be so.
1|
1|The servants--the most reliable judges of their masters because they
1|judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
1|acts and way of life--were glad of Pierre's return because they knew
1|that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day
1|to attend to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper,
1|and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the
1|holidays.
1|
1|The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre's return
1|because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as
1|he did. He alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise (his only
1|piece) to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced,
1|and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all.
1|
1|Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,
1|with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted
1|because Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his
1|rapturous and passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this
1|love for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had
1|brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she
1|loved him, and little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him
1|with just a shade of contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did
1|not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle
1|Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In
1|Pierre's presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed
1|and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a
1|single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by
1|himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had
1|said. Pierre's past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which
1|young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he
1|had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Platon
1|Karataev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Natasha
1|(of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially
1|Pierre's friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not
1|remember--all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.
1|
1|From broken remarks about Natasha and his father, from the emotion
1|with which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful,
1|reverent tenderness with which Natasha spoke of him, the boy, who
1|was only just beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that
1|his father had loved Natasha and when dying had left her to his
1|friend. But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a
1|divinity who could not be pictured, and of whom he never thought
1|without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture. So the
1|boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived.
1|
1|The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and
1|unite any company he was in.
1|
1|The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were
1|pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more
1|smoothly and peacefully.
1|
1|The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and
1|especially that Natasha would now be herself again.
1|
1|Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and
1|made haste to satisfy all their expectations.
1|
1|Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the
1|aid of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not
1|forgetting his mother--and brother-in-law's commissions, nor the dress
1|material for a present to Belova, nor toys for his wife's nephews.
1|In the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that
1|his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things
1|he undertook to buy, and he had been taken aback by her serious
1|annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything. But in time
1|he grew used to this demand. Knowing that Natasha asked nothing for
1|herself, and gave him commissions for others only when he himself
1|had offered to undertake them, he now found an unexpected and
1|childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the
1|house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred Natasha's censure
1|it was only for buying too many and too expensive things. To her other
1|defects (as most people thought them, but which to Pierre were
1|qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now added
1|stinginess.
1|
1|From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing
1|entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he
1|spent only half as much as before, and that his affairs--which had
1|been in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife's
1|debts--had begun to improve.
1|
1|Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive
1|luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no
1|longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had
1|now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not
1|in his power, and so that way of life proved economical.
1|
1|With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.
1|
1|"What do you think of this?" said he, unrolling a piece of stuff
1|like a shopman.
1|
1|Natasha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on
1|her lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the
1|things he showed her.
1|
1|"That's for Belova? Excellent!" She felt the quality of the
1|material. "It was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?"
1|
1|Pierre told her the price.
1|
1|"Too dear!" Natasha remarked. "How pleased the children will be
1|and Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this," she added,
1|unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb
1|set with pearls, of a kind then just coming into fashion.
1|
1|"Adele tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it," returned
1|Pierre.
1|
1|"When am I to wear it?" and Natasha stuck it in her coil of hair.
1|"When I take little Masha into society? Perhaps they will be
1|fashionable again by then. Well, let's go now."
1|
1|And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and
1|then to the old countess' rooms.
1|
1|The countess was sitting with her companion Belova, playing
1|grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Natasha came into the drawing
1|room with parcels under their arms.
1|
1|The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with
1|a frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper
1|lip had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.
1|
1|After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession,
1|she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
1|without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or
1|kept awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She
1|wanted nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity
1|only death could give her. But until death came she had to go on
1|living, that is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in
1|very young children and very old people was particularly evident in
1|her. Her life had no external aims--only a need to exercise her
1|various functions and inclinations was apparent. She had to eat,
1|sleep, think, speak, weep, work, give vent to her anger, and so on,
1|merely because she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a
1|liver. She did these things not under any external impulse as people
1|in the full vigor of life do, when behind the purpose for which they
1|strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed. She
1|talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and
1|lungs. She cried as a child does, because her nose had to be
1|cleared, and so on. What for people in their full vigor is an aim
1|was for her evidently merely a pretext.
1|
1|Thus in the morning--especially if she had eaten anything rich the
1|day before--she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the
1|handiest pretext Belova's deafness.
1|
1|She would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other
1|end of the room.
1|
1|"It seems a little warmer today, my dear," she would murmur.
1|
1|And when Belova replied: "Oh yes, they've come," she would mutter
1|angrily: "O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!"
1|
1|Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or
1|too damp or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability
1|her face would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible
1|symptoms when Belova would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the
1|countess' face yellow. Just as she needed to work off her spleen so
1|she had sometimes to exercise her still-existing faculty of
1|thinking--and the pretext for that was a game of patience. When she
1|needed to cry, the deceased count would be the pretext. When she
1|wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health would be the pretext,
1|and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the pretext would be
1|Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise, which was
1|usually toward seven o'clock when she had had an after-dinner rest
1|in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same
1|stories over and over again to the same audience.
1|
1|The old lady's condition was understood by the whole household
1|though no one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible
1|effort to satisfy her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a
1|sad smile between Nicholas, Pierre, Natasha, and Countess Mary was the
1|common understanding of her condition expressed.
1|
1|But those glances expressed something more: they said that she had
1|played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole
1|self, that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to
1|yield to her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being
1|formerly as full of life as themselves, but now so much to be
1|pitied. "Memento mori," said these glances.
1|
1|Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and
1|the little children failed to understand this and avoided her.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIII
1|
1|
1|When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was
1|in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion
1|of playing patience, and so--though by force of habit she greeted
1|him with the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned
1|after an absence: "High time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of
1|waiting for you. Well, thank God!" and received her presents with
1|another customary remark: "It's not the gift that's precious, my dear,
1|but that you give it to me, an old woman..."--yet it was evident
1|that she was not pleased by Pierre's arrival at that moment when it
1|diverted her attention from the unfinished game.
1|
1|She finished her game of patience and only then examined the
1|presents. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid
1|workmanship, a bright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses
1|depicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count's
1|portrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in
1|Petersburg. The countess had long wished for such a box, but as she
1|did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the
1|portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards.
1|
1|"Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up," said she as she always
1|did. "But best of all you have brought yourself back--for I never
1|saw anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are
1|we to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away.
1|Doesn't see anything, doesn't remember anything," she went on,
1|repeating her usual phrases. "Look, Anna Timofeevna," she added to her
1|companion, "see what a box for cards my son has brought us!"
1|
1|Belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress
1|material.
1|
1|Though Pierre, Natasha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denisov had
1|much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old
1|countess--not that anything was hidden from her, but because she had
1|dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to
1|converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune
1|questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times:
1|that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married, which she would
1|again be unable to remember--yet they sat at tea round the samovar
1|in the drawing room from habit, and Pierre answered the countess'
1|questions as to whether Prince Vasili had aged and whether Countess
1|Mary Alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them, and other
1|matters that interested no one and to which she herself was
1|indifferent.
1|
1|Conversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,
1|continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the
1|family were assembled near the round tea table at which Sonya presided
1|beside the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had
1|had tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all
1|sat in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small
1|table where his tea was handed to him; Milka, the old gray borzoi
1|bitch (daughter of the first Milka), with a quite gray face and
1|large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the
1|armchair beside him; Denisov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers
1|had turned half gray, sat beside countess Mary with his general's
1|tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He
1|spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could
1|understand. He told her of external social events and of the people
1|who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a
1|real, living, and distinct group, but who were now for the most part
1|scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last
1|ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years. But to the old
1|countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious
1|and real society. Natasha saw by Pierre's animation that his visit had
1|been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it
1|before the old countess. Denisov, not being a member of the family,
1|did not understand Pierre's caution and being, as a malcontent, much
1|interested in what was occurring in Petersburg, kept urging Pierre
1|to tell them about what had happened in the Semenovsk regiment, then
1|about Arakcheev, and then about the Bible Society. Once or twice
1|Pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things, but
1|Nicholas and Natasha always brought him back to the health of Prince
1|Ivan and Countess Mary Alexeevna.
1|
1|"Well, and all this idiocy--Gossner and Tatawinova?" Denisov
1|asked. "Is that weally still going on?"
1|
1|"Going on?" Pierre exclaimed. "Why more than ever! The Bible Society
1|is the whole government now!"
1|
1| "What is that, mon cher ami?" asked the countess, who had
1|finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry
1|after her meal. "What are you saying about the government? I don't
1|understand."
1|
1|"Well, you know, Maman," Nicholas interposed, knowing how to
1|translate things into his mother's language, "Prince Alexander
1|Golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence,
1|they say."
1|
1|"Arakcheev and Golitsyn," incautiously remarked Pierre, "are now the
1|whole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere
1|and are afraid of everything."
1|
1|"Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most
1|estimable man. I used to meet him at Mary Antonovna's," said the
1|countess in an offended tone; and still more offended that they all
1|remained silent, she went on: "Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel
1|Society! Well, and what harm is there in that?" and she rose
1|(everybody else got up too) and with a severe expression sailed back
1|to her table in the sitting room.
1|
1|The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
1|children's voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some
1|jolly excitement was going on there.
1|
1|"Finished, finished!" little Natasha's gleeful yell rose above
1|them all.
1|
1|Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natasha he
1|never lost sight of) and smiled happily.
1|
1|"That's delightful music!" said he.
1|
1|"It means that Anna Makarovna has finished her stocking," said
1|Countess Mary.
1|
1|"Oh, I'll go and see," said Pierre, jumping up. "You know," he
1|added, stopping at the door, "why I'm especially fond of that music?
1|It is always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was
1|driving here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I
1|grew. As I entered the anteroom I heard Andrusha's peals of laughter
1|and that meant that all was well."
1|
1|"I know! I know that feeling," said Nicholas. "But I mustn't go
1|there--those stockings are to be a surprise for me."
1|
1|Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew
1|still louder.
1|
1|"Come, Anna Makarovna," Pierre's voice was heard saying, "come here
1|into the middle of the room and at the word of command, 'One, two,'
1|and when I say 'three'... You stand here, and you in my arms--well
1|now! One, two!..." said Pierre, and a silence followed: "three!" and a
1|rapturously breathless cry of children's voices filled the room. "Two,
1|two!" they shouted.
1|
1|This meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to
1|herself Anna Makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same
1|needles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly
1|drew, one out of the other, in the children's presence.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XIV
1|
1|
1|Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They
1|kissed everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and
1|they went out. Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles
1|whispered to the boy to come downstairs.
1|
1|"No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay," replied
1|Nicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper.
1|
1|"Ma tante, please let me stay," said he, going up to his aunt.
1|
1|His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary
1|glanced at him and turned to Pierre.
1|
1|"When you are here he can't tear himself away," she said.
1|
1|"I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good
1|night!" said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned
1|to young Nicholas with a smile. "You and I haven't seen anything of
1|one another yet... How like he is growing, Mary!" he added, addressing
1|Countess Mary.
1|
1|"Like my father?" asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up
1|at Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.
1|
1|Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the
1|children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork;
1|Natasha did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denisov
1|rose, asked for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from
1|Sonya--who sat weary but resolute at the samovar--and questioned
1|Pierre. The curly-headed, delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed
1|in a corner, starting every now and then and muttering something to
1|himself, and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he
1|turned his curly head, with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down
1|collar, toward the place where Pierre sat.
1|
1|The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in
1|power, in which most people see the chief interest of home politics.
1|Denisov, dissatisfied with the government on account of his own
1|disappointments in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done
1|in Petersburg which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and
1|sharp comments on what Pierre told them.
1|
1|"One used to have to be a German--now one must dance with Tatawinova
1|and Madame Kwudener, and wead Ecka'tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they
1|should let that fine fellow Bonaparte lose--he'd knock all this
1|nonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Semenov wegiment
1|to a fellow like that Schwa'tz!" he cried.
1|
1|Nicholas, though free from Denisov's readiness to find fault with
1|everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a
1|very serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been
1|appointed Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that
1|the Emperor had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed
1|to him very important. And so he thought it necessary to take an
1|interest in these things and to question Pierre. The questions put
1|by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary
1|character of gossip about the higher government circles.
1|
1|But Natasha, knowing all her husband's ways and ideas, saw that he
1|had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation
1|to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake
1|of which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend
1|Prince Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with
1|Prince Theodore had gone.
1|
1|"What was it about?" asked Nicholas.
1|
1|"Always the same thing," said Pierre, looking round at his
1|listeners. "Everybody sees that things are going so badly that they
1|cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent
1|men to counteract it as far as they can."
1|
1|"What can decent men do?" Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly.
1|"What can be done?"
1|
1|"Why, this..."
1|
1|"Come into my study," said Nicholas.
1|
1|Natasha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby,
1|now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary
1|followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas
1|Bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the
1|writing table in a shady corner by the window.
1|
1|"Well, what would you do?" asked Denisov.
1|
1|"Always some fantastic schemes," said Nicholas.
1|
1|"Why this," began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,
1|sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: "the position in
1|Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He has
1|abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism" (Pierre could not
1|tolerate mysticism in anyone now). "He seeks only for peace, and
1|only these people sans foi ni loi* can give it him--people who
1|recklessly hack at and strangle everything--Magnitski, Arakcheev,
1|and tutti quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after
1|your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your
1|steward was the more readily your object might be attained," he said
1|to Nicholas.
1|
1|
1|*Without faith or law.
1|
1|
1|"Well, what does that lead up to?" said Nicholas.
1|
1|"Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in
1|the army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the
1|people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young
1|and honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on.
1|Everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,"
1|said Pierre (as those who examine the actions of any government have
1|always said since governments began). "I told them just one thing in
1|Petersburg."
1|
1|"Told whom?"
1|
1|"Well, you know whom," said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under
1|his brows. "Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and
1|philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in
1|the present circumstances something else is needed."
1|
1|At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face
1|darkened and he went up to the boy.
1|
1|"Why are you here?"
1|
1|"Why? Let him be," said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and
1|continuing. "That is not enough, I told them. Something else is
1|needed. When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at
1|any moment, when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe,
1|as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to
1|withstand the general calamity. Everything that is young and strong is
1|being enticed away and depraved. One is lured by women, another by
1|honors, a third by ambition or money, and they go over to that camp.
1|No independent men, such as you or I, are left. What I say is widen
1|the scope of our society, let the mot d'ordre be not virtue alone
1|but independence and action as well!"
1|
1|Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an
1|armchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing
1|discontentedly and frowning more and more.
1|
1|"But action with what aim?" he cried. "And what position will you
1|adopt toward the government?"
1|
1|"Why, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret
1|if the government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to
1|government, but it is a society of true conservatives--a society of
1|gentlemen in the full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some
1|Pugachev or other from killing my children and yours, and Arakcheev
1|from sending me off to some Military Settlement. We join hands only
1|for the public welfare and the general safety."
1|
1|"Yes, but it's a secret society and therefore a hostile and
1|harmful one which can only cause harm."
1|
1|"Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe" (they did not then
1|venture to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) "do any harm? The
1|Tugendbund is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it
1|is what Christ preached on the Cross."
1|
1|Natasha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at
1|her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her--that
1|did not even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely
1|simple and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her
1|because she knew that it sprang from Pierre's whole soul), but it
1|was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.
1|
1|The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down
1|collar--whom everyone had forgotten--gazed at Pierre with even greater
1|and more rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre's burned into his heart,
1|and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the
1|sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle's table.
1|
1|"It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German
1|Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing."
1|
1|"No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage
1|eaters, but I don't understand it and can't even pwonounce it,"
1|interposed Denisov in a loud and resolute voice. "I agwee that
1|evewything here is wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don't
1|understand. If we're not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own.
1|That's all wight. Je suis vot'e homme!"*
1|
1|
1|*"I'm your man."
1|
1|
1|Pierre smiled, Natasha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his
1|brows still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no
1|prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of
1|existed only in his imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and
1|as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas
1|felt himself cornered. This made him still angrier, for he was fully
1|convinced, not by reasoning but by something within him stronger
1|than reason, of the justice of his opinion.
1|
1|"I will tell you this," he said, rising and trying with nervously
1|twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally
1|abandoning the attempt. "I can't prove it to you. You say that
1|everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don't see
1|it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
1|matter, and to that I reply: 'You are my best friend, as you know, but
1|if you formed a secret society and began working against the
1|government--be it what it may--I know it is my duty to obey the
1|government. And if Arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
1|and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.'
1|And you may argue about that as you like!"
1|
1|An awkward silence followed these words. Natasha was the first to
1|speak, defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense
1|was weak and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was
1|resumed, and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas'
1|last remark.
1|
1|When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkonski
1|went up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.
1|
1|"Uncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree
1|with you?" he asked.
1|
1|And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex,
1|and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in
1|this boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said
1|he regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to
1|give him an answer.
1|
1|"Yes, I think so," he said reluctantly, and left the study.
1|
1|The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what
1|he had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to
1|Nicholas.
1|
1|"Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally," he said,
1|pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens.
1|
1|Nicholas started angrily.
1|
1|"All right, all right," he said, throwing the bits under the table.
1|
1|And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned
1|away from the boy.
1|
1|"You ought not to have been here at all," he said.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XV
1|
1|
1|The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies,
1|but turned on the subject Nicholas liked best--recollections of
1|1812. Denisov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable
1|and amusing about them. The family separated on the most friendly
1|terms.
1|
1|After supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given
1|instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to
1|the bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her
1|table, writing.
1|
1|"What are you writing, Mary?" Nicholas asked.
1|
1|Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing
1|would not be understood or approved by her husband.
1|
1|She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at
1|the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would
1|now have to tell him.
1|
1|"A diary, Nicholas," she replied, handing him a blue exercise book
1|filled with her firm, bold writing.
1|
1|"A diary?" Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up
1|the book.
1|
1|It was in French.
1|
1|
1|December 4. Today when Andrusha (her eldest boy) woke up he did
1|not wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was
1|naughty and obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then
1|I took the matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse's
1|help to get the other children up, telling him that I did not love
1|him. For a long time he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped
1|out of bed, ran to me in his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not
1|calm him for a long time. It was plain that what troubled him most was
1|that he had grieved me. Afterwards in the evening when I gave him
1|his ticket, he again began crying piteously and kissing me. One can do
1|anything with him by tenderness.
1|
1|
1|"What is a 'ticket'?" Nicholas inquired.
1|
1|"I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how
1|they have behaved."
1|
1|Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and
1|continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down
1|everything in the children's lives that seemed noteworthy to their
1|mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections
1|on educational methods. They were for the most part quite
1|insignificant trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the
1|father either, now that he read this diary about his children for
1|the first time.
1|
1|Under the date "5" was entered:
1|
1|
1|Mitya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding.
1|He had none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others
1|while they were eating! I think that punishment by depriving
1|children of sweets only develops their greediness. Must tell
1|Nicholas this.
1|
1|
1|Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant
1|eyes gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her
1|diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of
1|his admiration for his wife.
1|
1|Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or
1|even done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of
1|which the sole aim was the children's moral welfare delighted him. Had
1|Nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that
1|his steady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling
1|of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost
1|beyond his reach, in which she had her being.
1|
1|He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own
1|insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the
1|more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part
1|of himself.
1|
1|"I quite, quite approve, my dearest!" said he with a significant
1|look, and after a short pause he added: "And I behaved badly today.
1|You weren't in the study. We began disputing--Pierre and I--and I lost
1|my temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don't know what would
1|become of him if Natasha didn't keep him in hand.... Have you any idea
1|why he went to Petersburg? They have formed..."
1|
1|"Yes, I know," said Countess Mary. "Natasha told me."
1|
1|"Well, then, you know," Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere
1|recollection of their discussion, "he wanted to convince me that it is
1|every honest man's duty to go against the government, and that the
1|oath of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren't there. They
1|all fell on me--Denisov and Natasha... Natasha is absurd. How she
1|rules over him! And yet there need only be a discussion and she has no
1|words of her own but only repeats his sayings..." added Nicholas,
1|yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge
1|those nearest and dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying
1|about Natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in
1|relation to his wife.
1|
1|"Yes, I have noticed that," said Countess Mary.
1|
1|"When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he
1|started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there--what
1|would you have said?"
1|
1|"As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natasha so. Pierre
1|says everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that
1|it is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,"
1|said Countess Mary, "but he forgets that we have other duties nearer
1|to us, duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might
1|expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children."
1|
1|"Yes, that's it! That's just what I said to him," put in Nicholas,
1|who fancied he really had said it. "But they insisted on their own
1|view: love of one's neighbor and Christianity--and all this in the
1|presence of young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all
1|my things."
1|
1|"Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little
1|Nicholas," said Countess Mary. "He is such an exceptional boy. I am
1|afraid I neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and
1|relations while he has no one. He is constantly alone with his
1|thoughts."
1|
1|"Well, I don't think you need reproach yourself on his account.
1|All that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are
1|doing for him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine
1|lad! This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and
1|fancy--as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken
1|everything on my table to bits, and he told me of it himself at
1|once! I never knew him to tell an untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!"
1|repeated Nicholas, who at heart was not fond of Nicholas Bolkonski but
1|was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad.
1|
1|"Still, I am not the same as his own mother," said Countess Mary. "I
1|feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am
1|dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have
1|companions."
1|
1|"Well it won't be for long. Next summer I'll take him to
1|Petersburg," said Nicholas. "Yes, Pierre always was a dreamer and
1|always will be," he continued, returning to the talk in the study
1|which had evidently disturbed him. "Well, what business is it of
1|mine what goes on there--whether Arakcheev is bad, and all that?
1|What business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt
1|that I was threatened with prison, and had a mother who could not
1|see or understand it? And then there are you and the children and
1|our affairs. Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the
1|office from morning to night? No, but I know I must work to comfort my
1|mother, to repay you, and not to leave the children such beggars as
1|I was."
1|
1|Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread
1|alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But
1|she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do
1|so. She only took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of
1|approval and a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few
1|minutes' reflection continued to think aloud.
1|
1|"You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofanych" (this was his overseer)
1|"came back from the Tambov estate and told me they are already
1|offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest."
1|
1|And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
1|repurchasing Otradnoe before long, and added: "Another ten years of
1|life and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position."
1|
1|Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he
1|told her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would
1|sometimes ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he
1|noticed that she had been thinking about something else. But she had
1|to force herself to attend, for what he was saying did not interest
1|her at all. She looked at him and did not think, but felt, about
1|something different. She felt a submissive tender love for this man
1|who would never understand all that she understood, and this seemed to
1|make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate
1|tenderness. Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and
1|hindered her from following the details of her husband's plans,
1|thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted
1|through her mind. She thought of her nephew. Her husband's account
1|of the boy's agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her
1|forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive character
1|recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she thought
1|also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but
1|compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt
1|with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for
1|young Nicholas.
1|
1|Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
1|difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and
1|promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the
1|impossible--in this life to love her husband, her children, little
1|Nicholas, and all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess
1|Mary's soul always strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the
1|absolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of
1|the lofty, secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on
1|her face. Nicholas gazed at her. "O God! What will become of us if she
1|dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?" thought he, and
1|placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XVI
1|
1|
1|Natasha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband
1|and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,
1|understanding and expressing each other's thoughts in ways contrary to
1|all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and
1|in a quite peculiar way. Natasha was so used to this kind of talk with
1|her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being
1|wrong between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning.
1|When he began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly
1|and she, led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that
1|they were on the verge of a quarrel.
1|
1|From the moment they were alone and Natasha came up to him with
1|wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her
1|bosom, saying: "Now you are all mine, mine! You won't escape!"--from
1|that moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic
1|and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked
1|about at one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many
1|topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was
1|the surest sign that they fully understood one another.
1|
1|Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and
1|contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this
1|intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves
1|were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted
1|them.
1|
1|Natasha spoke to Pierre about her brother's life and doings, of
1|how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of
1|how she was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way
1|better than herself. In saying this Natasha was sincere in
1|acknowledging Mary's superiority, but at the same time by saying it
1|she made a demand on Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her
1|to Mary and to all other women, and that now, especially after
1|having seen many women in Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.
1|
1|Pierre, answering Natasha's words, told her how intolerable it had
1|been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.
1|
1|"I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies," he said. "It was
1|simply dull. Besides, I was very busy."
1|
1|Natasha looked intently at him and went on:
1|
1|"Mary is so splendid," she said. "How she understands children! It
1|is as if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance,
1|Mitya was naughty..."
1|
1|"How like his father he is," Pierre interjected.
1|
1|Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya's likeness to Nicholas: the
1|recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and
1|he wanted to know what Natasha thought of it.
1|
1|"Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not
1|generally accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a
1|fresh line," said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.
1|
1|"No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are
1|an amusement--almost a pastime," said Pierre. "For instance, he is
1|collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till
1|he has read what he had already bought--Sismondi and Rousseau and
1|Montesquieu," he added with a smile. "You know how much I..." he began
1|to soften down what he had said; but Natasha interrupted him to show
1|that this was unnecessary.
1|
1|"So you say ideas are an amusement to him...."
1|
1|"Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg
1|I saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all
1|else is mere amusement."
1|
1|"Ah, I'm so sorry I wasn't there when you met the children," said
1|Natasha. "Which was most delighted? Lisa, I'm sure."
1|
1|"Yes," Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind.
1|"Nicholas says we ought not to think. But I can't help it. Besides,
1|when I was in Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole
1|affair would go to pieces without me--everyone was pulling his own
1|way. But I succeeded in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear
1|and simple. You see, I don't say that we ought to oppose this and
1|that. We may be mistaken. What I say is: 'Join hands, you who love the
1|right, and let there be but one banner--that of active virtue.' Prince
1|Sergey is a fine fellow and clever."
1|
1|Natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre's
1|idea, but one thing disconcerted her. "Can a man so important and
1|necessary to society be also my husband? How did this happen?" She
1|wished to express this doubt to him. "Now who could decide whether
1|he is really cleverer than all the others?" she asked herself, and
1|passed in review all those whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what
1|he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as Platon
1|Karataev.
1|
1|"Do you know what I am thinking about?" she asked. "About Platon
1|Karataev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?"
1|
1|Pierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood
1|his wife's line of thought.
1|
1|"Platon Karataev?" he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely
1|trying to imagine Karataev's opinion on the subject. "He would not
1|have understood... yet perhaps he would."
1|
1|"I love you awfully!" Natasha suddenly said. "Awfully, awfully!"
1|
1|"No, he would not have approved," said Pierre, after reflection.
1|"What he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so
1|anxious to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and
1|I should have been proud to let him see us. There now--you talk of
1|my absence, but you wouldn't believe what a special feeling I have for
1|you after a separation...."
1|
1|"Yes, I should think..." Natasha began.
1|
1|"No, it's not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldn't
1|love more, but this is something special.... Yes, of course-" he did
1|not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.
1|
1|"What nonsense it is," Natasha suddenly exclaimed, "about
1|honeymoons, and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the
1|contrary, now is the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do
1|you remember how we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always
1|mine. And what we quarreled about--I don't even remember!"
1|
1|"Always about the same thing," said Pierre with a smile. "Jealo..."
1|
1|"Don't say it! I can't bear it!" Natasha cried, and her eyes
1|glittered coldly and vindictively. "Did you see her?" she added, after
1|a pause.
1|
1|"No, and if I had I shouldn't have recognized her."
1|
1|They were silent for a while.
1|
1|"Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at
1|you," Natasha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
1|come over them. "You are as like him as two peas--like the boy." (She
1|meant her little son.) "Oh, it's time to go to him.... The milk's
1|come.... But I'm sorry to leave you."
1|
1|They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one
1|another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with
1|self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha with a quiet, happy smile.
1|Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other
1|continue.
1|
1|"No. What did you say? Go on, go on."
1|
1|"No, you go on, I was talking nonsense," said Natasha.
1|
1|Pierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his
1|complacent reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it
1|seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the
1|whole of Russian society and to the whole world.
1|
1|"I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are
1|always simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united
1|and constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now
1|that's simple enough."
1|
1|"Yes."
1|
1|"And what were you going to say?"
1|
1|"I? Only nonsense."
1|
1|"But all the same?"
1|
1|"Oh nothing, only a trifle," said Natasha, smilingly still more
1|brightly. "I only wanted to tell you about Petya: today nurse was
1|coming to take him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung
1|to me. I'm sure he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now
1|he's crying. Well, good-by!" and she left the room.
1|
1|
1|Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski's bedroom a
1|little lamp was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark
1|and they could not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four
1|pillows and his Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring.
1|Little Nicholas, who had just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat
1|up in bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from
1|a terrible dream. He had dreamed that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing
1|helmets such as were depicted in his Plutarch, were leading a huge
1|army. The army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air
1|like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which Dessalles called
1|les fils de la Vierge. In front was Glory, which was similar to
1|those threads but rather thicker. He and Pierre were borne along
1|lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their goal. Suddenly the
1|threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it
1|grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before them in a
1|stern and threatening attitude.
1|
1|"Have you done this?" he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and
1|pens. "I loved you, but I have orders from Arakcheev and will kill the
1|first of you who moves forward." Little Nicholas turned to look at
1|Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his
1|father--Prince Andrew--and his father had neither shape nor form, but
1|he existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with
1|love: he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father
1|caressed and pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to
1|them. Terror seized young Nicholas and he awoke.
1|
1|"My father!" he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of
1|Prince Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human
1|form.) "My father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of
1|me and of Uncle Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it.
1|Mucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing
1|happen to me? I know they want me to learn. And I will learn. But
1|someday I shall have finished learning, and then I will do
1|something. I only pray God that something may happen to me such as
1|happened to Plutarch's men, and I will act as they did. I will do
1|better. Everyone shall know me, love me, and be delighted with me!"
1|And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry.
1|
1|"Are you ill?" he heard Dessalles' voice asking.
1|
1|"No," answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.
1|
1|"He is good and kind and I am fond of him!" he thought of Dessalles.
1|"But Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father?
1|Oh, Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he
1|would be satisfied...."

1|SECOND EPILOGUE
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER I
1|
1|
1|History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put
1|into words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a
1|single nation, appears impossible.
1|
1|The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to
1|describe and seize the apparently elusive--the life of a people.
1|They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and
1|regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the
1|whole nation.
1|
1|The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished
1|and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the
1|ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations
1|to the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so
1|as to accomplish ends that were predestined.
1|
1|For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the
1|direct participation of the Deity in human affairs.
1|
1|Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.
1|
1|It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in
1|man's subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward
1|which nations are led, modern history should study not the
1|manifestations of power but the causes that produce it. But modern
1|history has not done this. Having in theory rejected the view held
1|by the ancients, it still follows them in practice.
1|
1|Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by
1|the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed
1|with extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very
1|various kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses.
1|Instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or
1|Roman nations, which ancient historians regarded as representing the
1|progress of humanity, modern history has postulated its own aims--the
1|welfare of the French, German, or English people, or, in its highest
1|abstraction, the welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by
1|which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small
1|northwesterly portion of a large continent.
1|
1|Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
1|replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has
1|obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the
1|divine authority of the kings and the "fate" of the ancients, to reach
1|the same conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations
1|guided by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to
1|which these nations and humanity at large are tending.
1|
1|At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon
1|to Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent
1|novelty of their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.
1|
1|In the first place the historian describes the activity of
1|individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian
1|considers only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men,
1|while another includes also orators, learned men, reformers,
1|philosophers, and poets). Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward
1|which humanity is being led is known to the historians: to one of them
1|this goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, or French realm;
1|to another it is liberty, equality, and a certain kind of civilization
1|of a small corner of the world called Europe.
1|
1|In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is
1|expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it
1|moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east
1|westward. In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with
1|remarkable symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west,
1|attracting to it, as the first movement had done, the nations of
1|middle Europe. The counter movement reaches the starting point of
1|the first movement in the west--Paris--and subsides.
1|
1|During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left
1|untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions of
1|men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions of
1|Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
1|another.
1|
1|What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people
1|burn houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these
1|events? What force made men act so? These are the instinctive,
1|plain, and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it
1|encounters the monuments and tradition of that period.
1|
1|For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns
1|to the science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity
1|to know themselves.
1|
1|If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
1|said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and
1|directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that
1|reply, would have been clear and complete. One might believe or
1|disbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone
1|believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the
1|history of that period, nor would there have been any contradictions.
1|
1|But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit
1|the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the
1|Deity in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other
1|answers.
1|
1|Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know
1|what this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced
1|these events? Then listen:
1|
1|"Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such
1|and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France
1|badly. His descendants were weak men and they too ruled France
1|badly. And they had such and such favorites and such and such
1|mistresses. Moreover, certain men wrote some books at that time. At
1|the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men
1|in Paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal. This
1|caused people all over France to begin to slash at and drown one
1|another. They killed the king and many other people. At that time
1|there was in France a man of genius--Napoleon. He conquered
1|everybody everywhere--that is, he killed many people because he was
1|a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and
1|killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he
1|returned to France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all
1|obeyed him. Having become an Emperor he again went out to kill
1|people in Italy, Austria, and Prussia. And there too he killed a great
1|many. In Russia there was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to
1|restore order in Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807
1|he suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled
1|and again began killing many people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand
1|men into Russia and captured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from
1|Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and
1|others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace. All
1|Napoleon's allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces
1|advanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated
1|Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him
1|to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and
1|showing him every respect, though five years before and one year later
1|they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII,
1|who till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the
1|Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears before his Old
1|Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then the skillful
1|statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who managed to
1|sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended
1|the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by these conversations
1|made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the diplomatists and
1|monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering
1|their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon arrived in
1|France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating him,
1|immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were angry
1|at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated
1|the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent
1|him to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the
1|beloved France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that
1|rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a
1|reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress
1|their subjects."
1|
1|It would be a mistake to think that this is ironic--a caricature
1|of the historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild
1|expression of the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions,
1|which all the historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the
1|histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and
1|the new histories of the culture of that period.
1|
1|The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact
1|that modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has
1|asked.
1|
1|If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement
1|of humanity and of the peoples, the first question--in the absence
1|of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible--is: what is
1|the power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously
1|replies either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was
1|very proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.
1|
1|All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it
1|is not what was asked. All that would be interesting if we
1|recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently
1|directing its nations through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we
1|do not acknowledge such a power, and therefore before speaking about
1|Napoleons, Louis-es, and authors, we ought to be shown the
1|connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations.
1|
1|If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it
1|should be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole
1|interest of history lies precisely in that force.
1|
1|History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to
1|everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone
1|reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
1|force, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really
1|quite well known to everybody.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER II
1|
1|
1|What force moves the nations?
1|
1|Biographical historians and historians of separate nations
1|understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In
1|their narration events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and
1|Alexander, or in general of the persons they describe. The answers
1|given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes
1|events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one
1|historian to each event. As soon as historians of different
1|nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event, the
1|replies they give immediately lose all meaning, for this force is
1|understood by them all not only differently but often in quite
1|contradictory ways. One historian says that an event was produced by
1|Napoleon's power, another that it was produced by Alexander's, a third
1|that it was due to the power of some other person. Besides this,
1|historians of that kind contradict each other even in their
1|statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular
1|person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon's power
1|was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was
1|based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians
1|of this class, by mutually destroying one another's positions, destroy
1|the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no
1|reply to history's essential question.
1|
1|Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
1|recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians' view of the
1|force which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power
1|inherent in heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a
1|multiplicity of variously directed forces. In describing a war or
1|the subjugation of a people, a general historian looks for the cause
1|of the event not in the power of one man, but in the interaction of
1|many persons connected with the event.
1|
1|According to this view the power of historical personages,
1|represented as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would
1|seem, be regarded as a force that itself produces events. Yet in
1|most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power
1|as a force that itself produces events, and treat it as their cause.
1|In their exposition, an historic character is first the product of his
1|time, and his power only the resultant of various forces, and then his
1|power is itself a force producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and
1|others, for instance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a product of
1|the Revolution, of the ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at another
1|plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not
1|like were simply the product of Napoleon's misdirected will, and
1|that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by
1|Napoleon's caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper
1|of the age produced Napoleon's power. But Napoleon's power
1|suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the
1|age.
1|
1|This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur
1|at every step, but the universal historians' accounts are all made
1|up of a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs
1|because after entering the field of analysis the universal
1|historians stop halfway.
1|
1|To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant
1|force, the sum of the components must equal the resultant. This
1|condition is never observed by the universal historians, and so to
1|explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to
1|the insufficient components, another unexplained force affecting the
1|resultant action.
1|
1|Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the
1|restoration of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were
1|produced by the will of Alexander. But the universal historian
1|Gervinus, refuting this opinion of the specialist historian, tries to
1|prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons
1|were due to other things beside Alexander's will--such as the activity
1|of Stein, Metternich, Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, Fichte
1|Chateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently decomposes
1|Alexander's power into the components: Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, and
1|the rest--but the sum of the components, that is, the interactions of
1|Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and the others, evidently
1|does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of millions of
1|Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, Madame de
1|Stael, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected
1|their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of
1|millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
1|the submission of millions of people resulted--that is, how component
1|forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times
1|A--the historian is again obliged to fall back on power--the force he
1|had denied--and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that
1|is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And
1|that is just what the universal historians do, and consequently they
1|not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict
1|themselves.
1|
1|Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to
1|whether they want rain or fine weather: "The wind has blown the clouds
1|away," or, "The wind has brought up the clouds." And in the same way
1|the universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in
1|with their theory, say that power is the result of events, and
1|sometimes, when they want to prove something else, say that power
1|produces events.
1|
1|A third class of historians--the so-called historians of
1|culture--following the path laid down by the universal historians who
1|sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events--again
1|take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what
1|is called culture--in mental activity.
1|
1|The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
1|progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical
1|events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
1|another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that
1|such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense
1|number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these
1|historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that
1|this indication is the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove
1|that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity, only by a
1|great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between
1|intellectual activity and the movement of peoples, and in no case
1|can one admit that intellectual activity controls people's actions,
1|for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders
1|of the French Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality
1|of man, or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the
1|preaching of love.
1|
1|But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments
1|with which these histories are filled--admitting that nations are
1|governed by some undefined force called an idea--history's essential
1|question still remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs
1|and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the
1|universal historians, another, newer force--the idea--is added, the
1|connection of which with the masses needs explanation. It is
1|possible to understand that Napoleon had power and so events occurred;
1|with some effort one may even conceive that Napoleon together with
1|other influences was the cause of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat
1|social, had the effect of making Frenchmen begin to drown one
1|another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal
1|nexus of this new force with the event.
1|
1|Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live
1|contemporaneously, and so it is possible to find some connection
1|between the intellectual activity of men and their historical
1|movements, just as such a connection may be found between the
1|movements of humanity and commerce, handicraft, gardening, or anything
1|else you please. But why intellectual activity is considered by the
1|historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole
1|historical movement is hard to understand. Only the following
1|considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1)
1|that history is written by learned men, and so it is natural and
1|agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
1|supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a
1|similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists,
1|and soldiers (if they do not express it, that is merely because
1|traders and soldiers do not write history), and (2) that spiritual
1|activity, enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas, are all
1|indistinct, indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very
1|easy to use words having a still less definite meaning, and which
1|can therefore be readily introduced into any theory.
1|
1|But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this
1|kind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something)
1|the histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and
1|more to approximate, are significant from the fact that after
1|seriously and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and
1|political doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to
1|describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for
1|instance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise
1|of power--and say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon's will.
1|Speaking so, the historians of culture involuntarily contradict
1|themselves, and show that the new force they have devised does not
1|account for what happens in history, and that history can only be
1|explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not
1|recognize.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER III
1|
1|
1|A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: "What moves it?" A peasant
1|says the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because
1|its wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement
1|lies in the smoke which the wind carries away.
1|
1|The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation.
1|To refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no
1|devil, or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is
1|not the devil but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as
1|a result of the contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong.
1|But the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause
1|refutes himself, for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on
1|and explain further why the wheels go round; and till he has reached
1|the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure
1|of steam in the boiler, he has no right to stop in his search for
1|the cause. The man who explains the movement of the locomotive by
1|the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not
1|supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to
1|him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation.
1|
1|The only conception that can explain the movement of the
1|locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.
1|
1|The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples
1|is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the
1|peoples.
1|
1|Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
1|different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement
1|observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the
1|peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force
1|resulting from several other forces, like the movement of the
1|wheels; others again as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that
1|is blown away.
1|
1|So long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether
1|Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories of
1|all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite
1|impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
1|of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain
1|end. And the only such conception known to historians is that of
1|power.
1|
1|This conception is the one handle by means of which the material
1|of history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who
1|breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other
1|method of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the
1|one possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception
1|of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated
1|by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves,
1|for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have
1|recourse to it at every step.
1|
1|In dealing with humanity's inquiry, the science of history up to now
1|is like money in circulation--paper money and coin. The biographies
1|and special national histories are like paper money. They can be
1|used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to
1|anyone and even advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the
1|security behind them. You need only forget to ask how the will of
1|heroes produces events, and such histories as Thiers' will be
1|interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of
1|poetry. But just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise
1|either because, being easy to make, too much of it gets made or
1|because people try to exchange it for gold, so also doubts
1|concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too
1|many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone
1|inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?--that is, wants to
1|exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
1|comprehension.
1|
1|The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
1|like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to
1|substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific
1|gravity of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more
1|than that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is
1|deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle.
1|As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange
1|but also for use, so universal historians will be valuable only when
1|they can reply to history's essential question: what is power? The
1|universal historians give contradictory replies to that question,
1|while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite
1|different. And as counters of imitation gold can be used only among
1|a group of people who agree to accept them as gold, or among those who
1|do not know the nature of gold, so universal historians and historians
1|of culture, not answering humanity's essential question, serve as
1|currency for some purposes of their own, only in universities and
1|among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call "serious
1|reading."

1|CHAPTER IV
1|
1|
1|Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
1|subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the
1|subjection of that man's will to the Deity, history cannot without
1|contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two
1|things: either a return to the former belief in the direct
1|intervention of the Deity in human affairs or a definite explanation
1|of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed
1|"power."
1|
1|A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been
1|destroyed; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.
1|
1|Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so
1|accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the
1|question: why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon
1|uttered certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and
1|so what he ordered was done.
1|
1|This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was
1|given him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes
1|essential to determine what is this power of one man over others.
1|
1|It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak
1|one--a domination based on the application or threat of physical
1|force, like the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect
1|of moral force, as in their simplicity some historians think who say
1|that the leading figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted
1|with a special strength of soul and mind called genius. This power
1|cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength, for, not to
1|mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions
1|differ widely, history shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a
1|Metternich, who ruled over millions of people, had any particular
1|moral qualities, but on the contrary were generally morally weaker
1|than any of the millions they ruled over.
1|
1|If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
1|qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for
1|elsewhere--in the relation to the people of the man who wields the
1|power.
1|
1|And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,
1|that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history's
1|understanding of power for true gold.
1|
1|Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed
1|or tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.
1|
1|In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how
1|a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to
1|be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that
1|definition of power needs explanation.
1|
1|The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the
1|ancients regarded fire--namely, as something existing absolutely.
1|But for history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for
1|modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.
1|
1|From this fundamental difference between the view held by history
1|and that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell
1|minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
1|power--existing immutably outside time--is, but to history's questions
1|about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
1|nothing.
1|
1|If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
1|ruler, was Pugachev a representative of the will of the people? If
1|not, then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when
1|he was taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those
1|criminals whom he arrested?
1|
1|Do palace revolutions--in which sometimes only two or three people
1|take part--transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In
1|international relations, is the will of the people also transferred to
1|their conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine
1|transferred to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people
1|transferred to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the
1|French went to fight the Austrians?
1|
1|To these questions three answers are possible:
1|
1|Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always
1|unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen,
1|and that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle
1|against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as
1|an infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the
1|people is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite
1|and known conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and
1|even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers
1|of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or
1|(3) that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers
1|conditionally, but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and
1|that the appearance of several authorities, their struggles and
1|their falls, result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by
1|the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people
1|is transferred from some people to others.
1|
1|And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain
1|the relation of the people to their rulers.
1|
1|Some historians--those biographical and specialist historians
1|already referred to--in their simplicity failing to understand the
1|question of the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective
1|will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical
1|persons, and therefore when describing some single state they assume
1|that particular power to be the one absolute and real power, and
1|that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of
1|power--mere violence.
1|
1|Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of
1|history, has the inconvenience--in application to complex and stormy
1|periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise
1|simultaneously and struggle with one another--that a Legitimist
1|historian will prove that the National Convention, the Directory,
1|and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power, while a
1|Republican and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that the Convention
1|and the other that the Empire was the real power, and that all the
1|others were violations of power. Evidently the explanations
1|furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only
1|satisfy young children.
1|
1|Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of
1|historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the
1|will of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have
1|power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will
1|of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this
1|program consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they
1|continually contradict one another.
1|
1|Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation's
1|progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth,
1|freedom, or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country.
1|But not to mention the historians' contradictions as to the nature
1|of this program--or even admitting that some one general program of
1|these conditions exists--the facts of history almost always contradict
1|that theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted
1|consist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how
1|is it that Louis XIV and Ivan the Terrible end their reigns
1|tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their
1|people? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV's activity,
1|contrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did it not
1|react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV--why should it react just on Louis
1|XVI? And what is the time limit for such reactions? To these questions
1|there are and can be no answers. Equally little does this view explain
1|why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from
1|certain rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of
1|fifty years is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to
1|Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to
1|Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to
1|Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers of the people's
1|will from one individual to another, especially in view of
1|international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians
1|are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal
1|delegations of the people's will but are accidents dependent on
1|cunning, on mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a
1|ruler, or a party leader. So that the greater part of the events of
1|history--civil wars, revolutions, and conquests--are presented by
1|these historians not as the results of free transferences of the
1|people's will, but as results of the ill-directed will of one or
1|more individuals, that is, once again, as usurpations of power. And so
1|these historians also see and admit historical events which are
1|exceptions to the theory.
1|
1|These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some
1|plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that
1|all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the
1|palm, the mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth
1|and no longer resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.
1|
1|Historians of the third class assume that the will of the people
1|is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the
1|conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have
1|power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has
1|been delegated to them.
1|
1|But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the
1|historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have
1|those leaders?
1|
1|The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the
1|people: the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the
1|people.
1|
1|But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
1|leaders serves as an expression of the people's will or only some part
1|of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression
1|of the people's will, as some historians suppose, then all the details
1|of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or
1|a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is
1|evident nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the
1|activity of an historical leader which serves to express the
1|people's life, as other so-called "philosophical" historians
1|believe, then to determine which side of the activity of a leader
1|expresses the nation's life, we have first of all to know in what
1|the nation's life consists.
1|
1|Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
1|obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all
1|conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of
1|humanity's movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by
1|almost all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment,
1|progress, civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization
1|as the goal of the movement of humanity, the historians study the
1|men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained: kings,
1|ministers, generals, authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to
1|the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or
1|hindered that abstraction. But as it is in no way proved that the
1|aim of humanity does consist in freedom, equality, enlightenment, or
1|civilization, and as the connection of the people with the rulers
1|and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption
1|that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the
1|men whom we have noticed, it happens that the activity of the millions
1|who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, and destroy one another
1|never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people
1|who did not burn houses, practice agriculture, or slay their fellow
1|creatures.
1|
1|History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples
1|of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive
1|eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their
1|mistresses and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau,
1|Diderot, Beaumarchais, and others?
1|
1|Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazan and
1|Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Ivan the
1|Terrible and by his correspondence with Kurbski?
1|
1|Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained
1|by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their
1|ladies? For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without
1|leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit,
1|remains incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the
1|cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the
1|Crusade--the deliverance of Jerusalem--had been clearly defined by
1|historic leaders. Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples to
1|free the Holy Land; but the people did not go, for the unknown cause
1|which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed. The
1|history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover
1|the life of the peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and the
1|Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers,
1|but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has
1|remained unknown.
1|
1|Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us
1|the life of the peoples.
1|
1|The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
1|life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had a
1|hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was
1|suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why
1|after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why
1|during the French Revolution they guillotined one another.
1|
1|If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest
1|historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not
1|the history of the life of the peoples.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER V
1|
1|
1|The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few
1|men, for the connection between those men and the nations has not been
1|found. The theory that this connection is based on the transference of
1|the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
1|hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.
1|
1|The theory of the transference of the collective will of the
1|people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of
1|jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes, but in its
1|application to history, as soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil
1|wars occur--that is, as soon as history begins--that theory explains
1|nothing.
1|
1|The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of
1|the people's will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.
1|
1|Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the
1|theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead
1|because the collective will was transferred to him.
1|
1|The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
1|replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and
1|paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in
1|different parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman,
1|should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens
1|to be at its head.
1|
1|"The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
1|it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in
1|that leader." This is what historians of the first class say--those
1|who assume the unconditional transference of the people's will.
1|
1|"If the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the
1|collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
1|another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them
1|in the direction selected by the whole herd." Such is the reply
1|historians who assume that the collective will of the people is
1|delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With
1|this method of observation it often happens that the observer,
1|influenced by the direction he himself prefers, regards those as
1|leaders who, owing to the people's change of direction, are no
1|longer in front, but on one side, or even in the rear.)
1|
1|"If the animals in front are continually changing and the
1|direction of the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because
1|in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will
1|to the animals that have attracted our attention, and to study the
1|movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent
1|animals moving on all sides of the herd." So say the third class of
1|historians who regard all historical persons, from monarchs to
1|journalists, as the expression of their age.
1|
1|The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
1|persons is merely a paraphrase--a restatement of the question in other
1|words.
1|
1|What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the
1|collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what
1|condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On
1|condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people.
1|That is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning
1|of which we do not understand.
1|
1|
1|If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,
1|then having subjected to criticism the explanation of "power" that
1|juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is
1|merely a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena
1|man has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies
1|his reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a
1|word but an actually existing phenomenon.
1|
1|Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective
1|activity of men can do without the conception of power, the
1|existence of power is proved both by history and by observing
1|contemporary events.
1|
1|Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose
1|will the event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree
1|and the French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue
1|decrees and an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and
1|an army enters Russia. Alexander I gives a command and the French
1|submit to the Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs
1|it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have
1|decreed it.
1|
1|The historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine
1|intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in
1|the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that
1|supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.
1|
1|On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man's
1|will--his words--are only part of the general activity expressed in an
1|event, as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without
1|assuming an incomprehensible, supernatural force--a miracle--one
1|cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of
1|millions of men. On the other hand, even if we admitted that words
1|could be the cause of events, history shows that the expression of the
1|will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any
1|effect, that is to say, their commands are often not executed, and
1|sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs.
1|
1|Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity
1|we cannot regard "power" as the cause of events.
1|
1|Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation
1|that exists between the expression of someone's will and the execution
1|of that will by others.
1|
1|To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first
1|establish a conception of the expression of will, referring it to
1|man and not to the Deity.
1|
1|If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient
1|history tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time
1|and is not caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by
1|an event. But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will
1|of men acting in time and in relation to one another, to explain the
1|connection of commands with events we must restore: (1) the
1|condition of all that takes place: the continuity of movement in
1|time both of the events and of the person who commands, and (2) the
1|inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and
1|those who execute his command.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VI
1|
1|
1|Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time,
1|can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of
1|years or centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can
1|by His sole will determine the direction of humanity's movement; but
1|man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs.
1|
1|Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that
1|no command can be executed without some preceding order having been
1|given rendering the execution of the last command possible.
1|
1|No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole
1|series of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and
1|never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only
1|of an event.
1|
1|When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to
1|war, we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of
1|consecutive commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have
1|commanded an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered
1|such and such papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to
1|Petersburg; tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the
1|fleet, the commissariat, and so on and so on--millions of commands,
1|which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events
1|which brought the French armies into Russia.
1|
1|If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an
1|invasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so much
1|time and effort, and yet during his whole reign never once attempted
1|to execute that design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with
1|which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance (a
1|conviction he repeatedly expressed)--this came about because his
1|commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case,
1|but did so correspond in the latter.
1|
1|For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man
1|should order what can be executed. But to know what can and what
1|cannot be executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon's
1|invasion of Russia in which millions participated, but even in the
1|simplest event, for in either case millions of obstacles may arise
1|to prevent its execution. Every order executed is always one of an
1|immense number unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with
1|the course of events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get
1|linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a
1|series of events, and are executed.
1|
1|Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which
1|precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and
1|out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent
1|with that event have been executed, we forget about the others that
1|were not executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the
1|chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in
1|the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and
1|petty events, such for instance as all those which led the French
1|armies to Russia, is generalized into one event in accord with the
1|result produced by that series of events, and corresponding with
1|this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized
1|into a single expression of will.
1|
1|We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In
1|reality in all Napoleon's activity we never find anything resembling
1|an expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or
1|expressions of his will, very variously and indefinitely directed.
1|Amid a long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon's one series,
1|for the campaign of 1812, was carried out--not because those orders
1|differed in any way from the other, unexecuted orders but because they
1|coincided with the course of events that led the French army into
1|Russia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not
1|because the color was laid on from this side or in that way, but
1|because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the
1|stencil.
1|
1|So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the
1|events, we find that a command can never be the cause of the event,
1|but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two.
1|
1|To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
1|reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not
1|from the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the
1|command himself takes part in the event.
1|
1|This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what
1|is called power. This relation consists in the following:
1|
1|For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in
1|which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common
1|action, the relation between those taking part in it is always the
1|same.
1|
1|Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations
1|toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share,
1|and the smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action
1|for which they have combined.
1|
1|Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one
1|of the most striking and definite examples is an army.
1|
1|Every army is composed of lower grades of the service--the rank
1|and file--of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next
1|higher military rank--corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom
1|there are fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are
1|still fewer, and so on to the highest military command which is
1|concentrated in one person.
1|
1|A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone,
1|of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and
1|file; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of
1|the next higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point
1|of which will represent the commander in chief.
1|
1|The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section
1|of the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing,
1|hacking, burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for
1|these actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The
1|noncommissioned officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the
1|action itself less frequently than the soldiers, but they already give
1|commands. An officer still less often acts directly himself, but
1|commands still more frequently. A general does nothing but command the
1|troops, indicates the objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon
1|himself. The commander in chief never takes direct part in the
1|action itself, but only gives general orders concerning the movement
1|of the mass of the troops. A similar relation of people to one another
1|is seen in every combination of men for common activity--in
1|agriculture, trade, and every administration.
1|
1|And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of
1|a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in
1|any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to
1|the highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action,
1|combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in
1|performing the action the less they can command and the more
1|numerous they are, while the less their direct participation in the
1|action itself, the more they command and the fewer of them there
1|are; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top,
1|who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his
1|activity chiefly to commanding.
1|
1|This relation of the men who command to those they command is what
1|constitutes the essence of the conception called power.
1|
1|Having restored the condition of time under which all events
1|occur, we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a
1|corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of
1|relation between those who command and those who execute, we find that
1|by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest
1|part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively
1|directed to commanding.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VII
1|
1|
1|When an event is taking place people express their opinions and
1|wishes about it, and as the event results from the collective activity
1|of many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure
1|to be fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions
1|expressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event
1|as a command preceding it.
1|
1|Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to
1|how and where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens
1|that this is done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have
1|command and power in their primary form. The man who worked most
1|with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing, or
1|reflect on or command what would result from the common activity;
1|while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his
1|hands on account of his greater verbal activity.
1|
1|When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common
1|aim there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their
1|activity is given to directing and commanding, take less part in the
1|direct work.
1|
1|When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections
1|which as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his
1|present activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just
1|the same is done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not
1|take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations,
1|justifications, and surmises concerning their collective activity.
1|
1|For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and
1|kill one another. And corresponding to the event its justification
1|appears in people's belief that this was necessary for the welfare
1|of France, for liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one
1|another, and this event was accompanied by its justification in the
1|necessity for a centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and
1|so on. Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men,
1|and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France,
1|the baseness of England, and so on. History shows us that these
1|justifications of the events have no common sense and are all
1|contradictory, as in the case of killing a man as the result of
1|recognizing his rights, and the killing of millions in Russia for
1|the humiliation of England. But these justifications have a very
1|necessary significance in their own day.
1|
1|These justifications release those who produce the events from moral
1|responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
1|of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they
1|clear men's moral responsibilities from their path.
1|
1|Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
1|question that presents itself when examining each historical event.
1|How is it that millions of men commit collective crimes--make war,
1|commit murder, and so on?
1|
1|With the present complex forms of political and social life in
1|Europe can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by
1|monarchs, ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is
1|there any collective action which cannot find its justification in
1|political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in
1|civilization? So that every event that occurs inevitably coincides
1|with some expressed wish and, receiving a justification, presents
1|itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men.
1|
1|In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts
1|will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship
1|the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.
1|
1|Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that
1|flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince
1|ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement
1|of the ship, and that we were led into error by the fact that we
1|ourselves were imperceptibly moving.
1|
1|We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of
1|historical characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable
1|condition of all that occurs--the continuity of movement in time)
1|and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical
1|persons with the masses.
1|
1|When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same
1|wave ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also
1|turns frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the
1|wave anticipating its movement.
1|
1|Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen
1|and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither
1|directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a
1|distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the
1|ship's movement also.
1|
1|
1|Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
1|which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed
1|that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events
1|themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
1|the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
1|events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however
1|many commands were issued, the event does not take place unless
1|there are other causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs--be it
1|what it may--then out of all the continually expressed wishes of
1|different people some will always be found which by their meaning
1|and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events.
1|
1|Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively
1|to these two essential questions of history:
1|
1|(1) What is power?
1|
1|(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?
1|
1|(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, in
1|which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and
1|justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is
1|his participation in that action.
1|
1|(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by
1|intellectual activity, nor even by a combination of the two as
1|historians have supposed, but by the activity of all the people who
1|participate in the events, and who always combine in such a way that
1|those taking the largest direct share in the event take on
1|themselves the least responsibility and vice versa.
1|
1|Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event;
1|physically it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral
1|activity is inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event
1|is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.
1|
1|Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to
1|the phenomena we are examining.
1|
1|In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity--that final
1|limit to which in every domain of thought man's reason arrives if it
1|is not playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat
1|produces electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one
1|another.
1|
1|Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we
1|cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is
1|inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law.
1|The same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we
1|do not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,
1|people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and
1|we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in
1|other words that it is a law.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER VIII
1|
1|
1|If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment
1|of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have
1|finished our argument. But the law of history relates to man. A
1|particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of
1|attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is
1|the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not
1|subject to the law.
1|
1|The presence of the problem of man's free will, though
1|unexpressed, is felt at every step of history.
1|
1|All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered
1|this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and
1|the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the
1|lack of a solution of that question.
1|
1|If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act
1|as he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected
1|incidents.
1|
1|If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely,
1|that is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that
1|man's in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy
1|the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of
1|humanity.
1|
1|If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will
1|cannot exist, for then man's will is subject to that law.
1|
1|In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most
1|ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most
1|ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.
1|
1|The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from
1|whatever point of view--theological, historical, ethical, or
1|philosophic--we find a general law of necessity to which he (like
1|all that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves
1|as what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.
1|
1|This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from
1|and independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself,
1|but only through consciousness does he know himself.
1|
1|Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of
1|reason is conceivable.
1|
1|To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of
1|all be conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of
1|himself as a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is
1|conscious of his volition. But his will--which forms the essence of
1|his life--man recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.
1|
1|If, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed
1|by one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking
1|food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this
1|never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation
1|of it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man's will seems to
1|him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as
1|free.
1|
1|You say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.
1|Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable
1|demonstration of freedom.
1|
1|That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not
1|subject to reason.
1|
1|If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and
1|independent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to
1|reasoning and to experience, but in fact such subjection does not
1|exist and is inconceivable.
1|
1|A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he,
1|as an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man
1|submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or
1|impermeability once he has become acquainted with them. But the same
1|series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete
1|freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible, and that
1|his every action depends on his organization, his character, and the
1|motives acting upon him; yet man never submits to the deductions of
1|these experiments and arguments. Having learned from experiment and
1|argument that a stone falls downwards, a man indubitably believes this
1|and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled.
1|
1|But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws,
1|he does not and cannot believe this.
1|
1|However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
1|same conditions and with the same character he will do the same
1|thing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the
1|same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that
1|always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before
1|the experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or
1|sage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him
1|that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in
1|precisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational
1|conception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot
1|imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so,
1|for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable
1|to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single
1|moment.
1|
1|He could not live, because all man's efforts, all his impulses to
1|life, are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame
1|and obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness,
1|health and disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion
1|and hunger, virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of
1|freedom.
1|
1|A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
1|life.
1|
1|If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
1|contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one
1|and the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that
1|only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.
1|
1|This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom,
1|uncontrolled by experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and
1|felt by everyone without exception, this consciousness without which
1|no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the
1|question.
1|
1|Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing
1|God. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the
1|consciousness of man's freedom? That is a question for theology.
1|
1|The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed
1|in statistics. What is man's responsibility to society, the conception
1|of which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question
1|for jurisprudence.
1|
1|Man's actions proceed from his innate character and the motives
1|acting upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and
1|wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom?
1|That is a question for ethics.
1|
1|Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears
1|subject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from
1|that connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations
1|and of humanity be regarded--as the result of the free, or as the
1|result of the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for
1|history.
1|
1|Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of
1|knowledge--thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the
1|diffusion of printed matter--has the question of the freedom of will
1|been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist. In our
1|time the majority of so-called advanced people--that is, the crowd of
1|ignoramuses--have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one
1|side of the question for a solution of the whole problem.
1|
1|They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,
1|for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
1|movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul
1|and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we
1|sprang from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that
1|thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such
1|ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative
1|zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the
1|thinkers, but has never been denied. They do not see that the role
1|of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an
1|instrument for the illumination of one side of it. For the fact
1|that, from the point of view of observation, reason and the will are
1|merely secretions of the brain, and that man following the general law
1|may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of
1|time, only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands
1|of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories--that
1|from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of
1|necessity; but it does not advance by a hair's breadth the solution of
1|the question, which has another, opposite, side, based on the
1|consciousness of freedom.
1|
1|If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is
1|as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at
1|a certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is
1|the time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of
1|how man's consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
1|necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
1|physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can
1|observe only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe
1|consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.
1|
1|The naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this
1|question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls
1|of a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief
1|superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over
1|the windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should
1|be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything
1|is now so smooth and regular.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER IX
1|
1|
1|For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability,
1|history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which
1|the question is dealt with, that for history this question does not
1|refer to the essence of man's free will but its manifestation in the
1|past and under certain conditions.
1|
1|In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences
1|as experimental science stands to abstract science.
1|
1|The subject for history is not man's will itself but our
1|presentation of it.
1|
1|And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the
1|incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it
1|does for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a
1|presentation of man's life in which the union of these two
1|contradictions has already taken place.
1|
1|In actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly
1|and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although
1|each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.
1|
1|To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined
1|and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the
1|philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that
1|taken by other sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions
1|of freedom and inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the
1|phenomena of life under those definitions, history should deduce a
1|definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves
1|from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and
1|that always appear dependent on these two elements.
1|
1|Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an
1|individual we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly
1|of man's free will and partly of the law of inevitability.
1|
1|Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the
1|incursions of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of
1|someone's action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of
1|several for his walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The
1|degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these
1|people is clearly defined for us.
1|
1|Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
1|differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but
1|every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom
1|and inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure
1|of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more
1|freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive,
1|and the more inevitability the less freedom.
1|
1|The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
1|according to the point of view from which the action is regarded,
1|but their relation is always one of inverse proportion.
1|
1|A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry
1|mother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man
1|trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a
1|defenseless man--seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject
1|to the law of necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which
1|these people were placed, and more free to one who does not know
1|that the man was himself drowning, that the mother was hungry, that
1|the soldier was in the ranks, and so on. Similarly a man who committed
1|a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly
1|in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of
1|inevitability, to someone who considers his action after twenty
1|years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was
1|committed. And in the same way every action of an insane, intoxicated,
1|or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who
1|knows the mental condition of him who committed the action, and
1|seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it. In
1|all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished
1|and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or
1|increased, according to the point of view from which the action is
1|regarded. So that the greater the conception of necessity the
1|smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.
1|
1|Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,
1|and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity
1|and freedom.
1|
1|All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
1|necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:
1|
1|(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the
1|deeds.
1|
1|(2) His relation to time.
1|
1|(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.
1|
1|The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the
1|man's relation to the external world and the greater or lesser
1|clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by
1|the man in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what
1|makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject
1|to necessity than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the
1|actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly
1|populated district, or of one bound by family, official, or business
1|duties, seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than
1|those of a man living in solitude and seclusion.
1|
1|If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything
1|around him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his
1|relation to anything around him, if we see his connection with
1|anything whatever--with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads,
1|the work on which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or
1|the light that falls on the things about him--we see that each of
1|these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some
1|side of his activity. And the more we perceive of these influences the
1|more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our
1|conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases.
1|
1|The second consideration is the more or less evident time relation
1|of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the
1|place the man's action occupies in time. That is the ground which
1|makes the fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the
1|human race, appear evidently less free than a man's entry into
1|marriage today. It is the reason why the life and activity of people
1|who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot
1|seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary, the consequences
1|of which are still unknown to me.
1|
1|The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends
1|in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the
1|performance of the action and our judgment of it.
1|
1|If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same
1|circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me
1|undoubtedly free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then
1|being in different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if
1|that act had not been committed much that resulted from it--good,
1|agreeable, and even essential--would not have taken place. If I
1|reflect on an action still more remote, ten years ago or more, then
1|the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it
1|hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been
1|performed. The farther I go back in memory, or what is the same thing
1|the farther I go forward in my judgment, the more doubtful becomes my
1|belief in the freedom of my action.
1|
1|In history we find a very similar progress of conviction
1|concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of
1|humanity. A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing
1|of all the known participants, but with a more remote event we already
1|see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else
1|possible. And the farther we go back in examining events the less
1|arbitrary do they appear.
1|
1|The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of
1|the crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still
1|seem to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their
1|heroes' will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying
1|its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine
1|the modern history of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the
1|Crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain
1|people. In regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter
1|anyone's head today to suppose that the renovation of the European
1|world depended on Attila's caprice. The farther back in history the
1|object of our observation lies, the more doubtful does the free will
1|of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law
1|of inevitability.
1|
1|The third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that
1|endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which
1|each phenomenon comprehended, and therefore man's every action, must
1|have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a
1|cause of what will follow.
1|
1|The better we are acquainted with the physiological,
1|psychological, and historical laws deduced by observation and by which
1|man is controlled, and the more correctly we perceive the
1|physiological, psychological, and historical causes of the action, and
1|the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the
1|character and mind of the man in question, the more subject to
1|inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others
1|appear.
1|
1|When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a
1|crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we
1|ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we
1|most urgently demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of
1|a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case
1|we recognize in it more individuality, originality, and
1|independence. But if even one of the innumerable causes of the act
1|is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are
1|less insistent on punishment for the crime, or the acknowledgment of
1|the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom of the apparently
1|original action. That a criminal was reared among male factors
1|mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father or
1|mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more
1|comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems
1|less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The
1|founder of a sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when
1|we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity. If we
1|have a large range of examples, if our observation is constantly
1|directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people's
1|actions, their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less
1|free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes. If
1|we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under
1|observation, our conception of their inevitability would be still
1|greater. The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father, the
1|misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company, a drunkard's
1|relapse into drunkenness, and so on are actions that seem to us less
1|free the better we understand their cause. If the man whose actions we
1|are considering is on a very low stage of mental development, like a
1|child, a madman, or a simpleton--then, knowing the causes of the act
1|and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question, we
1|see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as
1|soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the
1|result.
1|
1|On these three considerations alone is based the conception of
1|irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
1|by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less
1|according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
1|which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according
1|to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of
1|the action and its investigation, and according to the greater or
1|lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER X
1|
1|
1|Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually
1|diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser
1|connection with the external world, the greater or lesser remoteness
1|of time, and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in
1|relation to which we contemplate a man's life.
1|
1|So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
1|external world is well known, where the time between the action and
1|its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are
1|most accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability
1|and a minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on
1|external conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the
1|causes of whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of
1|a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom.
1|
1|In neither case--however we may change our point of view, however
1|plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the
1|external world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or
1|short the period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the
1|causes of the action may be--can we ever conceive either complete
1|freedom or complete necessity.
1|
1|(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
1|influence of the external world, we never get a conception of
1|freedom in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what
1|surrounds him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My
1|action seems to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my
1|arm in every direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in
1|which there was least obstruction to that action either from things
1|around me or from the construction of my own body. I chose one out
1|of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest
1|obstacles. For my action to be free it was necessary that it should
1|encounter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being free we must
1|imagine him outside space, which is evidently impossible.
1|
1|(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time
1|of the deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I
1|examine an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it
1|as not being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which
1|it was committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself:
1|could I have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has
1|already passed? To convince myself of this I do not lift it the next
1|moment. But I am not now abstaining from doing so at the first
1|moment when I asked the question. Time has gone by which I could not
1|detain, the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now
1|refrain from lifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it the same
1|that now surrounds me. The moment in which the first movement was made
1|is irrevocable, and at that moment I could make only one movement, and
1|whatever movement I made would be the only one. That I did not lift my
1|arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from
1|lifting it then. And since I could make only one movement at that
1|single moment of time, it could not have been any other. To imagine it
1|as free, it is necessary to imagine it in the present, on the boundary
1|between the past and the future--that is, outside time, which is
1|impossible.
1|
1|(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
1|increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,
1|an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of
1|the expression of will in any action, our own or another's, the
1|first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause,
1|for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to
1|perform an action independently of any cause, but my wish to perform
1|an action without a cause is the cause of my action.
1|
1|But even if--imagining a man quite exempt from all influences,
1|examining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any
1|cause--we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of
1|inevitability as equaled zero, we should even then not have arrived at
1|the conception of complete freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by
1|the external world, standing outside of time and independent of cause,
1|is no longer a man.
1|
1|In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite
1|devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.
1|
1|(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space
1|in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for
1|the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of
1|space. And therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men
1|are defined, there is no complete inevitability but a certain
1|measure of freedom remains.
1|
1|(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action
1|we are examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite,
1|while time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never
1|be absolute inevitability.
1|
1|(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any
1|action, we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and
1|so again we never reach absolute inevitability.
1|
1|But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of
1|freedom to equal zero, we assumed in some given case--as for
1|instance in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot--complete
1|absence of freedom, by so doing we should destroy the very
1|conception of man in the case we are examining, for as soon as there
1|is no freedom there is also no man. And so the conception of the
1|action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any
1|element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a
1|man's completely free action.
1|
1|And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
1|inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of
1|an infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of
1|time, and an infinite series of causes.
1|
1|To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
1|inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond
1|time, and free from dependence on cause.
1|
1|In the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom we
1|should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
1|inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.
1|
1|In the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability
1|we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time,
1|and cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and
1|unlimited would be nothing, or mere content without form.
1|
1|We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man's
1|whole outlook on the universe is constructed--the incomprehensible
1|essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.
1|
1|Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it
1|visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time
1|is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable
1|otherwise. (3) The connection between cause and effect has no
1|beginning and can have no end.
1|
1|Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,
1|consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the
1|fixed moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as
1|living, consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I
1|feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.
1|
1|Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability.
1|Consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom.
1|
1|Freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man's
1|consciousness. Inevitability without content is man's reason in its
1|three forms.
1|
1|Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines.
1|Freedom is the content. Inevitability is the form.
1|
1|Only by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one
1|another as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and
1|separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.
1|
1|Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man's life.
1|
1|Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define
1|one another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.
1|
1|All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation
1|of free will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws
1|of reason.
1|
1|All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
1|relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence
1|of life to the laws of reason.
1|
1|The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious
1|of them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity,
1|animal force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life
1|in man and we call that freedom.
1|
1|But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but
1|felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which
1|we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the
1|first knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton's law), so
1|too the force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which
1|everyone is conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know
1|the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that
1|every man dies, up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and
1|historic laws).
1|
1|All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
1|laws of reason.
1|
1|Man's free will differs from every other force in that man is
1|directly conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way
1|differs from any other force. The forces of gravitation,
1|electricity, or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one
1|another in that they are differently defined by reason. Just so the
1|force of man's free will is distinguished by reason from the other
1|forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it. Freedom,
1|apart from necessity, that is, apart from the laws of reason that
1|define it, differs in no way from gravitation, or heat, or the force
1|that makes things grow; for reason, it is only a momentary undefinable
1|sensation of life.
1|
1|And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly
1|bodies, the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity,
1|or of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of
1|astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the
1|same way does the force of free will form the content of history.
1|But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of
1|this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
1|subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free
1|will in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause
1|forms the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of
1|metaphysics.
1|
1|In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
1|inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital
1|force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above
1|what we know of the essence of life.
1|
1|So also in history what is known to us we call laws of
1|inevitability, what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for
1|history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know
1|about the laws of human life.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XI
1|
1|
1|History examines the manifestations of man's free will in connection
1|with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is,
1|it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a
1|science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.
1|
1|The recognition of man's free will as something capable of
1|influencing historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the
1|same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the
1|heavenly bodies would be for astronomy.
1|
1|That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of
1|laws, that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body
1|moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no
1|conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists.
1|If any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical
1|law can exist, nor any conception of historical events.
1|
1|For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end
1|of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
1|consciousness of man's will in the present moves in space, time, and
1|dependence on cause.
1|
1|The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the
1|more evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define
1|those laws is the problem of history.
1|
1|From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards
1|its subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events
1|in man's freewill, a scientific enunciation of those laws is
1|impossible, for however man's free will may be restricted, as soon
1|as we recognize it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law
1|becomes impossible.
1|
1|Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal,
1|that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we
1|convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes,
1|and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of
1|laws as its problem.
1|
1|The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
1|thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
1|with the self-destruction toward which--ever dissecting and dissecting
1|the causes of phenomena--the old method of history is moving.
1|
1|All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at
1|infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons
1|the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the
1|integration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the
1|conception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property
1|common to all unknown, infinitely small, elements.
1|
1|In another form but along the same path of reflection the other
1|sciences have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity
1|he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction;
1|he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the
1|property of attracting one another, that is, leaving aside the
1|question of the cause of the movement of the bodies, he expressed
1|the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the
1|infinitely small. The same is done by the natural sciences: leaving
1|aside the question of cause, they seek for laws. History stands on the
1|same path. And if history has for its object the study of the movement
1|of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in
1|the lives of individuals, it too, setting aside the conception of
1|cause, should seek the laws common to all the inseparably
1|interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|
1|CHAPTER XII
1|
1|
1|From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the
1|mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth
1|that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the
1|ancients. By disproving that law it might have been possible to retain
1|the old conception of the movements of the bodies, but without
1|disproving it, it would seem impossible to continue studying the
1|Ptolemaic worlds. But even after the discovery of the law of
1|Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time.
1|
1|From the time the first person said and proved that the number of
1|births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this
1|or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and
1|economic conditions, and that certain relations of population to
1|soil produce migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history
1|had been built were destroyed in their essence.
1|
1|By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have
1|been retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to
1|continue studying historic events as the results of man's free will.
1|For if a certain mode of government was established or certain
1|migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such
1|geographic, ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will
1|of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of
1|government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as
1|the cause.
1|
1|And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with
1|the laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative
1|philology, and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.
1|
1|The struggle between the old views and the new was long and
1|stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on
1|guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation.
1|But when truth conquered, theology established itself just as firmly
1|on the new foundation.
1|
1|Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding
1|between the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the
1|same way stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of
1|subverting revelation.
1|
1|In the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes
1|passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret
1|for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the
1|other is the passion for destruction.
1|
1|To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical
1|philosophy, it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would
1|destroy faith in God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the
1|miracle of Joshua the son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of
1|Copernicus and Newton, to Voltaire for example, it seemed that the
1|laws of astronomy destroyed religion, and he utilized the law of
1|gravitation as a weapon against religion.
1|
1|Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
1|inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and
1|evil, and all the institutions of state and church that have been
1|built up on those conceptions.
1|
1|So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of
1|inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion,
1|though the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus
1|in astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation
1|on which the institutions of state and church are erected.
1|
1|As in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of
1|history now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the
1|recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the
1|measure of visible phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability
1|of the earth, in history it is the independence of personality--free
1|will.
1|
1|As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the
1|earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth's
1|fixity and of the motion of the planets, so in history the
1|difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of
1|space, time, and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the
1|independence of one's own personality. But as in astronomy the new
1|view said: "It is true that we do not feel the movement of the
1|earth, but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity, while
1|by admitting its motion (which we do not feel) we arrive at laws,"
1|so also in history the new view says: "It is true that we are not
1|conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our free will we
1|arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on the external
1|world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws."
1|
1|In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness
1|of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did
1|not feel; in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce
1|a freedom that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of
1|which we are not conscious.

1|Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
1|preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
1|and editing by those who wish to do so.
1|
1|Most people start at our Web sites at:
1|http://gutenberg.net or
1|http://promo.net/pg
1|
1|These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
1|Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
1|eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).
1|
1|
1|Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
1|can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
1|also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
1|indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
1|announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.
1|
1|http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or

1|91 or 90

1|Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
1|as it appears in our Newsletters.

1|Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
1|
1|We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
1|time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
1|to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
1|searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
1|projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
1|per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
1|million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
1|files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
1|We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
1|If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
1|will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.
1|
1|The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
1|This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
1|which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

1|fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
1|disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
1|you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

1|ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
1|This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
1|is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
1|through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
1|Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
1|on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and

1|below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
1|under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
1|
1|Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
1|any commercial products without permission.
1|
1|To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
1|efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
1|works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
1|medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
1|things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
1|corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
1|intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
1|disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
1|codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

1|you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
1|time to the person you received it from. If you received it
1|on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
1|such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
1|copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
1|choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
1|receive it electronically.
1|
1|THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
1|WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
